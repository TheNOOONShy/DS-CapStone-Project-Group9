Theme: Stress: Coping and family

Caller: Once a month for half an hour and you know, we came out and you know we had to talk to our visitors through a- through a Skype or whatever set up they had. And you know my- my yard has, actually, fortunately have tablets here. We have tablets so we email our family from our cells and you know, they can contact us and- and get a hold of us immediately.</br></br>
But you know their situation barely opened up last month so we get one hug in the beginning, and one hug at the end. And it’s only one visitor and we can’t buy food and it’s only a bottle of water that they give us but, you know. For us you know we’re so blessed to have that because we didn’t have that for over a year.</br></br>

But you know, that’s where it’s at for now, hopefully. Every- every two weeks we get our rooms opened up more and more and hopefully they allow visitors. They expand it you know because now it’s only once a week. If- if your people get tested three days before they come in and then- they have to take that rapid test when they want to come in one a week so. You know, that’s pretty much- they have to pay 100 bucks. To take that 15 minute test. And that’s pretty taxing on our families.</br></br>
That’s not- that right there’s not cool. Not everybody has that you know. That- that pretty much visiting situations right now. If you got- if you can pay for your test- your rapid COVID test and your family can come in. And if not, that’s not happening.</br></br>

UCI: How have you been coping with everything?</br></br>

Caller: You know it’s- you know it’s not. I mean right here we got the tablets so, you know we’re not as stressed out. It hasn’t hit my family situation too bad you know, a couple people have got it and you know, they survived but. Now I have other friends and family who have- whose family hit it and you know it’s close home. And you know, all those who died and grandparents and you- you know it’s been hard.</br></br>
It’s been hard on them, seeing them go through it you know. That affects us because we love them you know, and it’s like “wow” you know. It’s not real until- for us you know, because we’re in our own little world. We’re in our own little box. You know, it’s not real until it happens either to your family or somebody close to you.</br></br>
That’s, it’s been depressing. And that respect to see it on the news. You know, a lot of people- it’s harsh I mean I imagine doing the same for everyone out there.</br></br>
