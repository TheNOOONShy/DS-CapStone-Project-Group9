This letter is written by a person incarcerated at Merced USP Atwater Federal Center.</br></br>

This institution has been excellent when it comes to social distancing and sanitation protocols. They issued out numerous face masks we can wash in the washing machine, which is a plus because imagine the prisoners who don’t even have that.</br></br>

There’s plenty of chemicals being utilized and passed around. There was a minor outbreak in the beginning but being able not to panic and take the right precautionary steps to manage it, the staff as well as inmates in my opinion did a wonderful job on locking down and getting the institution under control till everyone was tested and cleared. And those who were unfortunate were fortunate to get well, thankfully no one passed.</br></br>

Then you have federal and state prisons, there’s a huge difference. State is mostly filled with California natives, while federal has inmates from all over the world and all of the states. So imagine being from a whole different state and your loved ones can’t afford or are limited to how they can see or visit you. We don’t have tablets like other prisons so add that to the emotional stress, frustration or whatever one may be feeling.</br></br>

Me personally being raised in foster care, I’ve pretty much been surviving on my own. I don’t really get mail or correspondence. I used to seek penpal sites but that becomes overwhelming meeting numerous new individuals, who might be in and out. And I just got tired of opening up to strangers just to feel a feeling of abandonment again and again. I state that because this project is a wonderful thing and I guess with your permission I will let others know they can reach out.
