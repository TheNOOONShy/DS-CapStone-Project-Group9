This story was told by a person incarcerated at Theo Lacy.</br></br>

UCI: Mhm, that’s good. That's good to know. So is there anything else you'd like people to know about your experience?</br></br>

Caller: Um, well, that’s pretty much- not really, no. I don't know, I guess I can't really think of- you know, without getting into all the things that go on upstate, yeah, in the county jail things are definitely different. I can't really- it's just less crowded. It seems to be much more friendly, because it's less crowded. There's a lot of less- turns out the racial tension is very minimal, if any, I think because of the less crowded situation.</br></br>

And I don't know. Even the deputies are all- they don't mess with us like they used to. They used to really harass us and give us a hard time in a lot of scenarios I could go into, but since this pandemic, they seem to have all been on Midol, you know? If that makes any sense. They're all- they're all very laid back and friendly and cooperative and…fair. Fair is a very good word. Much more fair than in the past. And- I don’t know. They seem to actually have a heart.
