This story was told by a person incarcerated at Chuckawalla.</br></br>

Caller: Alrighty. Well, of course, you know, what's been going on here at, you know, CVSP, at Chuckawalla Valley State Prison. It's just been hectic. You know, here we're where inmates come from different prisons here.</br></br>In fact last night, there was an inmate that was very sick that just came back, just came off of the bus. According to officers, he was quarantined for 14 days. Well, somehow or another he's been sick for the past few days and now the whole cube, which is cube 17, they're in quarantine. And according to them, this gentleman has COVID-19.</br></br>Not to mention you have several other inmates that are housed here with us. All of us here in our building is free of COVID-19 at this time and moment. But bringing inmates from another facility and transferring them from one yard to another, all it does is put us susceptible to the situation, the pandemic. Last week we had a big breakout on three block, and I am in four block.</br></br>Well, in three block they quarantined the building being that there was more than one individual that was with the virus. Well, the officer that worked there that morning, she ended up quarantining in our building the next day. So, we're like, well what's going on here?</br></br>You know, they just quarantined that building, so why would she come over here and work with us? Are you trying to spread the pandemic or are you trying to, you know, get us sick again? Well, throughout the day, there was times that she was not only half-masked, she didn't have her mask on. Majority of the inmates are running around with, you know, half mask, if not without the mask, which they should be. It's just been hectic. Not to mention all my loved ones.</br></br>You know, all of this going, it's been really hard. You know, here we got no visits, you know, getting in touch with our loved ones is hard as it is. You know, we're grateful with GTL that they're giving us free days throughout the month. But it's put a hardship on them. Every time I call my loved ones, my girlfriend, the first thing they're thinking, oh, are you being moved? Are you being shipped to another yard?</br></br>Did you get it again? So, it doesn't make their mind at ease, it's not at ease for them whatsoever. It's very stressful for them. Not to mention it's very stressful for us as inmates being that we're in our cube, settled, and then say they randomly test us and one of the inmates in my cube tests positive, well next thing you know that cube is up and moving.</br></br>Well, doesn't nobody want to lose, you know, their rack, they're comfortable with the cubies that they have around them. And after the 14-day quarantine, we're dispersed throughout the prison. That doesn't mean that we're going to go to our exact cube that we were in. Well, we can go to another yard, go to a cube, and then next thing you know, that prisoner comes up positive and here I go again.</br></br>It's monotonous. Yeah, we don't seem to understand why would they do something like that when they should just quarantine the whole building. The way these officers, these people are doing, CDCR is doing this is all backwards, we don't seem to understand it. You know, we know that they're clueless on what's going on also. If the, you know, virus - but at the same time, to up and move a whole cube or two makes no sense when you should just quarantine the building.</br></br>Quarantine the yard. Why are you having inmates come from another building, another facility, a different prison and end up here just because they are out of reception? Well, that's exactly where it's coming from. If it's not coming from other inmates from different prisons, it's coming from the officers itself. If it's not the officers, then it's coming from the free staff. That's exactly how we received it in the first place.</br></br>Today we had a situation with an individual asking a sergeant about sanitizer. Well, the officer, the sergeant in fact told the inmate well, don't you guys get soap? Well yeah, we receive one bar of soap a week. Well, then wash your hands. You know, so why'd you put us the sanitizer dispensers in the restrooms just to make it look good for the CDCR or for the ombudsman that comes around for his COVID, you know, check to make it look good?</br></br>They've been out of it for almost a month now. So, why'd you put them up? Every time we ask a different officer on a different shift, they say we don't know. We don't know. So, then we ask the sergeant. He says he doesn't know. First thing the inmate did on a rebuttal with it, with the sergeant, he told them, well, then since you don't know sergeant, should I ask your lieutenant?</br></br>Oh, oh, you're going to go over my head? Well, he's just trying to get the answer. He wants to know what's going on with the sanitizer, you know. There's a virus going on, we have to clean every single day. We have to clean our cubes. We have to clean around us, clean the tables. Keep everything with our mask on and so forth. But you're not helping us with that with the sanitizer.</br></br>It's not helping. So, how is it going to help us in any way if we don't have the materials, the chemicals to do so? They want us to clean the cubes, okay, that's fine, we have no problem doing that. Where's the chemicals? Where's the cell block? Where's the material that we need to keep it clean and to keep it sanitized? What, you give us one ounce, a spray bottle for the whole building?</br></br>That's not sufficient. There's 24 cubes in here. Eight men per cube, 192 inmates in one building, and one bottle, one spray bottle which is a 32-ounce spray bottle to do the whole building? Let's get real with this, this is ridiculous. A lot of the inmates don't want to stand up and say anything because they don't want to get shipped out and moved to another building. Which, you know, that's all of our nightmare.</br></br>But at the same time, what's most important is, you know, our loved ones. We don't want to put them in a, you know, scare. We don't want to put them stressed out. A lot of things are not going as procedures and they say one thing, not to mention again the COVID announcement. Well, for the first few months, we were able to hear it, you know, loud and clear over the speaker monitor and so forth on the yard and everything.</br></br>Now it's so muffled and low, we don't even know what they're saying anymore. So, we're like well, what's the sense of you announcing the COVID announcement and procedures when you're not even putting it on loudspeaker. So, it's no fun game whatsoever. Every time we try to get something done with the officers and ask them for gloves so we can clean. And more rags or again, material spray liquid, they tell us that oh, we're out. Laundry's out. We don't have none. So, we're not sure what to do. And so, we use our personal property to do it. It just gets old. It really does. If you have any questions you want to ask me, please feel free to.</br></br>UCI: Okay, sure. Yeah, I can ask you some questions. So, can you remember from the beginning of the virus, can you kind of remember like a month by month breakdown?</br></br>Caller: Well, from the beginning we were getting a test every single day. Excuse me, we were getting a temperature check and we were also, that was three times a day or three times a day.</br></br>Two times a day, excuse me, we were getting a temperature check. And then about a month, maybe two months later, we ended up receiving the swab, nasal swab test. And the majority of us came back positive. And then as time grew, all of us were positive. So, it was fine.</br></br>And then it came back with 12 inmates that were negative. So, they had them sign a waiver saying that they'd like to stay here a month with the rest of the inmates that were positive or be transferred to another yard. Which at that time, their yards were infected also. So, it didn't make a difference what yard an inmate got transferred to.</br></br>So, that was no help right there. And after we got swabbed again, this is probably month later, the test started coming back little by little negative. But as for the [unintelligible] anything that we [unintelligible], it was limited.</br></br>It was actually more scarce then then it is now. They weren't giving us any type of, you know, chemicals whatsoever because they said we don't have none, we don't have none. But yet, you know, the porters, they have to do what they do, which we understand. But at the same time, we needed for, you know, to keep anything and everything wiped down. They supplied us with five masks which are fairly decent.</br></br>But as time went on, of course they get used. And to hold them on our face, you know, the bands get stretched out. So, we improvise. And of course, that ain't working, you know, so you have to discard it and turn it in. And of course, you get somebody else's used one. So, that's kind of it in a nutshell.</br></br>UCI: Okay, for our last minute, is there anything else that you would like to share about your experience?</br></br>Caller: Like I said, you know, they're putting us - we're all clean and healthy in this area. And then they bring inmates. That's the most important part, you know, we don't seem to understand why they would bring an infected inmate in with us that are not infected.</br></br>UCI: Okay. So, I want to encourage you to please have your friends call.
