Hello, my name is [redacted].</br></br> 

Well I got here in prison on 11-2020. Iâ€™m still here on A yard. When I first arrived to the prison, I got tested for the COVID-19 before we was able to go to through R&R, where they processed us at after we went through all the steps before getting housed in. That is a two-man cell, and we were housed there for 14 days while I was housed in. 

There were nurses there, day in and day out, swabbing and temp checks on a daily basis. Now my 14 days was up in. They had inmates that came from over the wall from B, C, D yard to be housed in because someone tested positive, or a possible.
