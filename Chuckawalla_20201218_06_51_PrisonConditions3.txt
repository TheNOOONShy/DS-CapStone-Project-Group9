This story was told by a person incarcerated at Chuckawalla.</br></br>UCI: UCI: Yes, no, we so appreciate this, and we so appreciate you calling. Is there anything that if someone were to, you know, ask you about your experience, is there anything you would want them to really, kind of, understand?</br></br> 

Like the main part of the pandemic, you know? With the free and open population, is there anything that really sticks out to you during your experience? Besides what you’ve described?</br></br>  Caller: Well, I mean, this type of condition we’re living in. It is overcrowded from what is the designed capacity of this housing unit. It’s been overcrowded for many years. They’ve tried to reduce it but this prison, this prison system is a business.</br></br> 

It’s a big business that makes a lot of money for the state, and the, and the economy of the state, and the surrounding towns. Nobody wants to reduce the size of prisons because of how much money it makes. So, and no matter what someone says, money is put forward to fight any plans to reduce the population.</br></br>  The quality of the sentencing that people receive in court is outrageous for the crimes that they have been convicted of. But that is what this business is all about. Now with the pandemic, that just makes it a little easier because we can’t social distance in here.</br></br> 

It ran through the every - yeah, we cannot keep our six feet apart. It’s impossible. You’ve got each cubicle, most of them have 10 bunks, they’re down to eight inmates per cubicle.</br></br> 

But, you, you know, you cannot keep, there’s someone within six feet of you most of the time. So, there’s not, you know, unless changes come to the whole prison system, this is how it is, and this is a warning. This pandemic, of what could happen in the future. That’s how I see it.
