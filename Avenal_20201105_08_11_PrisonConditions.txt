This story was told by a person incarcerated at Avenal.</br></br>
UCI: How was COVID-19 handled at your facility at the beginning of the outbreak?</br></br>
Caller: Okay. It was a cluster, basically. As things started, they started shifting people from building to building, trying to- they put all the people that they felt were at risk, originally, into one building that would be all the people that were 60 and above.</br></br>
They moved, actually, into my building, into six particular dorms. And that lasted for about two weeks. They were, you know, supposed to be isolated in there.</br></br>There was only going to be four people to a dorm. But, within a couple weeks, they realized that, you know, they couldn't do that in the building and still maintain the population.</br></br>
So they ended up throwing people, you know, in with the bunkies. And every one of those dorms, you know, was up to 80 people within the first few weeks. So their initial response– maybe, with good intention but very limited foresight, you know, they, you know, every building was at, you know, 80 percent capacity.</br></br>And there was no way that they were going to reduce the numbers in the dorm and still maintain, you know, what they considered social distancing within our dorm. Most of our dorms hold 10 or 12 people.</br></br>And their solution to have social distancing in the dorm was to reduce that to eight people to a dorm. So I mean we, you know- got to, you know, double bunk for maybe, three feet, either above or below someone else. And, you know, a foot or two away from the bunk next to us.</br></br>So it was very limited success, early on and for several months, actually, before they finally seemed to have a system that made at least a bit of sense in getting people out of the building, now that, when they're positive.</br></br>
UCI: Right. And is it being handled differently, do you think, now?</br></br>
Caller: Yes. Like I said, they're testing all the people that have been negative throughout this on a weekly basis now. And, if anybody does turn up positive, they are removing them from this yard and putting them in a building on another yard. Where, I assume, you know, is just strictly for people that have tested positive.
