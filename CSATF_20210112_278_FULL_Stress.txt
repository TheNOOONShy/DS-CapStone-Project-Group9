This letter was written by a person incarcerated at SATF (California Substance Abuse Treatment Facility and State Prison).</br></br>The pandemic and I,</br></br>It sucks to be a victim when someone or something is the reason for your suffering. I have in the past taken the role of the bad guy. Yes, that is what you call a criminal. When I was 18, I began a 58 month sentence.</br></br> 

Just because I was the reason for the suffering did not make my consequences easier to live.</br></br>But I knew my place and knew that I owed karma, victims, society, the courts a debt. So, I paid it. Although the tactics of the San Diego DA’s office caused its own set of problems that made me the victim of a harsh existence in prison.</br></br> 

A conviction that painted a target on my back. Something that I did not deserve legally or morally.</br></br>Basically, it was easier to create charges that would force me into accepting a plea-bargain if I did not want to be made a “pinata”, broke to little pieces by hands and knives. The reason for sharing this is to express my knowledge of being in both sides.</br></br>COVID-19 is mother-nature. Forcing millions to become victims. At this point in my life I have lost friends, family, freedom, choice and self-endurance. But not from COVID-19 (but because some person chose to falsely accuse me of a crime).</br></br> 

That’s right, I went from being a young 28-year-old, not perfect but happy. My only transgression is having no standards and engaging in sex with an ugly troll of a person in a short black skirt. Then with a snap of a finger I am sitting in a police station under arrest.</br></br>I do not know personally the complete damage that COVID-19 causes. My comparison is my opinion and open to correction. My goal is to formulate a scenario where society can view my life and judge me by truth not by a fabricated scenario.</br></br> 

What if a hospital turned you away, with a statement like “we are making the business decision not to take on your case.” I was given this reason by a firm that is associated by the “Multi-Million-dollar advocates”. They even have a small stamp.</br></br>OK if you were told by the emergency room that you had to call all other options before you can be attended there. The innocence Project has sent me the same questionnaire about eight times since the end of 2016 till 2019. With a clear statement that until I am left with nothing but a pen in my hand, they would even consider my case.</br></br> 

I expect a questionnaire that that time too.</br></br>I would like to know from someone with COVID-19 how much rejection could they put up with before their situation is considered helpless. Do you continue to walk the streets of your city with a cough? How long can you eat food that you cannot taste? How long can you stay away from your kids without causing them harm?</br></br>Believe me my prayers are with you all sick or safe, rich or poor. I wish you all health and love. I myself believe it is always interesting to view a convicts point of sight. I pray that my letter gets printed.</br></br> 

I need the help of the common folk. Because the legal community has found it easier to ignore me, that if the coercion of a messed-up system is left alone than only a few innocent people will rot away in a cement cage.</br></br>I want this letter to be a point of reference when some other paper of any lonesome is found. I have the need of volunteers to assist me in building a network. Even if I have to create a non-profit organization in order to be taken seriously. Anyone can get the J-pay app, create an account, and have access to emails.
