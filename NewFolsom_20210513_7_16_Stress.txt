This story was told by a person incarcerated at New Folsom.</br></br>UCI: So how have you been coping with that?</br></br>Caller: I haven't man. I been low-key going crazy a little bit. There were times where I even had suicidal ideations man. I feel like they was not trying to help.</br></br>We have paperwork in here. We file grievances and stuff and showing that, "Hey man, we negative," and they still had us locked down. They don't care it was just, oh yeah they was enjoying it in a way.</br></br>UCI: And so, what would you say that they could do to make the situation better at your facility?</br></br>Caller: They can start giving us what we got coming. There are people in this sections waiting for packages, canteen for a month, two months for packages. I got a notice in the mail, 'cause I got a prepaid account with a package company access, saying that March 29th was when my package came in the prison and I ain't seen this yet.</br></br>They saying, "Oh they don't know where it's at." Bruh, how do you lose something that's mine? Man, now I'm starting to believe that they gave it to another inmate man, 'cause it's a whole lotta funny shit, cops roaring up on inmates, man what the hell.
