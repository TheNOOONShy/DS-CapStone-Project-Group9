Hi PrisonPandemic,</br></br>

This is my story during COVID-19 pandemic lockdown.</br></br>

My story gone back to 2017, when I got skin cancer, how I got skin cancer, well that is a story not related to COVID-19.</br></br>

So here I go, in 2017 I was diagnosis with skin cancer. It was not so bad at that time, I had it cut out/remove in 2018/2019 and stitch up all was well. And then in late 2019, the scar area where the cancer had been re-open and getting bad. So I saw the prison doctor and he told me that it look like the cancer had return.</br></br>

So as time gone by into 2020 I been in contact with some of the doctors that did my surgery back in 2018, early 2019, that was my first surgery.</br></br>

One of the surgeon told me that my cancer had for sure return and it now look worse then before and getting bigger, but they tell me that they do need to do some test for a more extensive surgery then the last one.</br></br> 

So I told them OK. But you got to tell the prison know when. But at that same time the pandemic was already affecting the surgeries at the hospital I was going to. Then all out going for surgeries from the prison stop because of COVID-19. So I wait and wait but all I got was delays.</br></br> 

Days, weeks, months gone by. My cancer is now eating my face on my left side. As time goes by and I had not heard from no one, no prison doctor or hospital doctors. And now my cancer is out of control and moving under the bags of my left eye and down to my jaw-bone all at that same time.</br></br> 

So now things are looking so bad, that the prison doctor had to do something. He made some calls, to UC Cancer Center and told them about my cancer. That I need cancer treatment now. Now UC Hospital provide me with doctors and other test to help them plans to fight the cancer. They told me it not good and I need to have it remove from a large area on my left side of my face.</br></br> 

I need to get a skin-graft, after surgery to remove your cancer this skin-graft will come from your back. Then to harvest a rib (breastbone) to replace my jaw and another small rib under my breast area for a new nose-bridge. And a eye-lid surgery to put in an important weight because when they gave me my first surgery to remove the cancer the surgeon had damage a nerve that work my eye-lid to open and closes over my eye.</br></br>

I had to get two surgeries for that damage and still my eye on my left and my right don’t work like it should. I also have issues with my noses, and the skin-graft is OK, but my looks well it’s hard to look in a mirror. So UC Hospital Cancer Center, doctors tell me after your surgery and you recover, which will take sometime you will be receiving radiation treatments for seven weeks. 30 or 40 every day treatment.</br></br> 

So now they prepared me with more test to see if I’m able to do this surgery all of them in one day.</br></br> 

I’m 64 years old and this surgery was 12 and a half hours long. This was a risk surgery for my age. Now to end my story, my surgery was a successful series of achievements for me to overcome. But now come recover and then radiation.</br></br>

14 days to recover in the hospital that was hard being hand-cuffed to the bed and leg also cuff to the bed, one hand and one leg each.</br></br> 

So 14 days to recover, then I was move to a prison medical confinement (captive) housing on a medical-hold. Until after my radiation treatments. That did not happen for another two months, got my treatments. But I was at this new prison for four months before I could get my medical-hold lifted for I can go back to my home-prison and to return to normal program.</br></br>

Now I’m off my medical-hold and my home-prison pick me up and take me to the home-prison and I find out that I got to do 14 days in quarantine (isolation) in the cell that use be call (the hold). My 14 days are up WOW. Some journey five months after surgery and radiation, treatments, medical-hold, quarantine in the hold.</br></br>

All and all my medical journey took one years and two months. That my COVID-19 story.</br></br> 

You are welcome to edit my story as you can see that my writing are a little off. I try to write this story has it was. There was a lot more to this journey I was on for sometime.</br></br> 

Please write me back if you use my story. I would like it to be told to you reader.</br></br> 

In January I got my first vaccination-shot and then my second shot in February I’m good to go.</br></br>

Coping with the pandemic and my medical need with skin-cancer and all that had happen in the last 14 was very hard for me. I did had to see a mental health professional to keep from losing it. Once again thank you.
