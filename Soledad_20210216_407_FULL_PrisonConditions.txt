This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Soledad.</br></br>

Reason: A cry for clarity and help!</br></br>

To Whom It May Concern:</br></br>

My current facility and housing location are as follows: the Correctional Training Facility-Soledad-Central Yard. This letter is simply to obtain clarity on some of the conduct here at CTF-Soledad, pertaining to cell/bed moves between infected/non-infected COVID-19 inmates.</br></br>

Background. I am confined to my cell for 24 hours a day, and have been for the past ten (10) months or so. I receive a thirty (30) minute shower every three (3) days. I receive one and a half hour of recreation time every five to seven days. I have thankfully never contracted COVID-19. I have a medical condition. Obstructive sleep apnea, (OSA) and I use a continuous pressure airway passage (CPAP) machine nightly. I have received my first vaccine shot.</br></br> 

Now currently this institution CTF-Soledad are currently moving previously infected inmates into wings and cells of inmates who have had no infection.</br></br>

These inmates they are moving around the prison work for the prison industry authority (PIA). For instance, I was told on or about December 12, 2020 I had to take a cellmate who works for PIA. I refused to take him, in return I was given a rules violation report 128 saying I “disobeyed a direct order.”</br></br>

The inmate works everyday, around other inmates who live in other wings within CTF-Soledad/Central. This inmate and others are exposed to free staff and whom ever else is working that day. As I mentioned, I have been isolated, why put me at risk?</br></br>

Is this prison doing the right or just thing? Are they suppose to be moving inmates like I mentioned? I understand space is needed, however there has to be a safer way to go about making more room. I have fears my life doesn’t mean anything. They are forcing these bed moves! Please help!</br></br>
