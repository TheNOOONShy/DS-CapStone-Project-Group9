This story was told by a person incarcerated at John Latorraca Correctional Center.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, but you know, they really don't care. And then, when the guards walk in to do the walk-through, they don't ever wear their mask or anything like that, either.</br></br>

UCI: Wow.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah. Like, they don't - like they just don't really care.</br></br>

UCI: Mhmm. And what's the vaccination situation at, like?</br></br>

Caller: They offer the vaccination here.</br></br>

UCI: Mhmm.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, they do - they do offer it.</br></br>

UCI: Mhmm. Is there anything else you want people to know about your experience?</br></br>

Caller: Other than they give us diluted chemicals all the time. They don't - they haven't offered us anything, really. Like, they don't offer us no towels to clean, nothing.</br></br>

They don't offer us no good chemicals to clean anything. They don't offer us any soaps. We have to buy all our soaps. They - they only wash our clothes one time a week. Other than that, you know, we're just - we're just living in a dirty place.</br></br>

UCI: Mhmm.</br></br>

Caller: Mhmm. Unbearable environment. And then they keep our family from us, too, which is - I don't think that's right, either. You know, at least - at least they should - at least they should give us the tablet so we could FaceTime our families, at least. If we can't get visits.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: That's about it, I mean. I don't know. I just called you guys just to let you know what's going on, really, though.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah. Thank you so much for reaching out.</br></br>

Caller: When I was in Solano, the - the pandemic first came out. It was basically like the same thing. They really didn't do nothing, either. All they did was give us four orange masks. All they did was give us four little, orange masks and that was it.</br></br>

UCI: Wow. For the entirety of your stay there?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah. Well, I was only there for, I got out early that time. I got out early, but that's when the pandemic first came out last year, like around July. And then, all I remember is them giving us four masks. And then, really, there was no - there was only so much they could do about social distancing.</br></br>

And they got us in this - well, yeah, that's all they really did. That's all I could really remember.</br></br>

But in the dorm that - in the dorm I'm in right now, we only got, there's 20 people and we only got one phone. One phone for all of us to use. There's only one toilet for 20 people to use. The other toilet is broken.</br></br>

They never did nothing about it. The urinal is broken. I remember one time, I was in the jail for three months, taking a shower in cold showers. Literally in cold showers for three months straight.</br></br>

UCI: Wow.</br></br>

Caller: Like, literally, we had just cold, like five minutes just to take a shower real quick and jump out because it's so cold.
