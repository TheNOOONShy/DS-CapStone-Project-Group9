This story was told by a person incarcerated at Chuckawalla.</br></br>

UCI: What facility are you currently housed at?</br></br>

Caller: Chuckawalla State Prison.</br></br>

UCI: What has the COVID situation been like at your facility?</br></br>

Caller: Man, it’s - it's, let's say, everything that makes common sense to the pandemic situation of social distancing. It’s totally backwards. Because you got other inmates and you got each inmate is not social distancing. Each bunk is right next to the next bunk, and I have a bunkie, and we’re in a cube, probably about 30'x10' feet.</br></br> 

And you got 10 people all in one little cube, and nobody’s wearing masks there. And, you know, everybody is sitting with each other. So it’s like, you know, where’s the social distancing?</br></br>

And there’s no, like, even though we do social distancing in a dayroom and stuff like that, you still gotta go back to your bunk and live with someone that lives right underneath you or above you and the next person, or you know, all together you got about four people living all the way around you plus your bunkie. So that makes five. So there’s no social distancing whatsoever here in this, in this prison. At all.</br></br>

UCI: How has the vaccination situation been like at your facility?</br></br>

Caller: Huh?</br></br>

UCI: How has the vaccination situation been like?</br></br>

Caller: The medical has been, as far as I know, they've been doing as much as they possibly can, know what I mean? They, they’ve been offering us medical treatment, checking our temperatures and stuff like that. But it’s like, you know, and then when one person gets, you know, a positive test reading, they lock us down, and it cuts us off from everything. The whole building goes on quarantine, and that person gets taken out.</br></br>

It just doesn’t make sense, you know? They take one person from one building to a whole other building that has other other buildings going into that same one. And so it’s like, it’s just spreading everywhere. Like, they make it worse.</br></br> 

You know? And it’s just when they try to quarantine you, you get quarantined with other people that are sick, and you get quarantined, you're - everything shuts down.</br></br>

There’s no school. There’s no - there’s no chapel. There’s nothing. All they give us is food, and you know, a minimum, a little bit of yard.</br></br>

So you’re in here with over about 250 inmates in one little small building, and they’re trying to say social distancing and all that stuff, but it’s not. There’s no social distancing whatsoever.</br></br>

And I understand that they’ve been trying to provide us with masks and stuff, but, yeah, you’re trying to provide us with masks, but you’re not even providing us with social distancing. When it’s by law that we have to be a certain amount of distance from everybody. From, you know, by law, now, you know?</br></br> 

Basically, to follow the law and right now we’re breaking the law, the whole prison is breaking the law, you know? The way I see it.</br></br>

But nobody’s gonna say anything or do anything about it 'cause the CDC was somehow trying to overlook it or think of some kind of different way of explaining, "Well, we can’t do this because we got no bedrooms," or whatever. But it’s not, it’s not our issue. The issue is that the CDC is breaking their law, you know, of social distancing and taking away from us, and making us go through it by taking away our - our rights to go and pray in the chapel.</br></br>

Okay, well, and they’re putting, they’re putting inmates inside the chapel. They’re putting inmates in classrooms to quarantine these people that are sick, and that came up positive, and then expecting us to go back into those classrooms, and these chapels to, to have services or to have a program for education. So I don’t understand how that’s supposed to work, you know? I mean, all they’re doing is spreading it all over the facility when you do that, you know?</br></br>

And I don’t, I don’t see how they don’t go — get down on their, their staff here, you know? More - they need to up the, up the safety concerns with the staff coming here, ‘cause that’s the only way we’re getting it, is through the staff bringing it from the outside coming in. It’s not us, we can’t just get it out of the air, you know? So, so that’s another thing.</br></br>

UCI: How has the situation at your facility affected your loved ones?</br></br>

Caller: Horribly, you know? I can’t - I can’t have no visits. And, you know, I can’t send stuff out like, you know, I’m Native American, and I can’t send my beadwork out to send to my family, religious items or anything like that. It’s been very rough, you know? Especially for us Native Americans, we’re already going through it as it is right here.</br></br>

In the facility, they are denying us our spiritual rights right here in this facility, as Native Americans. They’re trying - they accommodate everybody else religious rights except for us, us Natives. We have a grounds, but we can’t get to it.</br></br> 

We have spiritual items in the chapel that we can’t have no access to it, but they give access to the Muslims. They give access to any other religion. But the Native Americans, I think, is kinda, like, I hate to say it, but I think it’s kinda a racist prison or whatever.</br></br>

But who am I to say what really is going on, ‘cause nobody’s telling us nothing. Everybody’s just telling us, "Oh, due to COVID, you can’t have -" Well then, why isn’t it, they, you telling the Christians, the Muslims, and the Catholics that? Why are we put on the back burner all the time with our spiritual, spiritual needs?</br></br>

And that’s a big thing here, and we keep getting denied just because we’re inmates and they got the upper hand. It’s like, we’ve been, we’ve been trying to fight for all that since I’ve been here. And we haven’t got nowhere.</br></br>

And, and for us Native Americans here, we’re never heard. We’re never heard. We’re always kicking heads. "Oh, you guys just wanna, you know, do this and that." And they’re always thinking of something to block us from our spiritual rights and our spiritual rights here as Native Americans is horrible.</br></br>

It’s rough for us Native Americans. Not even on our reservation, and even in our streets, it’s rough for us, and we’re always being put down in here, you know? And it’s been really rough for my family because there’s been passing aways in our family, and I can’t practice my spiritual ways because they’re denying us our spiritual ways here. So yeah, it’s taken a big toll on my life.</br></br>

And, you know, I don’t know who’s the real criminal now, you know? I mean, I know what I’ve done, whatever I’ve done in my life to be here but to to be here, I’m already serving my time. But you treat us like we’re not human and treat us like, oh, we’re just a number. That’s inhumane.</br></br> 

How - how would that make you feel after so long? You start to hate. You start to feel not heard. And you - that turns into anger. And then, you know, then you just turn to other stuff that’s not even important. You’re not trying to fix yourself no more. You’re being humiliated, you’re being discriminated about your race, you’re being, you know?</br></br>

But CDC has a great way of covering everything up. And if you don’t do what’s right, then I don’t know. It’s horrible, but that’s my big issue here with the pandemic and what I’m going through in my own personal experience. You know, as the pandemic, it’s really been taking a toll on us.</br></br>

UCI: How have you been coping with this crisis?</br></br>

Caller: Well, I got no choice but to just pray. Pray and talk to family whenever I can. I mean, hopefully, everything goes back to normal, and just try to stay positive about it. It’s rough though, you know?</br></br>

Getting a lot of people in here get really stressed out and start turning on each other for no reason. Just ‘cause it’s overwhelming. You’re crowded in one little space, and you can’t do nothing. You can sit there and write grievances and all this and that, but where does that get you? It doesn’t get you nowhere in here.</br></br> 

You’re never heard. You’re just another inmate complaining, that’s all they look at it as.</br></br>

UCI: What else do you want people to know about your experience?</br></br>

Caller: That what they say on TV about prisons and stuff and how they’re trying to help us — they’re not. I don’t see nobody getting help in here. I don’t see anybody saying, "Oh, this is what they’re doing for us," or anybody saying, "Hey, they’re actually making a progress." They’re not doing this, you know?</br></br>

And things that they do have available for us, you got a thousand inmates on one yard. You can only have 15 inmates in one class. That’s helping us, and then there’s a long line for like two, three years. It doesn’t make sense.
