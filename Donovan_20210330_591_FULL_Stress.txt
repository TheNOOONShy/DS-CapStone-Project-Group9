This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Donovan.</br></br>Hello to the above.</br></br>
There’s a small about amounts of weight inmates has gathered up upon this huge pandemic. And weights only the much stress and how much we go against while being on a lock down.</br></br>

So weight is something I use to describe stress and the things like, for example, having to watch health and friends cover their mouth and have to struggle through this has taken much stress.</br></br> 

But to begin with a sad hope and to end it with a happy progress is a progress that while you continue on with your life you’re able to know and learn something new every day and that’s an experience worth fighting for.</br></br>So UCI</br></br>
I’m wishing you the best of life time and hope for the positive. Because you’re a human and to be able to share and keep the same way. It’s called hopefulness and I’m wondering if I’ll have good hope.
