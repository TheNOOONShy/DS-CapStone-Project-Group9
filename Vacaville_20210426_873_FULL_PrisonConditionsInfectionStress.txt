This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Vacaville.</br></br>

April 22, 2021</br></br>

I got your letter the other day, you want to know how I'm coping with the pandemic inside prison. It has been hard at times and other times I never noticed. I always wash my hands often and I keep my cell clean. About my safety inside there is nowhere to run and hide.</br></br>

We get sick because the guards and free staff bring it to us. As far as medical helping us they test us all the time. I got both of my shots, thank God for that. Some guys refused their shots, but most of the guys on my unit took their shots. It ran through Vacaville with no mercy. I know of a few men dying.</br></br>

We were locked in the cell a lot of the time. We get fed in our cells. For a long time there was no program but slowly that is coming back. Mail was backed up, I don't have anyone to write to out there. I've been locked for 16 years, all of my friends and family have moved on.</br></br>

I don't have any kids so most of the visiting and stuff did not affect me. I wish I had someone to write to because life is very lonely. In 2018 I saved up a bunch of my pills and ate them. Two and a half days later I woke up on a breathing machine. I guess they saved my life. I'm still upset about that.</br></br>

Since then I got in touch with myself. I read the Bible all the time and I try to do the right thing to other people. I guess God was not ready for me. Now I think I'm going to heaven if there is one, if not I'm not hurting nothing by doing good for other people. The outside world forgets about us. We are people in here also.</br></br>

I commit a crime and I'm paying my debt to the world. But I am a good person with feelings also. I feel so alone but I'm not worthless. I have a lot to offer all of you people out there. I've never had a visit but the men in here that get them miss it a lot. To have family come and see you makes a difference.</br></br>

Thank you for your kind words. If you want to feel free to write again or have someone else write me again.
