This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Soledad.</br></br>

Up until about a week ago there were only about six COVID-19 positive prisoners placed in quarantine in the dorm area. And as of about a week ago, numerous prisoners testing positive for COVID-19 were placed in both the dorm and Rainer hall- B side under quarantine. Why the separation? I have no answer.</br></br>

Here is what has angered me about the way CTF officials have handled this COVID-19 epidemic. We are at CTF North, A-yard were the only facility/yard with no COVID-19 positive prisoners/staff. And that being the case this facility should of been filled to capacity and then placed on lockdown with no intake and left alone. Then if and when a COVID-19 prisoner arose, take measures to control and treat it.</br></br>

But due to staff and medical staff negligence, on November 21, 2020, Saturday, Lassen Hall, A and B side was placed on quarantine lockdown. Due to one prisoner on B-side testing positive for COVID-19. This prisoner in question was on regular taken to medical trips outside the prison and should of been placed in either Rainer Hall or the dorm under the 14-day quarantine policy.</br></br> 

Soon after six more prisoners tested positive and were placed in quarantine before Rainer Hall and the dorm. I have counted 25 prisoners who are under COVID-19 quarantine. And it's bullshit that CTF officials have been placed a low to no regard for my safety and health or wellbeing, and nothing is being done about it.
