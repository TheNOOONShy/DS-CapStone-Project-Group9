This story was told by a person incarcerated at New Folsom.</br></br>

UCI: How are you today?</br></br>

Caller: I’m alright, living.</br></br>

UCI: That’s good to hear. What facility are you currently housed at?</br></br>

Caller: I’m at California State Prison, Sacramento [unintelligible].</br></br>

UCI: Okay, and what has the COVID situation been like at your facility?</br></br>

Caller: [unintelligible].</br></br>

UCI: I’m sorry?</br></br>

Caller: Sorry, like my full address or just my cell number?</br></br>

UCI: No no no, what has the COVID situation been like at your facility, like how has the COVID been there?</br></br>

Caller: Oh, well right now, we on, they got us on quarantine because of the COVID. I guess somebody had contact with COVID but every like, two weeks we get on quarantine and they lock us down for two weeks.</br></br>

UCI: Mhm, and like, what else does that consist of? Like, social distancing and masks and things like that?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, they have us wearing masks but we don’t like them. Keep it honest, you know.  And they won’t tell us who got the COVID-19 when they do say somebody got it.</br></br>

UCI: And so, since people have been getting vaccinated now, like how has the vaccination situation been like at your facility?</br></br>

Caller: Well, me personally, I’m diagnosed with a low… immune system and I really don’t, can’t be around people, I guess, because of, because of the virus. But however, it’s, like, kind of hard when we deal with a bunch of people every day and the police only give us a minimum amount of hours outside of our cell. They only give us 15 minutes to shower and then a phone call and then we go right back in our cell, which sucks.</br></br>

UCI: And so, have they been offering the vaccine?</br></br>

Caller: Say again?</br></br>

UCI: Have they been offering the vaccine?</br></br>

Caller: Yes, they offered us the Pfizer vaccine and I took both shots.</br></br>

UCI: Oh, okay. So how have you been coping with the crisis?</br></br>

Caller: It’s not good. I’ve been trying to find a way that helps us get out of prison because of the virus. And you know, my family, some of them caught the virus. Some of my family caught the virus and it’s hard for them, for me to call them and so I can help them deal with that process. So it takes a toll on me but I try, you know, I try my hardest to just get through it day by day and take every chance I get.</br></br>

UCI: That’s right. And so, speaking of your family, like what has it been like for you to have reduced visitation and programming?</br></br>

Caller: It’s kinda hard because I got a few people that wanna come see me and being that they only give them like once a month. You know, it’s kinda hard because different people wanna come see me and they’re all not on the same visit list. So, it’s kinda hard and it’s stressful.</br></br>

UCI: So, what do you think that, that your facility could do to make the situation better in regards to COVID-19?</br></br>

Caller: I think that they could open it back up and let us, let us have our visits and go to work and have normal programs because if somebody do get sick, they can just put them in a medical bed, you know?</br></br>

UCI: What else did you want the people to know about your experience?</br></br>

Caller: I want them to know that, you know, being in prison during this pandemic, you know, is kinda difficult for us. We wanna see our families, you know, and that they just allow us to go home.</br></br>

UCI: Yes, I understand that. Well, that’s all from me today. Thank you very much for participating in PrisonPandemic. Please consider telling your friends about us and seeing if they would like to call in.</br></br>

Caller: Alright, I will do that.</br></br>

UCI: Thank you. You have a good night.</br></br>

Caller: You too, man.</br></br>
