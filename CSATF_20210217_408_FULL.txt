Dear PrisonPandemic,</br></br>

I am 33 yrs. old. I am currently serving a sentence of 55 yrs. to life, and am incarcerated at Corcoran. I am including a short story of my experience during this COVID-19 pandemic. I would like to thank all of you volunteers for shedding light on our experiences.</br></br> 

It really means a lot to many people. If it is possible, I would be interested in correspondence with anyone willing to take the time to share our experiences though these rough time. I can receive e-mails through JPay.com or good ol’ fashioned “snail mail” will do :). I will include my info at the bottom of letter. Thank you all for your time once again, and may God bless you. Have a great day.</br></br> 

Sincerely,</br></br>

“My Pandemic Experience”</br></br>

Life in prison is hard enough to begin with, throw in the added stress of a global pandemic, and it could begin to feel unbearable. My, and many other individual’s, experience has been difficult this past year. Normal routines have changed drastically and programs has diminished.</br></br>

Small comforts such as seeing our families and loved ones have been taken away. We have had to find new and creative ways to cope with our situation. In these uncertain times it’s hard not to wonder, whether today or tomorrow may be my last day of full health.</br></br>

During this time of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have been placed on what is called “modified program.” This means that our regular program schedule is affected. With the amount of yard and dayroom time we receive being reduced by about half.</br></br>

We are supposed to get 2 and a half hours of yard every day, when we are on “normal program.” But we usually end up getting about one hour and a half. That’s as long as we are not on “fog watch,” “short on staff,” or any other common excuse that we get now we get one hour and a half every other day, if we are lucky and they run program like they’re supposed to.</br></br>

There are eight buildings on this yard, before the pandemic two buildings used to go out to yard together. It is now one building at a time per yard schedule. Each building, or “block,” is divided into three sections; A, B, and C section, there are two tiers in each section. Under normal programs, each section would get one hour of dayroom, both top and bottom tiers at the same time.</br></br>

Now we have been coming out split tier program for dayroom, with the lower tier coming out for half an hour, and the upper tier coming out separately for their own half hour. Anytime we come out of our cells, whether for program or to go to medial we are required to wear face masks.</br></br> 

I never thought I would experience something like this in my life. The severity of the situation didn’t really set in until the correctional officers (CO’s) started passing out face masks one day. These face masks were made out of old prison clothing, pretty much just a layer of cloth with elastic bands. We had to use the same masks for about three to four months without them being replaced.</br></br>

Of course there is some concern about how effective they were in preventing the spread of Corona virus. Especially, since many people in various prisons throughout the state of California have gotten sick, with some even losing their lives. The prison I am housed at, SATF-Corcoran, has had a few mass outbreaks.</br></br>

In fact, there has been a little more than 6,000 cases of COVID-19 between three prisons (SATFC, Corcoran S.P., and Avenal S.P), about 30 min. away from each other. It is hard not to worry or feel some form of anxiety being in this situation. We are fortunate that we have not had a mass outbreak on the yard I am housed in.</br></br>

As far as I know, only two or three inmates have tested positive on this yard. But quite a few C.O.’s and free staff (contracted workers) have tested positive for COVID-19. If anyone is responsible for the spread of the virus into facilities, it is them. Because they go home every day and come back to work, while we stay here.</br></br>

I, myself, had to be quarantined for two weeks; because I was “Exposed” to COVID-19 through a free staff (physical therapist). She was asymptomatic and did not know she was positive for COVID-19, so she was still seeing patients. Since I came in contact with her during a physical therapy session, the facility took “precautionary measures,” and had me quarantined. Which means I had to pack all of my personal property and move to another block for two weeks.</br></br>

Even though it had been about a week and a half to two weeks since my last physical therapy session. The most interesting part of it all, is that I was in a cell with my celly for close to two weeks, yet they only quarantined me. Which doesn’t make sense, because if I was exposed, and had indeed been positive, that means I would have also exposed my celly. I wasn’t even tested for COVID-19 until after I had been in quarantine for about a week and a half, thankfully the results came back negative.</br></br>

No one would’ve ever imagined that visiting would come to a complete stop due to a pandemic. Being able to visit with our loved ones and friends allows us to maintain ties to society. Not to mention the comfort and peace of mind they bring, with the knowledge of not being alone throughout this period of confinement which we are currently subjected to. For those of us who don’t get visits very often, a rare opportunity to get a visit may have passed us by.</br></br>

It might be a while after the pandemic when we could see our loved ones again. Since distance and other circumstances, such as conflict in scheduling, make it difficult for out family and friends to come visit us. The pandemic is just one more obstacle that gets in the way. Hopefully they resume in person visiting soon, it would be nice to hug and kiss our loved ones again. Especially those of us who have kids, not only do they comfort us, but we comfort them as well.</br></br> 

Having a daily routine and a good program are conducive to dealing with life in prison in a positive manner. Programs such as school (G.E.D., high school, college courses), self-help groups, and vocational training, give one in prison a sense of purpose and accomplishment. But, due to COVID-19, the education department has been closed down and self-help groups have stopped running.</br></br> 

When we were on normal program, those of us taking college courses could go to school every day, those who are enrolled in either the high school or G.E.D. program would go about once or twice a week, and the computer vocation students were required to attend every day, Monday through Friday. As for the self-help groups, they used to run a different one almost every week night, Groups such as, A.A., N.A., GOGI, and Criminal Gangs Anonymous (CGA), etc. By completing a certain amount of hours in these self-help groups, we are able to earn certificates. In some cases earning these certificates are court ordered, or required by the parole board in order for us to earn our release.</br></br> 

We can also earn “milestone credits,” or good time conduct credits, upon completion of certain educational programs. Which allows us to get some time taken off of sentence. I am very grateful that the college program here is through correspondence courses and can be done from our cells. This has helped since we are in a pandemic and cannot attend class.</br></br>

I was able to complete my last courses and earn my A.A. degree in Liberal Arts, with an emphasis on Sociology from Feather River Community College because of this. I really enjoy reading and studying, they are some of my coping strategies. A means of mental escape that makes me feel alive, like I’m progressing and not staying stagnant, or frozen in time.</br></br>

Another one of my coping mechanism is exercising, it is a good means of stress relief and staying healthy. Which is very important especially in these uncertain times we are in. During this pandemic I have also started writing more, I have always enjoyed it, but I have been focusing more on it lately. It has allowed me to express myself and to look at things from a different perspective upon reading my work.</br></br>

Despite the many adjustments and uncertainties we have faced, we now seem to have a better understanding of how to navigate this pandemic than when it first began. For instance, the C.O.’s (correctional officers) recently passed out N95 face masks, in place of the cloth ones we received to begin with. They have also started a video visiting program since it has been nearly a year since the last time many of us has seen our families, and in most cases, longer.</br></br>

At the same time, I cannot claim that this experience has been completely negative, or all bad. One example that stands out to me happened right before the holidays. All of the inmates at this prison received a small care package (containing snacks, a couple hygiene items, stationary, and various resource info.) from Mount Tamalpais College in San Quentin, CA – I jokingly told my celly, “that small act of kindness reinstated my hope in humanity.” It really goes to show that there are good people out there that still see us as the human beings that we are. This means a lot being in the situation we are in (incarerated), through these uncertain times.</br></br>
