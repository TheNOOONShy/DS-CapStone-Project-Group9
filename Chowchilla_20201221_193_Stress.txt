Since the Pandemic times here have gotten harder with staff and inmates alike due to staff having to work more. Inmates needs are being neglected more and the abuse towards inmates is at its peak mentally, emotionally, and physically. Inmates are harming each other out of frustration of our needs not being met from not getting proper medical treatment, racial discrimination of equality, health, and safety standards from our food to disinfectants we need.</br></br>

To protect us from contracting the virus being forced to house with incompatible inmates. Staff been aware of this, leaving us to face hostile situations. Staff are leaving inmates to eliminate ourselves instead of doing their job they are sworn to do keeping the community safe.
