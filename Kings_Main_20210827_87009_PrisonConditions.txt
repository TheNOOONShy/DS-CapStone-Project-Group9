This story was told by a person incarcerated at Kings County Jail.</br></br>

Caller: They should be giving vaccine shots. They should be offering them. You have people -- because this jail right here's very small. You have people on the day room floor. And that's overcrowding because you've got an epidemic going.</br></br>

Why do you have it crowded? Yeah. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten people on -- welcome out here on the day room, including they come out of the cells. So, you're overcrowding people.</br></br>

If this pandemic's still going, on and it feels like you're supposed to have masks, supposed to act like your distanced, and because it's -- because people don't come here and look and see what's going on. People don't know.</br></br>

People don't know because they don't see us locked down. And it's not really known. It's kind of under the radar.</br></br> 
But a person could come here and make people admit that they're not the right way. A person would see that things are going are going on that shouldn't happen.</br></br>

That's actually -- technically, it's wrong of people to have people out here on a day room bunk. You know, it [unintelligible] finally releasing people because they're overcrowding people in jail. It's overcrowded.</br></br>

If you're sick in here, you can't get the proper medical attention in here because they don't have the -- they don't have the -- this facility right here doesn't offer the proper health care nor -- nor mental health care that we need.</br></br>

You have 600 to 700 inmates, yeah, 600 to 700 inmates that are in this facility, men and women. And you do not -- you have two mental health workers, and one of them is the head doctor. She hardly -- she doesn't see anyone.</br></br>

It's only the male doctor that sees anybody. His name is [redacted]. Oh, I'm sorry. So, he sits there, and he's like the only one that sees people.</br></br> 

But you've got 600 to 700 people you've got to see, and you've only got two people, or one person, throughout the whole week? And only one mental health person is throughout the weekend that's on call. And they're only seeing a handful of people.</br></br>

Out of -- he's seeing ten or 12 people. And it's 600 to 700 people here at the jail.</br></br>
