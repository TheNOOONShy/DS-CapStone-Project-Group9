This story was told by a person incarcerated at New Folsom.</br></br>

Caller: The main thing is that here at state prison, the pandemic issue basically has not been taken that serious. The unit that they had as a medical facility for the COVID testing and stuff, they have shut that down, and now it’s being used as a facility, training facility for the COs to go down there and train, which they shut down our program and everything.</br></br>

They’re no longer providing, you know, they don’t pass out disinfectant for inmates to clean themselves and to be sanitized, and clean and everything. The spray bottle we had for the phone is no longer out here. They don’t take everything seriously.</br></br> 

Inmates are walking around without masks on in the dayroom and the kitchen. The people, the inmates, that are serving our food and stuff, they wear a mask that is up under their chin.
