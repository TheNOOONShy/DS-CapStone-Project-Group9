<em>This story was told by a person incarcerated at San Joaquin County Jail.</br></br></em>

Caller: We got a really good captain here on my yard. Very hands-on. And he took one of his workers and they were spraying, like, every area that they're – you have a line, you know, like, say, to go in the chow hall – obviously we call it the chow, but it's called the cafeteria to you – or like the canteen line where you go and purchase store goods, and then, like, the medical line where you go, you know, get your, you know, like your medication, you stand in line, whatever. They were spraying Xs for us and orange Xs, like, every six feet.</br></br> 

And then, I mean, he – they were, like, 50, 60 yard long these, you know, these Xs. You know, not the size of them, but the length, really, really – how shall I say – signifying social distancing. This is where you will stand when these lines are in place. 

UCI: Sure.</br></br>

Caller: And then the masks – then the masks came. Obviously, they handed out three masks per inmate. That was a – that was a sign, obviously. And then we just had the cloth ones at first. And then, I guess, they stepped up the game and they got us the N95s.</br></br>

UCI: Oh, you did I never heard that.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, everyone's required. If they see you without an N95, you are – you will be approached; you know? Which is good, obviously. You know, I'm even wearing mine right now talking in the phone.</br></br>

UCI: Oh, you sound great.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, you can only imagine how many people, you know, I mean, look what I'm holding. How many people use this – we got three phones, but still; you know? And I got me a hand sanitizer pump in my cell, small one, so I can keep, you know, I'm on it.
