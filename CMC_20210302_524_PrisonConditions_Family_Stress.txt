This letter was written by a person incarcerated at CMC (California Men’s Colony).</br></br>Having COVID in prison to me is like having AIDS, Ebola and being bullied. Everything is hopeless, lockdowns, it’s like being in the “shu” solitary confinement, it’s like being with a disease being screamed at, constantly yelled and sodomized, raped, plunder, and reprisal against because of COVID. You get bullied for COVID.</br></br>Having no visits breaks me, having no visits makes me not believe in God anymore! It makes me feel like the government, prisonscrats are God or the devil enforcers. I’ve had 10 deaths and aware of 15 deaths of family and friends from COVID, other complications! And I don’t watch nothing related to God or the word anymore cause it’s like the state, government are hypocrites, we can’t complain, don’t have luxury of protest or grievance without reprisals! Nobody cares about my life!</br></br>I had complications, my leg ballooned up at night when I had COVID, it swoll up 10 times its size. I had thumping temple head throbs, rolling chills, no taste, no smell sense for 60 days. No meds but water! Everybody irritable, nobody cares it’s a job everybody hates but will take out their hostility on a grown ass prisoner cause your problems become mines with direct orders.</br></br>They government or prisoncrats didn’t go to a Trump rally forcing masks, or COVID restrictions or to sturgis motorcycle rally. But a prisoner gets disrespected even when I’m humble, respectful and non-disruptive. Cause of COVID it’d be a guard that pissed over his own crap but will go bananas on you for not standing in front of building when it’s yard recall. I’m walking to the building. WTF, why are you bothering? I just got off work, I work through pandemic and I ain’t being violent, disruptive, or disrespectful. I got pulled over cause I didn’t stand in front of building which some good ole boy prisoners do! I’ve not seen a memo from captain or warden stating all prisoners who work shall stand in front of building coming from work due to COVID!</br></br>Some prison guards balk social distance so which one is it? You can stand in front if officers don’t let you in why do I’ve to stand in front of building? Pre-COVID, it wasn’t all the unnecessary nonsense like we don’t have stress. We got problems too! If we’re having a bad year we better not allow it to surface. We gotta be obedient our entire time incarcerated with COVID, with deaths, with no visits, just mean ass guards that turn prison into hell on earth for what? Cause of COVID? We didn’t smuggle in COVID? We didn’t email the pandemic or start riot-COVID. We didn’t COVID assault anyone but I got infected and grateful I didn’t die but I felt like I would. I’ve thyroid ailments and high blood pressure.
