This story was told by a person incarcerated at San Quentin.</br></br>

Caller: When I paroled in July of this year, July 13th, was when they actually physically let me go, there were close to somewhere around 1500 cases.</br></br>

And within 10 days, it was almost two and a half thousand, like another 1000 cases. And they were dropping the prison population. And they were sending people like me who had gotten sick, who tested positive, who was still sick out into quarantine, under this Project Hope program that Newsom was doing.</br></br>

So I ended up nine days in quarantine at a Travelodge. And just before that I'd spent 17 days in quarantine at San Quentin with another week before that knowing that I was sick, but them saying “oh you probably don't have it.” They came to my cell with my- with two of us in a cell and they say to my cellie, “you're- you tested positive.”</br></br>

He says, “I’m not sick. I have no symptoms.” I looked at the guard and said “we're locked in because we can't- this modified program.” And I said, “What about me? I'm feeling like hell.”</br></br>

And he said, “Nope. My clipboard- nope, you’re not on here.” But we tested the exact same day. So, and it wasn't till a week later that they admitted to me, “[redacted] man, you got it. Dude, you have it.”</br></br>

Meanwhile, I've been sick for a week, and I had to go what they call man down. So, there's a clinic, there's an emergency. And the only way to get to the emergency is if you do- you call- it's a command it’s to the guards “I'm going man down. I'm sick as hell and I'm going to fall down on the floor. So take me immediately to emergency.”</br></br>

So they did, and I was suffering from the worst nausea I've ever had in my life, chills, aches, pains, but no congestion and no fever. That's the weird thing. No taste, the loss of taste, loss of smell.</br></br>

Everything tasted like gasoline- would smell. I mean, I couldn't even drink cold water. Fatigue, couldn't eat, I lost probably 12, 15 pounds, which is probably a good thing.</br></br>

It's a hell of a way to lose weight. But I'm telling you, I did. And so they they took us out of our housing unit and split up all the cellies, they put us in different cells.</br></br>

And I was 17 days- they put us in a place called South block in badger section, B section, which is badger section, which they usually use for reception: guys coming out of jail, sit in these cells until they're classified to go to their final destination to do their time. So it's transient, and nobody cleans it. And there's white supremacist graffiti all over the walls and swastikas and the thing’s dirty and the mattresses are nasty, and they weren't giving us any soap or towels or anything for a few days.</br></br>

And we were getting food but it was brought on trays from the chow hall that was cold. And finally the- all the inmates get locked down, so there's nobody to cook the food because the free staff is not going to do it. And then the free staff fell to COVID, so they couldn't come in.</br></br>

So then it's the guards that have to do it- mind that at one point we were getting three three bag lunches a day, which is either state bologna and bread and an apple. Well apple’s good, but- and water from the- I mean, that's basically what it is three times- or peanut butter. So it's food, and you're getting calories, but there's like no vegetables, there's no there's no meats, there's no I mean, you don't want eat to bologna and- no, this is bad stuff.</br></br>

We don't know what's in it. Peanut butter isn’t bad, you know, for that kind of stuff. But you get enough of it, and eat three times a day or whatever and, and you're in cell by yourself on the bunk boom, because the cells are tiny.</br></br>

So eventually the- within a week, the- the plant operations engineers came through to start putting power to the cells because the guys have little chargers and things to- for batteries, for CD players, to listen to radio. There was no TV, there was no nothing. And a lot of guys, a lot of us, you got to have a TV, that's how you see the world.</br></br>

Otherwise, you got concrete walls, and the cells are tiny. The cells are four and a half feet wide by 10 feet. And you got two guys in there, and it's rough.</br></br>

But this was just single cell, which I understand now that they've started moving people back. The viruses burn through, there's less cases, so a lot of guys are now still single cells. They gutted the chapels, they pulled all the pews out of the Catholic chapel, all the benches are out and the seats and everything, and they took all the churches apart and made them bed for COVID.</br></br>

They did the same thing to PIA, which is the Prison Industry Authority. That's the mattress factory and the furnish factory that guys are work in, they gutted the whole thing in space for beds. The gym, which was for recreation.</br></br>

They set up tents on the lower yard that look like field hospital tents, big ones big like- put guys in there, just so they can spread people out because they've known for years that this is- there's no way for social distancing. I mean, you can't even keep a social distance from your cellmate or your cellie or cell next door. If you go to the bars, there's bars, there's not doors, and that thing is bars it’s wide open out into- And you got a guy you could- if you could, you could just reach around and grab his hand, let alone be socially distanced from a guy in your cell.</br></br>

So if he's got it and you don't, well, you're there- you're quarantined with him. It's- it's San Quentin was built for single cell. It was built for like a maximum of a couple of thousand.</br></br>

And when I got there in 2010, there was over 6,000 people. They had people in the gym, they had people triple bunk. Well, once they get away with it long enough to have two guys in a cell, that's- they welded the bunks in.</br></br>

They have two guys in a cell that was built for one. That's it- that becomes normal. Do that for a decade and it's well, it's just what we do.</br></br>

Well, it's unhealthy and it's- it's wrong. But that was kind of a digression from the COVID but that was absolutely what made it spread like wildfire. And people were washing, they were giving us little bottles of sanitizer thing, but not much.</br></br>

And once we hit quarantine, it was basically “good luck.” The doctor might come by, you know. The nurses did come by every day, and they check temperature with a gun, and they'd have to go there and they, you know- and they would check your- your blood oxygen by putting the thing on your finger. So I mean, there was that.</br></br>

They did- medical was doing everything they felt they could do- that everything that custody would let them do. But- and they're saying “you gotta get these guys out of here.” And custody is saying “sorry, we-” now they never have there- there's nothing to- as precedent to tell them how to operate, to tell them how to do this.</br></br>

So they were making decisions by the hour. And you had guys from death row, I heard- I was- when I was in the clinic. I heard the nurses talking and saying, “Yeah, a couple of guys came in from death row, one of them was saying he didn't want any treatment for COVID.</br></br>

"It's my way out of here.” So what is that: suicide by COVID? And the nurse and the doctor that were talking, just talking, chatting about it, we're saying, “Man, that's terrible.” While the guards are saying, “well, that's what happens, oh, well,” until some of their numbers started to die, too.</br></br>

So I don't know what the total number is at this point, but I know that it's more than 25 that we've lost. And most of them have been inmates, but there have been a few guards, a sergeant. And it's a shame, these guys didn't have to go like that.</br></br>

But prison is hard on health anyway. And if you don't eat well, or you don't stay active, or whatever, you put yourself in a compromised position. It was the worst disease that I've ever encountered, I wouldn't wish it on anybody.
