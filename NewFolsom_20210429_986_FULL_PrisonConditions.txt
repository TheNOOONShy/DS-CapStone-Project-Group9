Now PrisonPandemic,</br></br>

I recently received your note concern the project. Well to be honest I don't really have time to participate in a study. But I will share a little of my own experience inside dealing with the COVID-19 protocols.</br></br>

Now myself and most of the other prisoners here have already been vaccinated. But these people, administration here, have been playing a non-stop game with placing us on quarantine every other week or so.</br></br>

They let us up then place us right back down again! Which makes no real sense if the overall majority of the population has been vaccinated. It's just becoming a game for them to get out of doing work!</br></br>

Plus personally, I was supposed to be let out on elder parole, prop 57, but I was denied during the pandemic. When they were supposed to be making room according to a federal court order! These people administration here, fill themselves about the laws and fly right in the face of justice!</br></br>

Respectfully in solidarity.
