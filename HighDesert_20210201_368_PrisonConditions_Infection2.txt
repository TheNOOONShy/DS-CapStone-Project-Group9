This letter was written by a person incarcerated at High Desert.</br></br>

The building I was moved to housed all the positive and sick people. For those who are not sick but tested positive, they became sick once they were housed with sick people. For some reason my new cell came with freezing temperature and bad plumbing. It was constantly flooded with gray water.</br></br>

After 30 days I was returned to my housing unit. Nothing has changed. We are still not allowed out of our cells other than for showers, which I still don’t go out for, I birdbath in my cell. I lost track of the count but I know it’s been over 60 days. The holidays have passed while we’ve been confined to ourselves. My birthday is in two days.
