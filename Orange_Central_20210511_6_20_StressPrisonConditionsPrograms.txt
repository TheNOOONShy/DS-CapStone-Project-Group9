<em>This story was told by a person incarcerated at Orange County Central Men's Jail.</br></br></em>

UCI: So what facility are you currently housed at?</br></br>

Caller: Orange County Men’s Jail.</br></br>

UCI: Okay, and what has the COVID situation been like at your facility?</br></br>

Caller: Not friendly.</br></br>

UCI: How so?</br></br>

Caller: Deputies are pretty mean. We’re not convicted, we’re still awaiting trial and it feels like they don’t care about any of us in here.</br></br> 

UCI: And then in terms of programs and just daily life in prison, how has COVID-19 affected all of that?</br></br>

Caller: We don't have any programs here, they’ve stopped everything. We don't even have a Chapel.</br></br> 

UCI: And what has it been like for you to have reduced visitation or any at all and programming?</br></br>

Caller: Very depressing. Lots of anxiety. Poor health conditions.</br></br>

UCI: And how have you been coping with the crisis?</br></br>

Caller: Just trying to read and draw and that’s about it. We don’t even get, I haven't had sunshine in at least a year and a half.</br></br>

UCI: And given what you have said, what do you think would have made the situation at your facility better?</br></br>

Caller: Being able to go outside.</br></br>

UCI: So in, so are incarcerated folks at your facility not allowed to go outside at all and just confined to like inside the building?</br></br>

Caller: Inside the building yes, only.</br></br> 

UCI: Are there any other activities being offered?</br></br>

Caller: No.
