This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Jamestown.</br></br>

To who it may concern,</br></br>

This is a summary of 2020 into 21 of my experiences during COVID and the effects it has had thus far. I have be in prison for 13 years now and it has never been a pleasant place, but the pandemic has taken a drastic toll.</br></br>

Any and everyone who is in, or has someone imprisoned during this time has been kept from their family and friends. Has been subjected to disciplinary treatment and had it labeled as a condition stipulated by medical.</br></br> 

CDCR has basically used COVID as a warrant to do what they want. Administration pushing it off as medical and medical back onto administration. I have been stationed at a fire camp since 2019 and, at the beginning of the year 2020, I went out for court to see if I qualified for an early release.</br></br>

I did a layover at a prison reception awaiting next-day transfer and got quarantined due to a mumps outbreak there. That led directly into a COVID quarantine. What was to take a day turned into months in which I was returned to my camp and not only did I not get an early release, was also given additional time for going out when summoned.</br></br> 

I’ve been quarantined three times until I finally got back to my camp. From there, I went about my duties as the pandemic continue dto take a toll on our state. Bringing about new structures to adhere to.</br></br> 

Months later I suffered a facial injury and had to be hospitalized. The camps have no medical staff and if an inmate is in need of medical attention, which is often, they must leave. Our [Unintelligible] of Jamestown was dealing with a COVID outbreak and wasn’t allowing anyone in so those in need had to be housed in prisons, placed in cells with nothing awaiting treatment and clearance for transfer.</br></br> 

I underwent such a time. For four months I was in Soledad prison, that had its own outbreak that had occurred prior to me arriving. Due to this, in overcrowding of inmates and understaffing the attention to individual cases was poor.</br></br>

I was housed in central Y-wing with inmates who are not supposed to be housed in the same building, such as GPs & SNYs, level one, two, and three. Yet it still happened. I was to be taken to a hospital for surgery by no later than a week from the initial injury and to receive treatment within two weeks of it happening. Instead I was neglected and my bones set out of place.</br></br>

The medical at Soledad thought that I went out and even reset my quarantine time due to this belief. Anyone who left the facility was to be quarantined for two weeks. Once verified by transportation that I had not left and was in a cell for 17 days, then I was placed in a dorm on South yard and was quarantined again due to an outbreak in that dorm.</br></br> 

Throughout my time in so many quarantines in Soledad, I saw and was constantly neglected. Placed in dangerous situations that was clear health risks, such as the upkeep of cleanliness and handling of food. Stress of being denied phone calls and visits. I have been constantly overlooked for early release even though I suffered a major injury! All over technicalities.</br></br> 

I am considered a violent offender because of robbery, yet no one was physically harmed in my case. I have been denied ACP (ankle monitor) due to this and MCRP (living facility) because the program is not in my county.</br></br> 

I am still in need of a surgery to put my eye back in place to restore my vision. I was well on my way to becoming a firefighter upon parole. But now my course has been altered and I can't get the help I am in need of because of my crime and lack of care.</br></br> 

The people have written us off for the most part. We watch the news daily. It is our only connection to the outside world. And as much as people are hurting out there we aren’t even more in here. Prison heightens everything!</br></br> 

And now with COVID it is even worse!! I am on quarantine as I write this. I am currently trying to make my way back to camp. But due to the constant complications, we are delayed time and time again. </br></br>

I have went 10 years without serious infraction. I have been working for the community and earning my way back into society. But all of that is overlooked in the midst of COVID. We as violent offender should be looked at on a case by case.</br></br> 

I am within six months of release. I have worked hard to go from a max 4 yard to a low-custody camp. I would not be a burden on my community, and that I would be an asset. And there are others like me. Cases where no one has been physically harmed. Prisoners who are close to release. </br></br>

I have a family. A mother in her 60s and grandmother close to 90. A wife. And they need me more than ever!!! I have not seen my mother in two years and my grandmother in at least seven.</br></br>

People are dying by the thousands, and we are left in here. I have been in here since I was 18 years old. I just turned 31 in December. And I looked forward to making something of myself. Of coming home and taking what I have worked hard to achieve and help my family.</br></br> 

I spent 2020 questioning if I would make it out of here alive. By the grace of God I have not contracted COVID. But many have and many have not made it. I hope that my account can do some good and help you. And I pray that this finds you in good health.</br></br>

Well wishes.
