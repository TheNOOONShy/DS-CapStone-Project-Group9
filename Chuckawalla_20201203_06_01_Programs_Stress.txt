This story was told by a person incarcerated at Chuckwalla Valley State Prison.</br></br>

UCI: So, what has it been like for you to have reduced visitation and programming?</br></br>

Caller: It’s terrible. It’s terrible. The programming is really off. There’s a limited yard, limited out programs, and you know, it’s just like I said. I personally don’t feel that it’s prison. I personally feel it’s a concentration camp kind of situation.</br></br>

UCI: Okay. So, what have you been doing to be, to cope with the crisis?</br></br> 

Caller: Just following the masks, and the social distancing and constant washing of hands and eliminating myself to being in contact with others.</br></br>

UCI: And, what else do you want people to know about your experience?</br></br>

Caller: I honestly feel that CDC, CDCR should actually be written up through the, you know, the state and county health departments individually on how they’re treating the COVID epidemic and what measurements they need to take for, for fighting, you know, this virus and what are the next steps on, for the vaccines.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm. And I know that you said you had gone through some of the symptoms. So I’m done with all my questions. So if you wanted to talk about that or anything else, the rest of it you, it's your time.</br></br>

Caller: Okay. Well, I guess I pretty much gave you all the information.</br></br> 

But like I said, I really feel that, you know, there needs to be - I feel the medical staff here actually needs to be trained from health department staff on how to treat the COVID, not just by guessing game of issuing certain medications and moving prisoners around from one housing unit to another housing unit just so they could - I kind of feel they’re being in the interest of some type of financial funding for treating us for COVID epidemic.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>

I think they should actually, you know, certain facilities individually should be overlooked by professionals and other people who can really show and teach medical what needs to be done here.</br></br>

UCI: Right.
