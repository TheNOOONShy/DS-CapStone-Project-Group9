This story was told by a person incarcerated at Los Angeles County Men's Central Jail.</br></br>

UCI: And so, how has the COVID situation been like at the facility that you're in right now?</br></br>

Caller: It's crazy. They brought me back down - they brought me from upstate. And when I first -  I got here - I got here August. And, you know, every time you leave the facility they test you twice before you leave, anywhere.</br></br> 


So, they tested once at the prison I was at, and they tested me the day before I left the prison - that was all negative - and then, eight hours later when I got here they tested me again, and all of sudden they said I was – and it went from negative eight hours prior to positive. So, then they stuck me in quarantine again for two weeks. And other than that, it just kind of sucks.</br></br>

UCI: So, how has the vaccination situation been like at your facility?</br></br>

Caller: They offer them. I mean, I got mine last - on the 13th. They offer them. They come through every week or something. One of the doctors will come through and ask if you've had it. If you haven't they give you the opportunity to take it if you want it.</br></br>

UCI: And you know how you said that when they switched you from facility, like eight hours later, you suddenly were positive? Did you know if there were any other people that tested positive as well?</br></br>

Caller: Well, that's what they tried to tell me. They tried to say that, yo know, somebody that I either came in with, or I was around somebody that tested positive. But they never gave me any test results. They never gave me any paperwork. They never gave me anything. And I requested it.</br></br>

UCI: So, they just told you that you were positive and then just put you – okay.</br></br>

Caller: They just told. Yes, they just told me and I had to go on faith that they were not lying, you know? And I filled out grievances. I filled out paperwork trying to get test results and sergeants and everything and they just denied me. They wouldn't give it to me.</br></br>

UCI: Has this happened to other people too that you've heard of? Like that they just don't have access?</br></br>

Caller: Yes. It happened to everybody in that module. Or everybody that they said were positive and quarantined. We all asked for some kind of paperwork saying that we were positive, you know, something, showing us why we were there.</br></br>

And they just told us, oh, no, the doctor just tells you that you're positive or negative. You know, like what the fuck? That doesn't make sense.</br></br>

UCI: Right. And so, how was that being quarantined? Did they separate you, or how were you able to –</br></br>

Caller: Yeah. The ones that were supposedly positive, they stuck us all in [redacted], and they left us there for they said anywhere from 10 to 14 days. I was there for 12 or 13. And they come every day, every morning after breakfast, and they hit you with your vitals, make sure you're alright.</br></br>

Then they come back after lunch and do it again. And if you don't show no signs or anything for those 12 days, or however long you're there, then they'll clear you and then they'll send you out to wherever you're going.</br></br>

UCI: Mhmm. And do they retest you again? Or do they just after a certain amount of time they just let you go?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, once you start showing symptoms, or if you have a fever, or anything, I think they test you. But yeah, actually they didn't test - they didn't test us at all until - actually they didn't test us again at all.</br></br>

UCI: Mhmm. Oh, interesting.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, that was kind of weird. Upstate in prison you had to test three times before you got out of quarantine.</br></br>

UCI: Mhmm. And so, since you've been, you know, in during COVID, how have you coped with it? Like do you think it's different, do you think it's weird? Like how have you kind of dealt with it, especially being alone for those few days?</br></br>

Caller: And that's the other thing. You know, you're supposed to be alone, but I had a celly.</br></br>

UCI: Oh, I see.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, but I mean - but it's to be expected, I guess, if you're being in quarantine, you know? 

UCI: And, so?</br></br>

Caller: They let us come out every other day to shower. And that was it.</br></br>

UCI: And so, what do you think would have made the situation better at your facility when this happened, when all of you were quarantined?</br></br>

Caller: I don't know. Nothing.</br></br>

UCI: Yes, it was kind of the best that they could have done. But that does suck that they just didn't give you your results or anything like that. That's kind of annoying.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah - yeah, because I know for a fact I just tested for it - I just tested for it eight hours prior to that and it was negative. You know, what, just from a bus ride down here all of a sudden?</br></br> 

UCI: Yeah, that's crazy.</br></br>

Caller: And they wouldn't give me my results. That was irritating.</br></br>

UCI: Mhmm. And so, is there anything else you would want people to know about your experience with COVID?</br></br>

Caller: No. COVID sucks.</br></br>

UCI: I'll agree with that. But thank you very much for participating in PrisonPandemic. Please consider telling your friends about us and seeing if they would like to call in. Your story was really insightful to let us know how it really is, especially that part where you mentioned that they just didn't tell you your results. It's questionable.</br></br>

Caller: Yes, how do I know if I was sick or not. You know what I mean?</br></br>

UCI: Yes. Like they can tell you that, but it's different when you actually see it. You're like, oh, okay.</br></br>

Caller: Yes, exactly. And then you know something, I was talking to my family the other day and they were telling me, something like, when you test positive they're supposed to wait like 90 days or whatever before you can get the vaccination?</br></br>

UCI: Yeah. I think that's a thing where you have to wait a bit, yeah.</br></br>

Caller: Okay, look I got here, They came and gave me my vaccine September 13th. And I tested positive, you know what I mean? You're supposed to wait 90 days. So, I don't know.</br></br>

UCI: Yes. And so, how has COVID affected you being in contact with your family?</br></br>

Caller: Well, not very much. I mean, I don't really get visits anyways, but I call and I talk to them all the time.</br></br>

UCI: Right. That works, yeah.</br></br>

Caller: Yes, it doesn't really affect nothing.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah. All right, but once again thank you very much for participating in PrisonPandemic. And again, please consider telling your friends about us and seeing if they would like to call in. I hope you have a great night. Thank you for sharing your story.</br></br>

Caller: For sure. You have a good one.</br></br>

UCI: Thank you. You as well. Bye-bye.
