This story was told by a person incarcerated at Ventura County Main Jail.</br></br>

UCI: Okay, that's good. Then what do you think would make the situation at your facility better?</br></br>

Caller: Like honestly, they – they only give us so much like cleaner, like – like cleaning supplies, like all that stuff, you know? It’s like – it's all limited. Like maybe they can help us out with a little bit more, like what – you know what I mean?</br></br>

UCI: Yeah. How often do they give you like new masks or like new cleaner wipes?</br></br>

Caller: It’s all like once a day, all the cleaners, and it's only for like a short period of time. Like they bring all the cleaning stuff, but then they take it away. Then we get it again the next day for a little bit. It honest – I wish they had all that supplies out 24/7 so we could, you know?</br></br>

UCI: Yeah. Do they follow social distancing? Like do they keep six-feet apart from you guys or like from each other?</br></br>

Caller: Honestly, right now, as of like three months ago they haven't — like four months, five — like the last four months it – they honestly stopped doing all the distancing stuff. Like everybody is like more — it’s getting more packed in here. Like more people are coming in, and everybody just seems to be like just grouping.</br></br>

UCI: And how does that make you feel? Like do you feel like - like insecure, like unsafe?</br></br>

Caller: Honestly – honestly, I don't know how to take it. I don't – I don’t know. Like yeah they – I feel like they need to make a change though, or something, like go back to — I heard it's rising up again right now.</br></br> 

I don't know if it’s true. There’s only so much that I know about because I’m – I'm currently incarcerated, so I'm like pretty much locked down all the time.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah. Are you allowed visitation at all?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah. Yeah, I am. Honestly, I am. But it’s all – it’s through glass. It's not — it's not like you – no contact.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, that’s great. What else would you want people to know about your experience?</br></br>

Caller: What was that?</br></br>

UCI: I asked what else do you want people to know about your experience?</br></br>

Caller: Honestly – honestly, I don't know. I – I just – then I – hopefully, I just pray for everybody, honestly. I pray every night. I hope everybody just makes it through this.</br></br>

Honestly, in – in a situation like this, it’s kind of rough. It’s hard, especially right here. And I wish that anything – things could just get better, you know? I don't know how to say it.
