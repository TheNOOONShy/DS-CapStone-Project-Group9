Hello there, :)</br></br>

I received ur lil note + 2 my surprise I’m taking the time 2 respond 2 it . . . ? Hmmm . . . I gotta be depressed - :)</br></br>

In response 2 ur questions – how r things behind these prison walls? It’s rough 2 say the least + so far its only getting worse . . .</br></br>

Allow me 2 begin by stating – I’m currently doing a life sentence – I’m a juvenile lifer. I was 1 of the 1st juveniles 2 be tried + convicted as a adult + sent directly 2 level 4 adult prison in 96 – So yeah. 26 yrs - + I’ve been able 2 see the changes – </br></br>

Lately w/ this COVID – this year has been fun – at first – I honestly felt like the COVID-19 was B.S. – You know good ole Trump creating a diversion 2 keep the media focused on BS while our government did some underhanded dealings –</br></br> 

I say that because over here in “SATF” – it was business as usual no one doing the distancing – or wearing masks – that was “Hollywood” shit! :) There was no testing at the same time the whole world seemed to be under attack . . .</br></br>

The cold part is the prison started selecting rule changes 2 fuck w/ us – such as no masks yet but no playing sports + prison is 50% sports, soccer, handball, basketball + all the prison based tournaments where a street bum can shine :P these guys can’t hold down a job but can shoot a mean 3 pointer . . . plus no working out on the yard or dayrooms ??</br></br>

Still no types of testing . . . administration was creating a bunch of monsters phone hogs. No contact or behind glass visits w/ our families + girlfriends – a lot of good guys lost their ole ladies behind this crap – believe it or not but some people need + crave that human touch + it allows hope 2 continue 2 grow + w/out it.</br></br>
 
People out there look else where + the men stuck in prison r forced 2 internalize that pain + after a while – we tend to explode or most of us let that inner pain + confusion burn + smolder w/in us until we become a small pile of smelly ashes. We become depressed zombies that took 4 anything 2 self medicate the pain away. . . then there’s the few of us that know about the struggles + pain of solitary confinement . . . SHU Time – I’ve been a validated member of a disruptive group + did 6 years C facility Pelican Bay.</br></br>

So those few of us tend 2 stick 2gether . .  praying that they creators will continue 2 bless us w/ the strength 2 not give up all hope . . . it’s a survival of the fittest of who gets on the phones lately + the COs love it . . .</br></br> 

I lost my #1 supportive – my father – October 2020 so . . . I don’t even know the pain I’m dealing w/ . . . Please, I go 2 BPT. in 2021 – soon I almost made it home . . . my girlfriend is holding on by a thread – prolly won’t last. 10-?-20. This yard begin COVID testing + guess what. We all damn near have a had the shit . . .  apparently it’s hella rare 4 us to get sick tho ?? no where near like u see on TV . . . this D yd. has been flipped + we all moved around 2B quarantined ect, . . .</br></br> 

So now recently . . . our food has been cut down. No joke – went from 4 slices of bread – last yr . . 2 slices – now 4 month ago  3 saltine crackers = 6 small crackers – now 2 = 4 cracker w/ our state issue lunch. ??</br></br>

So – w/ that being said – I haven’t eaten touched bases on some of us – no longer receiving $4 canteen because our families/casinos are effected + our family struggle to pay rent-bills. So shit trickles down hill . . . I’m in D-2-SATF + there’s been 3 serious incidents where people lost hope + tried to take there own life :(. U would be surprised what a kind word can do 4 a guy who is on the edge – or a shot of coffee . . .</br></br> 

I’m a Native American + 1 of the lucky 1s who r able 2 get canteen + I try + share but shit is getting though behind these walls . . .</br></br>

Say a prayer 4 us all . . .</br></br>

Sincerely,</br></br>
