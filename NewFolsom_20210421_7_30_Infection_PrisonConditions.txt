This story was told by a person incarcerated at New Folsom.</br></br>Caller: As of right now, dealing with the COVID experience, right, I have three or four, actually I have about close to 10 underlying medical conditions, right.</br></br>And so basically what it was was when I refused to take the vaccine, due to my neutropenia condition, it tells me not to take the live vaccine or be around people that has taken a live vaccine due to that medical condition, right.</br></br>Now, about a week after that, after I refused, two days after I refused, then they tried to get the social worker to try to get me mentally unfit where they could try to force it over on me. And then the social worker cleared me and stated that I knew exactly what I was doing, and I showed her my medical paperwork.</br></br>So that was on the 19th, and so from the 26th of January, now all of a sudden, I got a positive COVID-19 test they claim. And they refused to get me a rapid test or they refused to get me another test and they want to put me in C8, which is the COVID-19 building.</br></br>And basically, I was trying to get them to put me in the infirmary because I told them that it was impossible because I have sarcoidosis pulmonary lung condition since 1992. I have an insufficient, a severe combined immunodeficiency with mild t cells and white blood cell disorder.</br></br>And I have asthma, COPD, leukopenia, neutropenia, and I have seven coronary conditions. So therefore, it would be impossible, medically impossible, for me to have a positive COVID-19 without having any symptoms.</br></br>Now, IÕve been writing to federal courts and IÕve been writing to prison law office and the health care receiver or the institution since they put us on the COVID-19 lockdown because of the fact that they were putting out memorandums and saying one thing, but everything was totally different.
