December 18th, 2020</br></br>Dear PrisonPandemic,</br></br>Hi everyone. I am currently incarcerated at Central California Women's Facility, better known as CCWF. I have been in prison for the last four years, with two more to go. I'm hoping by the time I parole, this pandemic will be under control so I can see my family members without social distancing or on a screen!</br></br>When the COVID hit here in March, it was very weird in the beginning. We were on complete lockdown for the first two days, which means our breakfast and dinners were brought to us and no movement. It was somehow like they had no idea what to do with all these women so they just did what was easiest for them.</br></br> 

After those first few days, we got put into a modified program schedule. They shut down all classes, all groups, all jobs. The back lot was empty. A first for that, CCWF shut down programming for the first time ever. Some of us were relieved because now we were basically on a break, while some of us are not too happy because they like to program.</br></br> 

To this day, we are still on a modified program. About a month and a half ago they opened up a few things, like every unit got night guard once every four days, school went back for one session only, and we were programming two wings at a time. We recently had a COVID outbreak, so everything got shut down and we got an even stricter modified program.</br></br>The COVID to me is a little hard to understand. We don't know what it is like out there. We are sequestered behind prison gates, we barely social distance, only wear the mask when absolutely necessary, and can live with up to eight girls in one room. We are the safest we can be which is quite funny because we are the ones in trouble and people on the streets are suffering and exposed.</br></br>

My safety inside here is like being in a bubble suit. The only way we can be exposed is by a staff testing positive which means whether they work in the units, the kitchen, the canteen, etc. everyone around them get quarantined. Currently five buildings are on quarantine, 505, 508, 513, 514, 515. Besides that, my safety is fantastic.</br></br>The only thing that sucks was having our visits taken away. I usually see my dad every three months or so. We had a visit in January then, COVID struck. About two weeks ago they finally set up video visits. </br></br> 

I finally got to see my dad 11 months later. It was nice. I got to see the new house, my cat, and my stepmom.</br></br> 

At least they gave us some way we can see our loved ones. I've been coping with this crisis by calling my family members to check on them, praying, and just putting positive vibes out into the universe.</br></br>Thank you for reading my story. I hope you all can find some insight into how us prisoners are affected and how we are dealing with it. I know that this pandemic has brought us all closer to one another, unifying us all.</br></br>  

Stay safe out there!</br></br> 

As always,</br></br>
