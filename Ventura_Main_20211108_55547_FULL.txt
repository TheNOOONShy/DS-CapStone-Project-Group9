This story was told by a person incarcerated at Ventura County Main Jail.</br></br>

UCI: Awesome. All right so you are free to begin. Did you have any stories?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah I was just, what?</br></br>

UCI: I can ask you questions.</br></br>

Caller: Well I mean, I mean I - this is, you ask questions and I'll -.</br></br>  

UCI: Yeah. I'll ask questions, and you can just tell me about your experience. So, what has the COVID situation been like at your facility?</br></br>

Caller: The COVID situation, I just barely got in, barely changed jails not too long ago, but I mean ain't nothing changed as far as them you know, other than our visits [unintelligible]. That's pretty much it. I mean, other than that, I mean, it's pretty much been the same here in the county jail.</br></br> 

I mean, things are just a little bit, they take a little longer. I mean, like medical treatment and mail. You know, visits, visits are through the, like a, like through the phone or just a regular visit window.</br></br>

UCI: And how about the vaccination situation? How has that been like at your facility?</br></br>

Caller: To be honest, I haven't caught COVID, and I never - I never took a vaccine. I clown around and tell people when they ask me, I'm like "No I don't need it, I'm good without it." They have — you can ask for it and get it if you want it. But myself, I don't feel like I don't need it.</br></br>

UCI: So they have been offering everyone the choice to take it, but you just decided to opt-out of it? Hello?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah.</br></br>

UCI: Yes, sorry. You cut out there. All right well -</br></br>

Caller: Sorry [unintelligible].</br></br>

UCI: So, you mentioned that— </br></br>

Caller: But if you want it, I mean like I told you, I heard you can go ahead and get it, huh?

UCI: I'm sorry, continue.</br></br>

Caller: No, I'm saying [unintelligible] been here, you know, through the whole [unintelligible], you know, and [unintelligible] probably have a [unintelligible]. Me personally, it was, you know, way different than [unintelligible] coming in [unintelligible].</br></br> 

The only thing that is different, like I said, is the mail takes a little longer, or visits are [unintelligible], but I'm pretty sure there's other — there are other guys in here that [unintelligible].</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, well, you can always — if you'd like, you can encourage others to call in as well to share their stories. That would be super helpful. But, I mean, if you have anything else to share, I'd love to hear it. If you've noticed, it has affected your family or your loved ones in any way or anyone else you are close to?</br></br>

Caller: You mean as far as being incarcerated or being out there with them when it happened?</br></br>

UCI: With the COVID. Like you said, you mentioned that visitation is slower, you said?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah. Just the process, I mean, [unintelligible], like first come, first serve now.</br></br>

UCI: Has that been hard on you and your family?</br></br>

Caller: To [unintelligible] on my side as far as to come visit me and stuff. I usually would have people come visit me and —</br></br>

UCI: I see.</br></br>

Caller: You know?

Caller: Like [unintelligible] I guess I’m getting no [unintelligible], you know.
