This story was told by an incarcerated individual at Mule Creek.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah. How have you been coping with the crisis?</br></br>

Caller: Me, I basically just work out, exercise, you know? Just to keep my spirit in. Read books and things like that. Really the main thing that helps me get through is me writing my music and trying to stay on the right path. So, when I get out of prison, I can be something in life, I could say, you know. Hopefully, my music career can take off and I can achieve the goals that I'm willing to perceive.</br></br>

UCI: That is amazing to hear. That's wonderful. Keep that up. It's just a little bit longer.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah. Because I'm an artist basically right now. I don't want to come back to jail, so I'm having to find something that I'm interested in doing, and just run with it basically, you know? Of course, I might have like a side job and all that. But there's no telling. You know, TikTok and these Instagrams and all that, want to just make it to where I want to be. I just keep faith and, you know, never give up on my dream, I could say.</br></br>

UCI: That is beautiful to hear. That is so great. I'm very happy for you.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, I appreciate it.</br></br>

UCI: Is there anything else you want people to know about your experience?</br></br>

Caller: That's pretty much everything I could really think of. That's like the main, you know, objective I could say. But other than that, I could say it's getting a little better. I just hope that COVID could just stay down to a low minimum, I could say that.</br></br> 

It don't come back the way it was and everybody, we locked in our cells again, a lot. And we got to keep getting scanned, like you know, to see if we got fevers and things like that. Or you know, just things that you got to do during the COVID. Keeping getting COVID tests. Putting a swab in our nose, it was just every week. It just, you know, got tiring after a while.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, I'm with you on that one. And what do you think would have made the situation at your facility better?</br></br>

Caller: What can make it better? Or may have been better?</br></br>

UCI: What would have made the situation better?</br></br>

Caller: I don't know. I could say them giving us second tests I could say. Like I know in certain situations like if somebody tests positive for COVID, or it's just like a, how can I explain it, like a test, but you're not really negative, but it's just like the test was like messed up, they won't give you a second test. They'll just send you down, you know, straight to quarantine.</br></br>

And I know certain people who didn't have COVID, and they're like, "Why can't I get another test?" The test was just, you know, a fraud test, basically. But they didn't want to hear that. I said they was trying to do it like some tax fraud type thing or something like that. You know, how does it pay and all that?</br></br>

So, that gets them paid. So, I felt they weren't caring about inmates at the time. They just basically doing what they want to help them get paid is how I felt.</br></br>

UCI: I see, I see. So, do you think your facility wasn't paying enough attention to you guys?</br></br>

Caller: No, not to a certain extent. Like I know a couple of people were refusing and things like that. Like and they would quarantine the whole cell. But these dudes protested and basically said like, "We ain't got COVID. Ain't nobody in here was sick, throwing up or nothing like that. And they're trying to force us to move, basically," is what the argument was, I know.</br></br>

And we weren't able to come up and go to yard and things like that, unless they was forced to take COVID tests and things like that. So, yeah, it's been quite an experience in jail with the COVID.
