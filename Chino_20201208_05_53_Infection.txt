This story was told by a person incarcerated at Chino.</br></br>

Caller: I'm personally I'm a transgender inmate, so aside from dealing with the COVID situation, we're still dealing with a lot of this stuff that relate to being trans as well. And and a lot of that being disregarded, especially treatment regarding trans individuals, medical treatment is being pushed to the backburner.</br></br>

We don't get any sort of regular treatment or the ability to see our doctor to have anything done or any adjustments made regarding the medically necessary treatment that we are supposed to have. I had to beg, beg them to finally even want to see me so I could get my mammogram done, which I'm way, way, way, way past due, you know those types of things. So yeah, I'm sorry.
