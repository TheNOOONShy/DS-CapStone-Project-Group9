This story was told by a person incarcerated at Solano.</br></br> 
Caller: I'm calling from Solano State Prison.</br></br>
UCI: OK, great. All right, so go ahead and tell me about your experience with the pandemic.</br></br> Caller: Well, first off, I guess I can say that it’s been like utter, complete, chaos. So, at first, they mandated masks, but, you know, one of the biggest problems is that there is a lack of, I guess, boundaries here and a lack of enforcement of rules and regulations.</br></br> 

So, specifically, the masks. So, we were mandated to wear masks. Yet there were many officers who refused to force compliance with masks, so you had inmates running around in the day room, with no masks. You had officers running around with no masks, and low and behold, we’ve had several breakouts. And a big part of that was the failure to force compliance with the masks.</br></br>  So, fast forward, now we’re at the, I believe it’s like 261 is our number now, and it’s still occurring where masks are not being enforced. We were placed in the gym, several people have diarrhea, blowing the nose, and we will ask officers for toilet paper and they refuse to give it to us.</br></br> 

And when they do give it to you, they give you a little small bundle of I don’t know, I’d say maybe 25 sheets of toilet paper. And you tell them "well, you know, this is not gonna work because, you know, my nose is running, you know, I’m blowing my nose." And they say "well you only get one roll a day," I mean well excuse me, "one roll a week."</br></br> 

And we’re trying to explain to them that, you know, we’re COVID patients. And they’re making us get on top bunks, and we’re explaining that "hey, you know, we’re feeling dizzy, you know we’re worried we’re gonna fall off, we have muscle pain" and they’re just like moving people around here and there. It’s just complete utter chaos.</br></br> Besides that, a lot of guys haven’t had much medical attention other than temperature checks and blood pressure checks twice a day on a daily basis. But nothing’s being given for their sore throats, for their runny noses, muscle aches. They’re not being given Tylenol, and when they ask the nurse, the nurse says, “Get it at canteen.”</br></br>

And then some of the guys are saying, “Well, we don’t have any canteen, they shut down our canteen.” And then they’re like, “Well put in a 7362,” which is a medical complaint form. However, it takes you two or three days to see a doctor.</br></br> For instance, they ordered blood tests for me, and nobody came to escort us to get our blood test done because they don’t want to deal with anybody that has COVID. It would be my guess, but I really don’t know, they just never came.</br></br> 

So that’s kind of it, in a nutshell of what’s going on. And I would have to say that if somebody is listening, hopefully there is an attorney that would be willing to investigate some of this and file a class action, because I mean that’s complete negligence to not enforce masks when corona’s spreading. We've already had one person die here at Solano.</br></br> 

And, I mean it shouldn’t have happened, there should have been enforced compliance. So, it’s just continued negligence, or I would say borderline deliberate indifference.</br></br>  I’ve even heard of one of the sergeants say, you know, “I don’t know why these guys want masks, they just need to all get sick so we can get this over with and get the program back to normal.” You know, and I looked at the guy and I said to myself, you can't be that damn dumb. You know, I mean people are dying over this virus and people are getting sick.</br></br> 

And so, it’s just this continued lack of utter concern for what’s going on. So, like I said, that’s kind of it in a nutshell. So, I don’t know if you have any specific questions you would like to know?</br></br> UCI: Well, I mean, it’s really just your experiences. I feel like you’ve explained a lot, you know, you said the doctors, you don’t really get medical attention unless it’s a temperature check. And so, these underlying, you know, symptoms, right?</br></br>

The diarrhea, the dizziness, shortness of breath, so you’re saying that even if someone, an individual, doesn’t present, you know, a fever, they don’t get any medical attention beyond just a temperature check. There’s nothing to help them, like Tylenol, you said, right? So, there’s nothing being done medically, can you elaborate a little bit on that?</br></br> Caller: Well, like I was talking to a guy the other day, and he’s like, “You know what? I have a sore throat, and you know, the doctor didn’t even give me any lozenges or anything. He said he had never even seen me."</br></br> 

You know, and I explained to the nurse that I had a sore throat, I have muscle aches, and then, you know, you have guys inside the gym where we’re at and, you know, you’ve got loud music being played, and officers don’t tell them to turn it down, and you’ve got guys that grab all the chairs and there’s no chairs for guys to sit down. And they don’t even, they don’t, it’s just like they’re nonexistent.</br></br> 

They just are existing without actually enforcing any rules or regulations. And that’s why we’re in this kind of mess in the first place, where they wouldn’t enforce people to wear masks which allowed the COVID to spread. But in regards to the medication, some of us have seen doctors, like myself.</br></br> 

I was given Tylenol and a cold suppressant, and it worked, but, I mean, it would have been nice to have lozenges because I did have a sore throat, you know. It’s just like, it’s kind of hard to explain but it’s not, it’s like almost like they give you the bare minimum.</br></br>  

Where, it would have been nice to see, like a doctor off the bat and say, “Hey, here’s lozenges, here’s, you know, cough drops, do you need anything else? Here’s some Aspirin, or something. What else do you guys need to help alleviate some of this?” But it’s like we got bare minimum to nothing. And some of us were actually luckier than others where we did get some care.</br></br> UCI: Right, because it sounds like it is very just sporadic of who sees a doctor and who doesn’t see a doctor, it’s very random.</br></br> Caller: Yeah exactly. Yeah. It depends on your symptoms. If you say, “I can't breathe,” then you see a doctor. But if you don’t say the magic words, you don’t see a doctor. So that’s how it kind of works, and it’s like, you know, what do you mean there’s like a special magic word to get treatment?</br></br> 

And, you know, some of the inmates know the magic word, some of them don’t. And it’s a shame that, that when things like that happen, they don’t, I mean we should have all been seeing a doctor. I know when I initially came in here, they’re like “You’re going to the gym,” I’m like “For what?” They’re like, “You have COVID.” I’m like “Do I? Where’s my test at?”</br></br> 

And it’s like, they’re like “Well, we don’t know.” “Well do I or do I not have COVID?” They’re like “We don’t know. Just, go, get your stuff, and go to the gym.” I said, “Well I would like to know if I have COVID” and I was here three or four days and I didn’t see anybody.</br></br> And then just on chance, I said “Well, you know, it’s difficult for me to breathe, it’s like I feel like my throat’s kind of constricted and I can't breathe.” And then that same day my doctor came down, he says, “Yeah, you’re having problems breathing, what’s going on?” I go, “Well, it feels like my throats like kind of tightening up and it’s sore, you know, my muscles are aching”, and that’s when he said, “Well I’ll give you some Tylenol.”</br></br> 

And he prescribed some cough suppressant called– shucks I don’t even know what it was called. Some little pill, and it somewhat worked, but not 100 percent effective, and that’s when I started talking to other guys and they were telling me that they weren’t getting any care.</br></br>  UCI: Hmm. Again, because they didn’t say the magic words. Right? You happened to have-</br></br>Caller: Exactly.</br></br>UCI: -the shortness of breath and so obviously that triggered a doctor. You said you got moved, though, prior to knowing if you had tested positive, so I mean, are they testing you guys? Are they testing staff?</br></br> Caller: Well, from what I understand is, staff are being tested twice a month and we were being tested, at that point, every two weeks. Because it had become an outbreak, so they had started giving these COVID tests every two weeks.</br></br> 

And they just come in the middle of the night and say, “Pack your stuff, you’re going” and you’d be like “Well, why am I going?” So, you didn’t know if somebody in your dorm tested positive, or you tested positive, it was just, “Come here, you’re gone.”</br></br> 

And, you know, we didn’t see any nurse or nothing, and it was the officers that were actually coming around and telling us to pack your stuff without giving us any information, so it’s kind of scary in the sense that, you know, we know that this COVID  is I mean, it’s deadly.</br></br> 

You know, you don’t know, it’s like Russian Roulette, are you the one that’s gonna die if you get it? And here, we’re just being told pack our stuff without knowing anything. So, I mean, we’re like scared, you know, we’re like, "hey what do you mean? Do I got COVID? Am I going to die?"</br></br>

Or, you know, "why am I not getting treatment?" And it was just kind of like a nonchalant approach to like “Hey well you know what if you guys aren’t dying, you’ll be okay. Just drink some water” type of thing.</br></br>  Real kind of, I guess not, real impersonal treatment, and I know the consensus is kind of like, you know, we don’t have any visits, meaning that the only place we could get COVID is from staff, either correctional officers or free staff.</br></br> 

And then, they would bring people in from other prisons that were infected, and we were like "why are they bringing them in?" Because all of a sudden, they brought a bunch of inmates from Folsom, and we had an outbreak of corona.</br></br> 

So, there’s kind of a lot of, confusion, and just not knowing, and lack of information that was going around that was kind of fueling the fear of people that you know “Am I going to die?” You know, you see the refrigerator trucks, on TV, and it’s just like, wow, you know, it’s kind of like surreal.</br></br> UCI: Absolutely, it sounds like a lot of shuffling too, right?</br></br>  Caller: Yeah.</br></br> UCI: They keep mixing you guys up, not knowing, you know, who’s testing positive, and who’s not testing positive, it’s a lot of, you know, a lot of people.</br></br> Caller: Yeah.</br></br>UCI: Have you been able to cope in any way with it? Are you guys allowed out on yard for amount of time? Or?</br></br> Caller: We were, until recently, they just shut down the whole entire yard, so nobody can go out. Now it’s like more anxiety because you have, it’s overcrowded, they have, they told us it was only going to be like 61 people and now they’ve double bunked so it’s far more than 80 people. And there’s like a lack of resources, like I explained toilet paper, soap, the showers are cold, the sinks are dirty, there’s mice running around, I found a black widow in my paperwork a couple days ago, so it’s just kind of like all this.</br></br> 

They’re going to cut me off in a minute though, so-</br></br> UCI: Yeah, well I really-</br></br>  Caller: Thank you for your time.</br></br> UCI: Yes, same to you, I really appreciate your testimony.</br></br>  Caller: Okay will do, definitely. I appreciate your time, and you have a good day.</br></br> UCI: You too, bye-bye.
