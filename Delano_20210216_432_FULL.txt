[redacted] and [redacted],</br></br>
 
Well, I recently received a letter addressed for [redacted] but the envelope was addressed by [redacted]. However, I truly appreciated your interest in how I’m holding up during this pandemic. It is very funny how the timing of your letter inquiring about my experience inside during this challenging time in the world. I recently filed a grievance regarding the neglect handling of the COVID-19 outbreak here.</br></br>

I was placed on quarantine along with my whole building, A1. As a result of several inmates testing positive on December 2020. Between December 23, 2020 through January 9, 2021, inmates continued to test positive in that building.</br></br>

I was tested three or four times and each resulted as negative. A total of over 56 guys tested positive and were moved to facility B or D. Ultimately after being quarantined for 21 days without any outside recreation, telephone calls to family, and no packages.</br></br>
 
On January 13, 2021, there was approximately 43 guys housed in facility building A1 who have all tested negative several times. No other inmates were housed with us. And then the craziest thing took place, medical or custody decided to move all of us that were negative of COVID-19 to an infected building. That being three or five block.</br></br>

So I was placed on an extended quarantine of 21 more days with the guys in building five because now they had experienced an outbreak. So I was tested several more times. Luckily, each produced negative results for COVID-19.</br></br>
 
I was isolated in my cell for 43 days for 24 hours a day, other than a 10-minute shower every other day. It was frustrating to see out my window, guys who tested positive return back to the fall program and privileges, after 14 days on seven days quarantine, on B or C facility. I felt like I was being penalized for testing negative, cause had I tested positive I’d been returned to general population.</br></br>

Finally on February 5, 2021, building five was lifted off quarantine.</br></br>
 
During this pandemic, I'm sure each and every prisoner in the nation have experienced a level of added depress and stress. Several guys have lost family members to COVID-19. As for me I’ve had my niece, aunt, son, and daughter test positive. It's definitely added concern for them and myself daily.</br></br>

But I try to remain positive that this shall pass and things will return to normal. Many guys here have been given the vaccine within the past week, which is a good sign. The news has been reporting that numbers have risen tremendously of people out there being vaccinated.</br></br>

Though we have a lot more to do, but it's still progress.</br></br>
 
The lack of visits have been really hard on me. Because the human/physical contact from family and loved ones are major stress releases. And I’m able to maintain those connections and family ties through being abreast on what’s going on in their lives.</br></br>

That I am unable to learn through a 15-minute phone call.</br></br>
 
Lately, to cope with this crisis, I’ve been writing and reading a lot. Recently, I began making donations to the LA Food Bank monthly. I figure through my earnings from my job I can afford to make a small donation to help those who are struggling to eat as a result of job losses and etc.</br></br>
 
Well, it's getting late. Hope to hear back from you soon. Feel free to ask any questions.</br></br>
 
Take special care.</br></br>
 
Sincerely,</br></br>
