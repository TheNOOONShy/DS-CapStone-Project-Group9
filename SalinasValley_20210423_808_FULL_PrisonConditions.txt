Hi there,</br></br>

Thanks for writing to me and showing me that you care. Well when it comes to my story, I'm a first time offender. I was sentenced to twelve years total for second degree robbery and ten years for use of a firearm (gun enhancement).</br></br>

The program on this pandemic has been separated and segregated more to where the population is split up and there is less contact. I would like to know how you found my name on the CDCR website, a public list. What list is my name on.</br></br>

It has been harder to program. We have been in the cells more, and no visits. It has been hard, but like you said I am going to pull through it and get up out of here for sure. I am just hoping I get a resentence so I can go home and do the right thing.</br></br>

But just write to me and I will reply. Have a good one.
