This story was told by a person incarcerated at Fresno County Jail.</br></br>

UCI: Well, I'm curious about what medical treatment have you received when you were sick?</br></br>

Caller: Okay, they gave me 15-minute testing, which is the swab to the nostrils, the nasal cavity, okay. One time I had the shivers; it was just the shivers, so they took me to medical. I let the correction officers know, and they automatically did it. But I came out negative.</br></br>

UCI: Oh. Did you still have symptoms at that time?</br></br>

Caller: No, actually, it was, I think it was three days later that they took the test. They called me again. They took my temperature, they took my vitals, and then three days later, they took the test. Okay, after three days later, okay, I'm negative. But why does it take three days later? You know, how come?</br></br>

UCI: What type of symptoms did you have?</br></br>

Caller: I was - I had cold sweats and the shivers, like, everything was so cold.</br></br>

UCI: Oh okay. Were you receiving medical isolation?</br></br>

Caller: No. They bring me back inside the facility that I was in.
