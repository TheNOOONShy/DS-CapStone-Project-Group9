This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Chino.</br></br>

On May 7th , 2020, I awakened feeling so weak that I could barely walk to from chow (about 100 yards.) I had to stop every 75' or so to rest, and felt about to pass out. At nurse's line, I ASKED to be tested overall. My blood pressure registered only 80-85/xxx. (Normal is anything over 100/xx). The yard's doctor admonished me for not staying hydrated, and had me drink a bottle of "pedialite" (a Gator-Aid like electrolyte replacement.)</br></br> 

Apparently COVID-19 causes the body to need massive amounts of fluids at the same time your body fails to tell you are "running dry". I'd been only drinking what my body told me I needed...because the prison medical staff only told those "positive" about this danger. When my B.P. showed 80-85/xx, the yard doctor ordered me taken to Riverside Hospital for emergency treatment.</br></br> 

At Riverside Hospital, I received I.V. hydration and a new COVID test. I learned that 15% of all COVID tests are FALSE NEGATIVES. The 20 or so of us in A-5 who tested "negative" were just about 75% of the building's population. When I returned to the prison that night, I related the 15% figure to the prison's medical staff, thinking this might be some valuable new information. The prison medical staff's response was essentially, "Yeah, we know."</br></br> 

Shortly thereafter, those "negative" inmates who had been moved to uninfected buildings were moved BACK to A5. One such inmate told me he had been ostracized by the "uninfected" inmates in those buildings, who protested his presence to the C.O's there. He also stated that inmates in the uninfected buildings who tried to talk to, or get close to him, were beaten up by their peers.</br></br> 

On May 12,2020, my B.P., 02 blood saturation and temperature had all deteriorated. I was told I might be moved to the prison's clinic for closer monitoring. At about 5 p.m., I was told to step outside to "talk to medical." Instead of "talk", I was summarily whisked off to Tri City Hospital in San Diego. I still (as of this writing, 6122020) have no idea what happened to my personal/legal property left unsecured on my bunk after I stepped out to "talk to medical".</br></br> 

At Tri City Hospital I was stripped of my remaining personal and state clothing and my I.D. and an officer told me, as he walked out the door, it would all be sent back to my prison's housing unit at ClM. (This would have lasting and unfortunate repercussions.) I was given 02 for three days and returned to CIM that Friday, dressed only in a paper prison jumpsuit and a pair of hospital socks.</br></br> 

At CIM, the prison decided I "wasn't done yet", and immediately sent me to Riverside hospital for more treatment - still dressed in the paper jumpsuit and socks.
