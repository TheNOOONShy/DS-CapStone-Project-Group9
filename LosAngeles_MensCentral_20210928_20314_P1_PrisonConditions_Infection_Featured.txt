This story was told by a person incarcerated at Los Angeles County Men’s Central Jail.</br></br>

UCI: Okay. And what would have made the situation at your facility better?</br></br>

Caller: If they were to give us more masks and actually give us like vaccines and stuff like that, where they'll come and actually ask us if we want to take the vaccine, instead of lying to us and say they come - they came to ask us.</br></br>

UCI: So you said that they aren't giving you proper – can you hear me?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah. Proper medical care. No, they're not.</br></br>

UCI: Okay. Can you repeat that last sentence?</br></br>

Caller: No, they're not giving us proper medical care. And they say that – they're not giving us proper medical care.</br></br>

UCI: Okay. I see. And-</br></br>

Caller: And it's only for the high power inmates. That's - that's only for high power inmates in L.A. County Jail, for like the general population high power inmates. They treat them differently than they treat everybody else, especially when it comes to us with the pandemic.</br></br>

UCI: Okay. And you said they - that they came about a week ago to administer vaccines?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah. Only to some of us, though, like only if you're high risk, not to everybody. So no, not for everybody, ma'am.</br></br>

They don't do that to everybody. They only do it to like – I guess they got a list or some kind of special list. I really don't know.</br></br>

They just come to a chosen few. And the rest, they don't even ask them if they got any symptoms or if they need disinfectant or - or hand sanitizer. They only – like there's about a hundred people in here.</br></br>

And they only gave like three, four people hand sanitizer. And that's it.</br></br>

UCI: And are they conducting any COVID tests or offering those?</br></br>

Caller: No. No, ma'am.</br></br>

UCI: So you guys are - are not aware of any COVID cases in your facility if they aren't conducting them?</br></br>

Caller: Oh, yeah. People – yeah – people – there's people that got sick in here. And I mean there's tests. But, like I said, it's like I guess it's a luck of a draw or something like that.</br></br>

I really don't know how the way they do their medical here. But they don't - they don't really care about us in here. And I'm trying to get our word out like so people can know just what's going on in this county jail is corrupted.</br></br>

And they don't care about us. They'd rather have us get sick or whatnot, and just tell us, "Oh, it's the flu. It's the regular flu,' while people have died in this county.</br></br>

But they don't put it on the news – over the COVID and got sick. And they just throw us back in the dorm. When someone gots COVID, instead of quarantine us, they throw us back in a module full of people.</br></br>

UCI: And do they offer any complaint system or like concerns or suggestions that you guys are able to voice to them?</br></br>

Caller: No, ma'am. Not at all, ma'am.</br></br>

UCI: Okay. And you said that people have died in your facility and they aren't reporting that?</br></br>

Caller: Yes, ma'am. They don't want it to get media coverage, basically. Because they want to make it seem like they - they come and they give us medical attention or they come and ask us like they said, on the news, one time, that they came to all of us and they asked us that if we wanted a test, if we wanted vaccines, if we wanted masks.</br></br> 

And most of us – I know I didn't get a mask. I know I didn't even get asked if I needed – if I had any symptoms. I didn't get tested or nothing. But, on the news, they said everybody was tested in that county jail, which was a lie.</br></br>

UCI: And how long ago did that happen, where you saw that media coverage that they said everyone was offered?</br></br>

Caller: That was like in the middle of the - of the virus, when it kicked off, like in the beginning, like two, three months after it kicked off.
