This letter was written by a person incarcerated at San Quentin.</br></br>

About eight weeks, my Covid symptoms began to ease some. Although, I am still not the same and doubt I ever will be, it was another twelve weeks before I began to feel some semblance of balance.</br></br>

One would think in these unprecedented times prison officials would mandate medical personnel and psychologist to examine and evaluate the entire incarcerated population. But no such decision has ever been made to date.</br></br>

In fact, I watch as officials make decision after decision which appear to be designed to spread the infection. I watched officials order whole housing units emptied in order to compact and double cell men in one unit. At the same time of this order, health officials were in the media constantly advising the public to social distance and wear mask.</br></br>

I watched as prison officials refused to open the windows in the buildings to allow ventilation, while health officials advised the public that proper ventilation helps to reduce infection rates. I watched as officials claimed to be deep cleaning the institution, when the only cleaning that was being done was the wiping of walls in between the cell and mopping the floor.</br></br>

When I asked one of the cleaners to wipe my cell door he stated “We are not allowed to touch the cell doors”. I watched as officials told the public they were releasing non-violent men with less than six months to serve their sentence, while although some were being released, there were a lot more men meeting that criteria that were not being released.</br></br>

In fact some men were being held beyond their release date for no apparent reason, and without explanation.</br></br>
