Hello I hope when you get this letter it finds you and your family in the best of health!!!  Thank you for taking your time and writing me. I am so glad that there are people out there that care about us.</br></br>

Yes difficult for all of us being in here with all this COVID going on our people cannot even come and visit us and some of us lost family members. I am blessed that my people did not even get sick thank to God. But I did have COVID but I did not get that sick. I had to be in my cell for two weeks had to get tested every three days that sucks.</br></br>

So that was up that you are a college student. What are you going to college for??</br></br>

Okay when this pandemic started  I was sad because I did not want to lose a family member so I started reading books and working out more that helped me out a lot. And about visitation, did not like it because they stopped our loved ones from coming and seeing us so every time when the weekend came I got sad but the good thing is that our people can come for 45 minutes and now we are waiting for June so our people can come and see us all day.</br></br>

The good thing is that this facility is doing the best they can do. By the way the vaccinations are going good everybody and myself got the vaccine.</br></br> 

I hope you and your family got the vaccine. What vaccinations did you get??? I got Moderna and they gave us a card to show our record. Well  I hope this letter helps you out have a good day. Hope to get a letter back soon.</br></br> 

Your friend.
