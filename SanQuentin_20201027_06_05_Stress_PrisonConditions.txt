This story was told by a staff member at San Quentin.</br></br>

Caller: The most frustrating thing about my experience is that CDCR is a closed system.</br></br>

UCI: Mmhmm.</br></br>

Caller: There is very little opportunity for outsiders who have expertise and knowledge in mitigating these issues to come into the prison and offer real solutions that could’ve wholly stopped the irresponsible spread of COVID. There were some UCSF doctors who were allowed to come into San Quentin. They then made the recommendations of decreasing the prison population by up to 50 percent, and that was the immuno-infectious specialist, and the disease control physician, and that was ignored.</br></br> 

UCI: Mmhmm.</br></br>

Caller: And then the major outbreak happened. But CDCR spoke to folks in Sacramento to tell every media outlet that they're, they are, you know, ensuring patient’s safety, that they hold the patient’s safety, in the highest regard, and they’re doing everything they can. And in actual, that might be in theory, but in practice, it’s absolutely not happening. There’s a huge disconnect from Sacramento to what’s happening on the ground, and there really isn’t any way to, to oversee or to make sure these policies are actually being implemented. That’s the frustrating part, is that they’re actually able to get away with it.
