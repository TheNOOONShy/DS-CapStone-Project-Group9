This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Soledad.</br></br>

The CCPOA (California Correctional Peace Officers Association), the prison guards union, would have the tax payer believe, that on any given day, that the only thing stopping us fire breathing, unredeemable, murdering, raping, child eating monsters from spilling onto the street like a scene from any zombie movie, and devouring the unsuspecting public, is them, the correctional officer.</br></br>

Once they claimed they "walk the toughest beat". A good portion of them don't appear to walk any kind of beat. Before I continue an ugly, but accurate description of guards, make no mistake, prisons are here for a reason.</br></br>

They are full of bad people. The guards have a job to do, most of them do it. Most are respectful.</br></br>

But because of their union, the ones like the ones I am about to describe continue to collect a check and their attitudes, racism, poor work, and social ethics destroy morale for staff and inmates alike. Considering the current climate regarding race and lack of public trust towards government, these individuals actually do a great deal of damage and they perpetuate that goes both ways between cop and criminal.</br></br>

The solution to almost everything wrong in prison is cameras, cameras, cameras. The California prison system, and all that it relates to it has become what it has become because the CCPOA always has and still does absolutely control the narrative regarding this world behind the wall.</br></br> 

I'm certain, the taxpayer, no matter which side of the political aisle they are on, republican, democrat, tough on crime, lock them all up, let them all go, and especially during the current state of the economy, would not stand for what actually goes on in here. If they could see how their tax money is wasted.</br></br>

It is super bowl Sunday. People on the streets are dying, starving, homeless, jobless, etc. All of the kids impacted by this virus, in regard to school will be forever be impacted by this anomaly. Their ability to get higher education, health care, a home, a family, is very uncertain.</br></br> 

So it's a stinging insult in my book, to see a morbidly obese, disrespectful prison guard, lean back in his chair, about to break it, sweating from sitting, stuffing his face, and watching the super bowl. While pulling a double because they manipulate the overtime.</br></br>

I suspect that if the taxpayer could go online and look at a live feed of any prison, at any time and anywhere, inside that prison via cameras, the face of California's prison system would change so fast it would be overwhelming. Accountability.</br></br>

The laws, our sentencing, the amount of prisons in the state are all the result of a public that does not know that they need to know. The handling of and the spread of the COVID-19 virus inside the prisons would all be impacted with cameras. A picture is worth 1,000 words.</br></br> 

The public owns and pays for these prisons. Then pay these guards to do a job. But what kind of return are tax payers getting for their money? None.</br></br>

I envision a website that taxpayers would log onto, that would be similar to watching CBSs Big Brother reality show. And no matter the individual's motives for viewing the goings on inside of a prison. I.e., want to prove/disprove that guards are giving the taxpayer their money's worth, want to see what inmates are doing to be rehabilitated, how they are spending their time.</br></br> 

When riots or staff misconduct is alleged, bingo, high definition proof one way or another. Cameras need to provide the public with full coverage.</br></br>

I express this because for example there may be one or two cameras on any given yard, but all the staff know exactly what the cameras coverage is. So, they sit on their table, or bench, or chair that they do their eating, napping, etc. out of the sweep of the camera. Or they allow the cameras to become dirty so that the footage is obscured.</br></br> 

My entire term I have wished they would wire these prisons up.</br></br>

Footage of guard's misdeeds is the reason they scoff at cell phones in the hands of inmates. The news classically repeats the mantra that inmates use the cell phones to carry out nefarious criminal plots from behind bars. Some may.</br></br> 

I used the one I had that a cop brought in, to talk to my aging parents, play games, get cute pictures of baby animals, and educate myself in different matters.</br></br>

But the thing that absolutely horrifies these guards is when events like a riot occur and the prison tells the media their heroic version of the event, and then some inmate sends the same media video footage of said riot and it shows the guards standing by watching. 

The reason the penalty for a guard bringing in a phone is only a misdemeanor, is because so many of them are bringing them in. Of course, when a guard can buy a cheap 60-dollar cell phone and sale it to an inmate for 1,500 dollars, not a bad investment, eh.</br></br>

The prison also slanders inmates' families by claiming all these phones are being introduced into the prisons by having the female family member secrete the phone in an orifice to smuggle it in during visits. Funny thing though, due to the coronavirus there have been no visits in CDCR since March 2020, but there are still ample drugs and phones everywhere. I wonder where they are coming from?</br></br> 

Need cameras.</br></br>

The questionnaire I received from you was premised on causing prison reform. It is psychologically encouraging to believe that someone cares. I could and happily would elaborate on anything I have touched on or any other questions you have. It's unfortunate that human life is still a commodity.</br></br> 

Slavery is still alive and well.</br></br>

Even after 23 years in here, I still don't stereotype the guards as most of them do us. And I still absolutely believe that cameras would solve everything that is wrong with these prisons. Not clips used for propaganda from some riot in 1989. With technology advancing the way it is, cameras are getting smaller, cheaper, clearer.</br></br> 

If the guards have nothing to hide, "what are they worried about the cameras for"?
