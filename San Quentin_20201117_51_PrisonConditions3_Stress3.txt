Well, I can say that being incarcerated during this global pandemic has brought uncertainty and a landslide of unanswered questions, for instance: How long will this modified programming continue within the prison system? Will the incarcerated population be tested for COVID-19 if symptoms are consistent with this disease anytime after?</br></br> 

What if incarcerated people contract COVID-19, will they receive proper medical care and ventilatorâ€™s if needed to have hope for a positive outcome for them and their families? Are the incarcerated population housed at 100-year old plus institutions more at risk during this pandemic? Will staff continue to work in these facilities if they have been exposed or are found to be a-symptomatic? Will a large portion of the incarcerated population be considered for release or parole prior to contracting this disease based upon their time served, age, medical history, post conviction behavior, etc. because COVID-19 is highly contagious and a deadly disease that can devastate the incarcerated population which is already extremely overburdened?</br></br> 

These are just a few relevant questions asked by those who are incarcerated. The issuance of a cloth face mask and a small bottle of hand sanitizer is not the remedy nor moving or transferring the prison population around and around during an active pandemic. No one is requesting the key to these doors but something has to be done.
