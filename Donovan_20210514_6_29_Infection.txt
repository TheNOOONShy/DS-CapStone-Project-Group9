This story was told by a person incarcerated at Donovan.</br></br>

UCI: I’ll go ahead and I’ll ask you just two questions. And then after that just go ahead and use all your time. What facility are you currently housed at?.</br></br>

Caller: I'm in RJ Donovan. San Diego, California.</br></br>

UCI: Okay and then how has the vaccination situation been like at your facility?</br></br>

Caller: It’s been actually good. It’s been, well at first they were doing all the elderly but right after they got done with all the elderly, if you caught COVID, they were not giving you the vaccine. Like for me, I caught COVID in December, so I didn’t get - eligible for the vaccine until like, March, April. And, but actually, it’s been all right.</br></br>

As far as vaccinations go, yeah, they've been on it. There were actually medical staff going around on the yard, going up to individuals asking them “Do you want the vaccine? Let’s go to the building. Let’s go now. Have you tooken your vaccine?” They actually had two nurses going around on the yard, asking people individually. Because sometimes they know how people are in their cells.</br></br>

They’re, not everybody is a day programmer. Some people, they like to sleep all day and stay up all night. So when their door opens they’re like “No!” and refuse and whatever. So when, any chance they could get, they actually did go around and ask individuals if they wanted the vaccine.
