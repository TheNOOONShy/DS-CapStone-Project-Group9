This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Jamestown.</br></br>

I am a California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR) prisoner and currently serving my time at SCC. The yard I’m in is a programming yard advertised to provide a environment similar to that which we would face if integrated back into society. While offering additional programming opportunities for rehabilitation and restorative justice in a humane environment.</br></br>

Regarding the states most recent amendment to their employment contracts adversely affecting their pay, staff here at SCC continue to express deliberate disregard for the daily movement schedule (DMS). Subjecting us to the compromising and inhumane environment of overcrowding.</br></br>

During the immediate COVID-19 pandemic, their reckless disregard for our wellbeing in the light of current state order to social distance at least six feet from each other and spend as much time outdoors.</br></br> 

Furthering the decreased risk of contamination and infection. Subjecting the population to inhumane living conditions that have proven to be fatal by compromising both our emotional and physical health.</br></br>

Staff here at SCC continue to not run yard daily for all the inmate population. Forcing us indoors where it's impossible for 16 inmates, let alone 28 or 32, to maintain a safe socially distanced environment. Let alone a humane one.</br></br> 

To these inhumane conditions SCC staff are not allowing mail flow to be distributed to the population in an efficient and productive time frame. Resulting in mail taking one month or more before being issued to the addressed prisoner. And at times just not making it to their recipient, whether coming or going.</br></br>

If the impediment of our immediate health or obstruction of our United States mail wasn’t enough, staff is not efficiently allowing us access to phone sign ups and/or to the phones when you’re on the phone access roster. Half of the privileged inmates are not getting their one phone call per day.</br></br>

Let alone two or more as consistent across state institutions operating within the designated programming incentive criteria. Further hampering our immediate family ties as well as our mental and physical well being.</br></br>

The population, as well as myself, are aware of the potential safety and security risk posed by enforcing the DMS while understaffed. We don’t expect staff nor the population's safety to be compromised by such insufficient and reckless management of institutional operations.</br></br>

But in light of restorative justice, other factors should be considered and implemented ensuring a safe and efficient environment, for not just staff and society, but the inmate population too.</br></br> 

As quoted from Supreme Court Justice Ms. Sotomayor, “society is measured by how they treat their prisoners.” A reasonable compromise, which doesn’t compromise the safety of society, is to continue to run phones and incentive programs. Such as canteen and packages regardless of the amount of custody staff.</br></br> 

If for nothing else to keep in tact and promote good conduct while maintaining humanity, self-worth, and healthy immediate ties.</br></br> 
 
It’s 11:45 am on Monday, March 15, 2021. School, medical, and other essential assignments are being performed by the inmate population. But phones are empty, canteen continues to not be ran, whether bag and drag or window shopping. And despite R and R staff ensuring packages would be ran today after not doing them yesterday, no packages or yard is being ran.</br></br>  

Nor has it been ran consistent with the DMS since amendments to these officers' employment contracts. As the inmate population is held accountable for their irresponsible choices, no less should custody and administration here at SCC and abroad be held accountable for their manipulation and undermining of institutional security.</br></br> 

Whether that’s not showing up for work or simply not efficiently performing their post duties while the left hand blames the right and the right blames the left.</br></br> 

I, personally, have been at SCC since February 2021 and am currently awaiting review Under California penal code SS 3051 by a youth offender parole hearing, via criteria expressed in California penal code SS 4801. Despite submitting second draw incident request forms for incident supplies, I have not received either February's or March’s issuance.</br></br>  

Nor have I been issued my envelopes and paper for August 2020 through February 2021 incident envelopes. While Pleasant Valley State Prison further obstructing my access to the courts, outside advocates for prisoners, both state and prison officials, legal counsel and immediate family ties.</br></br> 

I, as well as the rest of the population, am deeply concerned about the lack of accountability and direction practiced abroad in California's institutions. Often the population and media are presented with propaganda advertising, expressing, and emphasizing rehabilitation and restorative justice. Often this has been rationalized even at the expense of our physical and emotional well-being.</br></br> 

As seen in CDCR’s recent and immediate implementation of the non-designated program. Integrating both general population and any designated population regardless of the expressed concerns of the inmate population. And resulting consequences of forcing non-programming inmates to program with those of us desiring a positive and effective programming environment.</br></br>

Where we can safely and effectively educate ourselves and positive behaviors on there to end both immediate and intimate relationships eminent to our successful reintegration back into society.</br></br> 

Would you please give all your attention to ensure the desired and advertised environment of a humane environment. Promoting both rehabilitation and restorative justice, as well as enforcing CDCR staff conduct expectations. While disciplining to the fullest extent both administrators and officers who do not act in a positive and respectful manner that's outlined in the departmental policy.</br></br> 

Within the last 48 hours I have been verbally assaulted. And my state and federal constitutional rights violated when attempting to address my concerns regarding the facility system. For a special purchase package that has been here for two weeks.</br></br> 

Yesterday, a correctional officer refused to allow me to speak to the sergeant upon my repeated unsuccessful attempts.</br></br> 

Today two officers told me to “shut the f up” and emphasized that they were tired of talking to me about it. Not only do I not have access to a 602 form, but what would a 602 achieve for the injury right now? Which was caused by staff malfeasance not my irresponsible choice or the lack thereof?</br></br>

Nothing in the current administrative grievance process so much as purports an efficient and effective solution regarding preventative restorative justice. Let alone an efficient remedy in achieving redress.</br></br> 

Thank you for your time and patience in hearing my concerns. And for any intercession you or your appointed personnel feel necessary to ensure that advertise mission and vision of CDCR. Providing a humane environment through rehabilitation and restorative justice programs, is the intent and objective of all CDCR staff. Including officers and administrators here at SCC.</br></br> 

Respectfully submitted.
