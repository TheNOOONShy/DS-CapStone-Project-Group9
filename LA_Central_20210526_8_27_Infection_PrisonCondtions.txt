UCI: Awesome. Okay and so, how has the COVID situation been like at your facility?</br></br>

Caller: Okay well I’m just transferred down from a different state prison to Los Angeles County Men’s Central Jail and I was, it’s probably one of the most horrendous processes anybody could ever [unintelligible]. Due to the simple fact that, the processing for COVID inmates and how they’re treating people.</br></br>

Like, for instance, I was basically made to stay in a paper suit for two days that I was transferred in, in a freezing cold room with no blankets, dirty, filthy, rotten conditions, begging for a blanket. And none of the, none of the deputies or free staff would help me.</br></br>

UCI: Wow. And so, considering that, what, you know what, did you get, did you receive that? After or any time after that?</br></br>

Caller: So, after two days, then I finally was housed. It literally was over, over a week before I even seen a bar of soap. It’s like, just the whole process, the cleaning process, the sanitation.</br></br>

And one deputy says, “Hey,” he tells me, “We’re just not equipped to deal with COVID and I’m sorry, you need to appeal it.” You know what I mean? Still to this date they won’t give me an appeal issue. I got here on [redacted] of May to Los Angeles County Men’s Central Jail.</br></br>

UCI: You know, considering all those conditions and everything, how has the vaccination process been like?</br></br>

Caller: So, what they did, just recently in the last couple days, a team of, first they came through and asked anybody who wanted to get vaccinated to let them know that alright they’ll be there. And then they showed up, like early, early morning hours, And the program that I’m in right now, they’ll leave the TVs on until four in the morning at 100 percent so people don’t sleep.</br></br>

So, a majority of people said yeah, I’ll take the vaccination. When they showed up they were just too tired to even get up. But there was a lot of questions about the Moderna and especially, like, the Johnson and Johnson vaccination.</br></br>

And a lot of people were resistant to taking it in concern for their safety and well-being. And the nurse, I just, I was really surprised at the inadequate questions, or not questions but the information that was provided on the vaccination as far as any harmful side effects or what the, anything.</br></br>

They just said, “Oh they’re just, they’re going through the process.” It was just kind of baffling to me that they were just so vague on the thing. And only a few people maybe out of about ten people that signed up took it.</br></br>

UCI: Okay, and how have you been dealing with the whole crisis? Like, with the vaccine going on and with the situations that you’ve been handling…</br></br>

Caller: Well, I myself, I caught COVID. I’m sorry, I didn’t let you finish, but I caught COVID twice. I got it in January, February of 2000 and let’s say 20, and then I got diagnosed with it actually in August of 2020 at Avenal State Prison.
