Dear UCI student,</br></br>

Made this letter finds you safe amidst this COVID dynamic. Thank you for the message and pure concern.</br></br>

This first wave of COVID happened when SATF mixed the inmates from one yard to another. The only real safe spots are the cell living, with one inmate on E yard. Right now, I’ve been COVID free. Now I’m back on F yard where the administration has us in eight men pods with no six feet. Placing us inmates on another dangerous path. With no regret.</br></br>

The media needs to come see this first hand. It’s sad one or two inmates has a cell phone, but refused to use it for the right cause sad. Also there’s still guys in wheelchairs over 70 years old amidst us. King County courts even refused to honor the writ of habeas corpus they receive under COVID, to release anyone due to this pandemic. Again sad!</br></br>

By the grace of God I’m alive and COVID free. Even when our stimulus checks come, CDCR hold our monies for two weeks to 30 days. Also let me say CDCR was expecting us inmates to lose it for sure, some stress levels are high all over. The new year is a blessing and I’m still pushing mentally, physically, and spiritually.</br></br>

I know there’s a name behind this concern UCI student? Right now I’m locked up for a marijuana case I caught in jail and received 25 years to life in Riverside County in 2011. Since 2018 I’ve been trying to get the abstract of judgment to show marijuana case - misdemeanor, coincide with prior violent case of 49 with a half, that was completed in 2016 concurrent or consecutive.</br></br>

On CDCR sent a legal letter to Riverside court saying we - CDCR will call the sentence consecutive/this is an illegal sentence, because CDCR has no judicial authority to call a sentence concurrent or consecutive without the “abstract of judgment.”</br></br>

Especially after prop 64 marijuana act of 2016 made it clear that marijuana is a misdemeanor of less than 28 grams. Please look into my truth case. UCI students it’s hard to fight when there’s no outside support. I am one, document away from my freedom!</br></br>

Respectfully submitted.
