This story was told by a person incarcerated at San Bernardino Central Detention Center.</br></br>

UCI: Alright and so what has - what has COVID been like at your facility for you?</br></br>

Caller: Been pretty crazy. I've been down for like - a year - going on - going on a year like in a week, and been pretty hectic. But I honestly turned into a germaphobe, due to people like falling out everywhere throughout the whole facility.</br></br> 

So it's like - I don't know everybody's really hectic. They - they help - but I don't know. I honestly I just wanted to call this number to see what you guys are talking about. Hello?</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, well we're just - we're just here to listen to any stories that you have related to COVID-19 and how it's like affected your situation being in prison.</br></br>

Caller: Okay. Well honestly, I have - I have friends that will better tell you my - because it's like a lot to say - because I don't really have the right words to say.</br></br>

UCI: Well how about the vaccination situation? How has the vaccination situation been like at your facility?</br></br>

Caller: Vaccination day, they offered it one time, but due to, I'm glad I said no because there's a lot of people that are getting it, and it's not even working, so like there's more like by watching the news and seeing people out there getting sick with the vaccination like. So other than that it's not-</br></br>

UCI: How about your loved ones? Has - has the COVID situation affected anyone that you know?</br></br>

Caller: Not anybody that I know. My kids are healthy thank God. But - yeah, I think my son had to get the vaccination in order to go to school, but I don't agree on all that.</br></br>

But yeah, because I was - the effects on like - that's what I was thinking, you know? But yeah, my loved ones are fine, I only have my three kids. They are the only ones that answer my calls so I don't really have nobody else. It's only those three.</br></br>

UCI: What has it been like for you to have reduced visitation?</br></br>

Caller: Visitation, well, I - visitation they keep canceling on me but I don't have nobody to visit me but I really don't get out, but it like affects the other people that have their families that come and visit them because they keep bringing people from other facilities over here, and then every time they bring new grass of people over here, we have to go on quarantine because they just keep mixing the germs from other facilities and  bringing them over here, so they have to keep shutting us - lockdown like - like lockdown but all of - like one - but other than that, it's like sort of like stupid on their part because it is never - never gonna get fixed, such like - COVID from the street </br></br>

There is always somebody who catches it and they have to go man down because you can't - because of COVID like everybody gets on lockdown it's just like - you spend some time in here - it's like not good for your medical state, but there's good people in here, you know, I feel like you know? It affects a lot of people. People - pretty much like back of the head, thinking about that - because, you know, I don't know.</br></br> 

I don't know what else to say about it. But I have one of my friends in here. He - he will give you guys a call, and will like - he knows everything.</br></br>
