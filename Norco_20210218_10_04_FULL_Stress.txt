This story was told by a family member of someone incarcerated at Norco.</br></br>

Caller: Hi, I'm calling on the behalf of [redacted].</br></br>

Due to the COVID-19, being that he was incarcerated, he has not gotten the help that he has–– should’ve received. We have other family members that have been incarcerated that speak English, he does not speak any English. And has not even had the opportunity to have phone calls during the time of the pandemic.</br></br>

When he was sick with the COVID, he did not have no stimulus refund. Being that he is a US citizen, he wasn’t–– he didn’t get no help. No stimulus, any- no kind of help at all. So I just wanted to bring this to your attention. That you might want to help other people and- out there that can’t speak English.</br></br>

Maybe you could share this with other people. That some people that can’t speak English inside those doors, need somebody–– interpreters. Because of COVID-19, they didn’t have all that, so a lot of them lost a lot of opportunities. And a lot of them suffered mentally, emotionally with their status.</br></br>

But to  buy out letters and stuff, it was really hard for us. And I understand that we are all in a deep crisis but maybe if they could reach out and send some help for those people that don’t speak English that can’t read these letters. These are all in English, some people don’t speak English in there, so this doesn’t help them any.</br></br>

So maybe they can get someone that could help them communicate with their outside- friends on the outside or family-organizations that can help them to contact their loved one. By letter or by phone. But getting the opportunity to, not because they are not speaking–– they don’t speak English, that they should not be treated differently.</br></br>

Thank you.
