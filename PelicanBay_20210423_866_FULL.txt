This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Pelican Bay.</br></br>

I hope this letter finds you staying healthy and happy. I received your letter, and so I am writing back to you guys, to hopefully shed a little light on the pandemic situation here at Pelican Bay. Now it is pretty much over. I have already received both vaccinations, and I feel fine. I am 64 years old and a White male.</br></br>

The vaccinations are offered to everybody. It is not mandatory, but optional. To be very honest, I was a little scared about catching COVID at my age. I kept seeing all these old cats dying on TV and it really made me think. I was a gymnast in high school, and in construction for 45 years so I am in excellent shape, but cover doesn’t attack your shape.</br></br>

When it first started, this institution was doing it straight backwards. The CEOs would ask us, do you have any symptoms? My answer would always be, the question is, do any of your cats have any symptoms? Us inmates cannot go anywhere, you guys come and go daily. You people are going to be the ones that bring COVID-19 into this facility. Truthfully, the poor ass way that they took precautions was ludicrous.</br></br>

Now don't get me wrong. A pandemic is like having a kid. Your first time, you don't know what the hell you're doing, so I have to say that. Our captain, a woman, tried to keep us safe. I tested positive, but I never felt sick at all. No temperature etc. Nada!</br></br>

The main thing I think is completely wrong, is if you go outside of the prison for any medical appointment, you get a 14 day quarantine when you come back. Even if you go outside for five minutes, it's still a 14 day quarantine. But the two COs that escort you on this little excursion, get to run around, go home, and come back the next day, like it’s the thing to do. No quarantine!</br></br>

You see my point. Why are we getting punished even more for seeking medical attention? I work IDL (Inmate Day Labor). We do all the construction around the facility. I make one dollar an hour. Good pay for a prison job. So do the math. A two week quarantine costs me 80 dollars. But all in all, I feel blessed, and I will explain why.</br></br>

You might want to grab a Snickers bar. This might get a little warning-winded! Haha. I am an alcoholic, and have been since I was 16. I was born an addict, my birth mom was taking synthetic heroin while carrying me. I was incubated for my first two weeks in this world.</br></br>

As an adult, I functioned very well. I became a licenced roofing contractor in 1996, and I did very well contracting. I have had 150,000 dollars in the bank and an annuity two separate times. All I did was work and drink. It destroyed my life. I ended up living under a bridge and panhandling for drinking money.</br></br>

In July 2010, I walked into a bank very intoxicated, no note, no weapon, demanded money, received 180 dollars and a 21 year prison sentence. Here is the blessing, I would drink myself to death! The prison sentence saved my life. I have been sober now for almost 11 years. I got a second chance at life, and I am extremely grateful for that. It is not by far where I want to be, but I still draw breath.</br></br>

Now, back to the pandemic. They shut down all visiting for a year now. I don't get visits, so that did not affect me. All of cour classes have been cancelled; AA, NA, church, etc. So you cannot earn any good time credit towards an earlier release. So what they did was take 90 days off everybody’s sentence.</br></br>

Sure there were times when we were in our cells for weeks at a time, but you can survive and be miserable or just deal with it. I choose to just deal with it. The pandemic did not really affect me very much. I have a TV, a radio, I get food daily. Again, I would much rather be free, but look at all the people in the world who don’t even have those things!</br></br>

As you get older, at least for me, your values change big time. I felt so sorry for all these people I would see in the news, just straight going through it. Single moms with two or three kids working to death about food and shelter. How in the hell could I complain about my incarceration, that I made happen, and not feel like a selfish bozo? I don’t understand why there is one person hungry in our country, especially children.</br></br>

I know this will never happen, there is just too much greed on our planet, but why can’t we give. Not sell, but give vaccinations to Africa and the poorer countries? USA, Canada, Europe. These countries have the resources to give. Because Africa is such a poor country and run by bozos, we will just let thousands of people die daily because they are poor. I know the way I think seems impossible to make happen, but it’s not.</br></br>

I love music, it is just so good for the soul and happiness. There was a song in the 70s by Three Dog Night, one verse was, “Deep inside a voice cries out to you, it’s not along for people have been crying too, if we don’t stop what we all see is wrong, I’m here to tell you, mankind won’t live long!” I have seen a lot of food come out of this pandemic. People sharing, helping one another, I just wish I could go a lot further.</br></br>

That beer about the song, you probably went, oh God this guy is just some burnt out 60s and 70s cat probably smoked a lot of pot, actually I did haha. Probably does yoga and eats tofu. Wrong! As I stated earlier, I will be 65 in November, and I would just like to get out and help in some way. Money and the collection of stuff is not an interest to me anymore. I have a lot of skills and construction and God knows people need shelter.</br></br>

I would like to apologize for my sloppy writing, and for giving you so much of my opinions. I know you want pandemic stuff, but it wasn’t all that bad. I could’ve spiced it up and said stuff like, oh my God, it was horrible. The phone company gave us two free calls a month, and that is still going on. Everybody still wears his mask, that is mandatory, as I totally believe it should.</br></br>

I should be asking you what in the hell is wrong with all these dumb asses running around out there, with no mask, partying like there isn’t a pandemic? People are dying for God sake. Anyway, they pretty much have this covered deal under control here. Every Monday morning everybody with a job, or any kind of vocational where you will be around others, will get a COVID test. Any positives are quarantined immediately.</br></br>

Like I said it’s pretty much over up here. Not to change the subject from COVID, actually it is part of what is going on because of it. I am not asking for legal advice or anything like that, I just want the public to be aware of this. People going back to court for sentence modifications that could possibly be an early release, are being delayed.</br></br>

Presents are using COVID-19 as an excuse for all kinds of stuff. I asked to see the optometrist and was told no longer coming to the prison due to COVID-19. I personally know two men that are still waiting to go back to court, to get released. COVID-19 again.</br></br>

The public voted on proposition 57, and it won by a large amount of hours. There are all kinds of changes supposed to happen through prop 57. They aren’t happening. Every prison in California is supposed to work on every inmate's case, to see if they qualify for different things. A senate bill 1393- The Fairland Just Sentencing Reform Act, went into law January 1, 2019.</br></br>

In the past penal code 667(a) required a sentencing court to add a five year enhancement to a person's sentence, for each felony conviction. Now it is discretionary, and up to the judge. Remember I told you the sentence I received. I got 16 years added on, for these exact things I just mentioned.</br></br>

In 2001 I got a terrorist threat charge. That is a verbal threatening comment to another human being. I still truly believe it is the most ludicrous charge of all felonies. I received a 16 month prison term and did nine months. In my current case, the court gave me an extra 10 years for the same crime I already did nine months for. Do you think this is fair?</br></br>

Pelican Bay has denied me for the past two years the opportunity to go back to court for a sentence modification, even though I have a letter from the public defender's office stating that I qualify. These are the stories I really wish your project was interested in. CDCR is straight lying to the public. They don’t want anybody to get out early.</br></br>

It is all about money and it saddens me big time. Incarceration of people (you have seen the statistics compared to other countries) is a multi billion dollar enterprise. I have been trying to get back to court for five years, and I will never stop trying. CDCR and a lot of people are having a meeting on May 7, 2021 about Penal Code 1170(d)(1). I am not going to get into it, read it if you have computer access.</br></br>

They are trying to get guidelines for people like me, five year prison term, 16 years in enhancements, I have been incarcerated for 11 years for 180 dollars and a non-violent robbery. As stated, I deserve punishment, and alcohol cannot be an excuse. I think I have paid my dues for my crime, and I am almost 65 years old, and you college folks are paying through your taxes around 70,000 dollars a year to keep me here.</br></br>

I pray they will let me see a judge hopefully this year or next. You said you wanted a story! I will be glad to answer any questions, or help your project in any way I can. Just write and let me know OK? It was nice to get mail from you, and I hope I hear from you guys again. Thank you for your time considering my letter. Stay safe.</br></br>

My respect and blessings.
