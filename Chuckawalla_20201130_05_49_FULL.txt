This story was told by a person incarcerated at Chuckawalla.</br></br>

UCI: So, what facility are you currently housed at?</br></br>

Caller: Chuckawalla Valley State Prison.</br></br>

UCI: And what is the current COVID-19 situation at your facility?</br></br> 

Caller: The COVID what?</br></br>

UCI: The COVID-19 situation at your facility.</br></br> 

Caller: There’s about 40 people moving out of quarantine back into our building.</br></br>

UCI: And have they been tested or-</br></br>

Caller: Yes, they have been cleared. But at one point, the whole yard was in quarantine.</br></br>

UCI: Okay.</br></br>

Caller: It started out - it was our yard was the only yard that was clear of COVID-19 for months and then they emptied one whole building, they moved those people onto other yards that had COVID-19, and moved COVID-19 patients on our yard. And then the whole yard got infected.</br></br> 

UCI: And was that recently?</br></br>

Caller: Yes ma’am.</br></br>  

UCI: What is the troubling, or concerning to you?</br></br>

Caller: That they're willing to put our health at risk. You know? And not only that, they - so we end up in COVID-19 that they brought, that the COs brought to us. Okay.</br></br> 

So that’s one thing, and now they want to move us around in the middle of the night at like 10:30 till three in the morning. Moving us to different - while we’re sick. You know, If we’re sick, we should be left alone to heal, you know, because they’re not going to give us medication anyways.</br></br> 

So, there’s no reason to disrupt our program. They should just quarantine the building and let us get well where we’re at instead of moving us from place to place.</br></br>  

UCI: And how was the COVID-19 situation handled at your facility at the beginning of the outbreak?</br></br>

Caller: They all handed out these masks that, they’re not N-95s, they were just cloth masks and the COs didn’t care if you wore them, or not. A few would mention you, mention it to you to put your masks on, but most of them - they would let buildings go and visit each other. You know?</br></br>

They were supposed to separate us. Building nine stays from building 10, building 10 stays from 11, but some of the COs would just let us go to building 10 if we want. From building nine or building 11, they didn’t care. They never even wore the N-95s until a year or nine months into the pandemic. Seven months, something like that.</br></br> 

UCI: And this is the COs?</br></br> 

Caller: Yeah.</br></br>

UCI: Okay. And so is it being handled differently now?</br></br>

Caller: No, not exactly.</br></br> 

Caller: They still want us to wear our masks, and they’re making a big deal out of that. And they’re making a big deal out of social distancing, but we crap a foot and a half apart, or a foot apart in the shower. They won’t let us play any handball or any other sports even though we sleep three feet apart.</br></br>

You know? This doesn’t make no sense. If the masks worked, then a lot of people in here wouldn’t have even gotten COVID-19. But everyone in the yard has it. So obviously the masks don’t work.</br></br> 

UCI: So the yard that you're on right now, does everyone currently have COVID?</br></br>

Caller: No, there has been - 80 percent of them have had it and are, have been cleared by the doctor.</br></br>

UCI: Okay.</br></br>

Caller: Meaning we have no more symptoms.</br></br>

UCI: Okay. And what would make the situation at your facility better?</br></br>

Caller: I guess if the COs would start doing their job.</br></br>

UCI: So that would be like wearing their masks and stuff like that?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah. Enforcing it and keeping people from one building from visiting other buildings.</br></br>

UCI: And how has the COVID-19 situation at your facility affected your loved ones?</br></br>

Caller: Well, I’m sure it stressed them out. They probably lost sleep. My daughter lost her mother to a car accident about a month before I got COVID-19. It turned into a pandemic, you know, because in the news, “Oh my gosh, everyone is dying from COVID-19”. It stresses them out, and it worries them. You know?</br></br>

UCI: And what has it been like for you to have reduced visitation and programming?</br></br>

Caller: Oh, it just causes me stress and irritation. You know? It’s like being punished for nothing, for no reason. You know?</br></br>

UCI: And how have you been coping with the crisis?</br></br>

Caller: I've been working out a lot and studying.</br></br> 

UCI: Are you currently registered, like, for college, or is it just your own studying?</br></br>

Caller: Well, I am registered to begin college in January, but I’m studying Relapse Prevention by Terence Gorski.</br></br> 

UCI: And what else would you like people to know about your experience?</br></br>

Caller: That it's really frustrating having to endure certain sit-, certain things or else get 115’s and get denied at the parole board. The COVID testing that was mandatory, and it shouldn’t be mandatory if we don’t have any symptoms.</br></br> 

Caller: So a couple times, I had it done five times. Two times, they drew blood, three times it wasn’t, they didn’t draw blood, but it was still uncomfortable. And why should we be forced to endure something that’s potentially a trigger situation or a high-risk situation? Okay, I just wanted to thank you for your time. And that’s it.</br></br>

UCI: Okay. Thank you so much for participating in PrisonPandemic. Please continue telling your friends about us and seeing if they would like to call in. And I’m not sure if you know about our P.O. box?</br></br>

Some people have called in from your facility, and there should be a flyer going around that you might be able to get your hands on.</br></br> 

Caller: Oh okay.</br></br>

UCI: But, yeah, we just wanted to let you know that we’re thinking about you. It sounds like a very frustrating time, and I’m sorry that you have to go through this.</br></br> 

Caller: Thank you, and be safe. All right?</br></br> 

UCI: You too. Take care.</br></br> 

Caller: All right. Bye.</br></br>

UCI: Bye.
