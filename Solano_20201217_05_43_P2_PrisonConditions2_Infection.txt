Caller: We’re not getting adequate yard or fresh air. Now some of the scientists on television are saying that, fresh air and being outside social distancing is a good thing.</br></br>UCI: Mhmm.</br></br>Caller: We’re locked in this dorm. We’re locked in this gymnasium all day, every day, days at a time. And we’re just not getting fresh air and exercise on a regular basis. We’ve been out one time, but just not on a regular basis.</br></br>Number eleven. We’re have no emergency medications. Like i.e., Tylenol, cough drops, vapor rub, analgesic bombs. Nothing, they’re giving us absolutely nothing. Then they’re saying "well there’s no cure for the virus", but they’re not helping with the moderate and the mild symptoms that men are suffering through.</br></br>

You know. They should be passing out cough drops and Tylenol and acetaminophen or whatever it is to help relieve some of the symptoms that guys are having, and they’re not doing it. And I don’t think that’s right.</br></br>UCI: So -</br></br>Caller: Also- yeah.</br></br>UCI: So, so basically, it’s like if you test positive and then you get like moved out, and you have symptoms, they aren’t helping those symptoms in any way?</br></br>Caller: In any way, no. They’re not doing anything. They’re locking you in a cell. And then from the cells then there’s, after a few days, then they send you over to the gym if you’re a level two like most of us are.</br></br>UCI: Mhmm.</br></br>Caller: And they’re just, they come through twice a day, and they do vital signs. They come in and take our vitals and do a pulse oximeter, and they do blood pressure and take your temperature and that’s it. And they’re not giving us anything.</br></br>UCI: Wow.</br></br>Caller: Absolutely nothing. And people are suffering. They’re sneezing, they’re coughing.</br></br>UCI: Mhmm.</br></br>Caller: They got a sore throat. It’s just a number of range of things -</br></br>UCI: Right.</br></br>Caller: That they could be doing, and they’re not doing it. They’re just not doing it.
