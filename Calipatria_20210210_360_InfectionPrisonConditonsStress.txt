This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Calipatria.</br></br>

I’ve been incarcerated for 29 years and this is the first time in my life that I’ve experienced physically the effects of this horrible virus. On December 15, 2020, I tested positive for COVID-19, called SARS-CoV-2. I was moved to an isolation area for 14 days.</br></br>

For the grace of God, the virus didn’t do any damage to my health. I personally believe that being inside during this pandemic has been very stressful, a deep sense of despair, and feeling helpless. I can’t be there with my loved ones. Also hearing the Governor of California is once again suggesting the possibility of having a stay home policy due to the increase of the virus.</br></br>

And this leads one to ask the question, what is really happening these days? But overall I feel that CDCR is doing a great job in keeping us safe from the virus. All of us in here are doing our part to stop the spread. It has been hard not being able to see our families and loved ones (contact visits).</br></br> 

But for now we understand that we have to work together to stop this pandemic. I want to personally thank the director/division of adult institutions for providing us with video visiting, which is making it so easy for us to stay in touch with our families.</br></br>

Now, in response to how I’ve been coping with this crisis? During this time of the pandemic, I’ve been reading my bible, writing family, friends and our struggling youth out there. Maybe by doing this I can avoid the darkness and despair that so many people have succumbed to during these days. By taking time to pray and be with God is giving me the strength to believe in the path of Jesus and to transform my life.
