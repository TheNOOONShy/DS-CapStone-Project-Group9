This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Soledad.</br></br>

Thank you for your sentiment expressed in your missive. It was a “I think” plesant suprise. I do not know how the University came across my info but no doubt greatful that people are aware. The fact that you care about and are aware of what is going on with us inside these walls is humbling. God knows we do not deserve it. It appears life is changed for us all.</br></br> 

I do hope that all are taking the necessary precautions and not allowing the “Doom & Gloom” conspiracies to cloud judgment. Trouble does not last!</br></br>

Stress
It has been a little confusing I think is the word I would use to describe my feelings. Watching on television and seeing CDCR officials figure out how to go about dealing with this virus and try to protect themselves as well. As you may or may not know there is a certain kind of mentality that exists with both incarcerated, staff and CDCR custody. While watching it seems as if we were all struggling to come to terms with what was happening and learn “at the wrong time” how to get out of each other‘s way.</br></br> 

Within these walls it seems as policy is ever evolving. It occurred to me that their isn’t any way to properly deal with something of this magnitude. I thought about this first after CDCR officials pulled me out of my cell to have me call home.</br></br>

Family
I was told that my mom was in the hospital in a vegetative state with only a respirator keeping her alive. Only she really was not alive at all. I was speaking to my sister “sobbing uncontrollably“ I can hear other family members fighting and blaming each other as I listined not knowing what I was supposed to say. The Dr. got on the phone and explain to me that my mother is no longer with us but that he has kept her on the respirator as my family waited to hear from me here at the prison.</br></br> 

At the time I did not know what to do. Normally I am not so easily at a lost forwards. Out of nowhere (I think and give God the glory) The words came to me to just comfort my family and encourage them. Only in the back of my mind I kept thinking; well what about me? I am not suppose to be dealing with all of this.</br></br> 

Instead I told them to put on my brother who had vented the most. Once on, I told him to comfort his sisters and that now is not the time to be fighting. Going on to say that this is that it is suppose to be, my son is supposed to bury his mother and not the other way around. I told my brother that his role now is to prepare for the funeral.</br></br> 

Knowing that they were all listening I said, all of you go and pray over her and give her a rose while she still lives (I did not know she was in some sort of bubble room) and don’t wait till she is gone to throw it over her casket. I was so numb as I said this. My brother says to me all of a sudden “[Redacted], I can’t see you” I say to him, what are you talking about? You know where I am. Except I did know inside what he was saying. I think I said something to the effect, don’t worry about me just do your part and take care of the family and hung up.</br></br> 

I left that phone call walking in slow motion back to my silently. I did not cry only swelled up a little later while thinking about it wishing I had some one to talk to about it then I was familiar with that I trusted. I wondered if I had said and done the right thing. But there was no one their to turn to or talk to so I kept praying.</br></br> 

A day or so later the prison pulled me out again to call home. Mind you, through it all the prison is on quarantine and no one understands this virus, especially me. I am still not taking it ”the virus” seriously. This last time I’m allowed to call all of my family is sitting around telling stories about what use to get on my mothers nerves and what use to make her laugh.</br></br>

My other brother had gone over to my mothers place to light candles because he was still upset that (we) allowed the Dr. to pull the plug. I was at least glad they were laughing. Covid19 had taken my mother and my family was getting past it.

Infection
About a month in a half later I get sick and I cannot explain what is happening to me. At first I thought it was a cold but it felt diffirently. Still I went into my jail house remedy in dealin with a cold. It did not work! I lost my sense of smell, I had no energy, I was sweating alot “I had chills”, my appetite left and I was having problems using the rest room.</br></br> 

Still I stayed on my normal routine until I just could not. A CO I knew came to my door with a nurse to take vitals and noticed that I was not myself and her together with the nurse insisted that I go to what is known as TTA (medical). I agreed only if they would give me an I.V. because I knew I was dehydrated. Well once the I.V. was in I went straight to sleep.</br></br> 

When I woke up the nurse told me that I had a temperature over a 100 degrees and that the P.A. Was sending me to the wing that those (at that time) The prison house the suspected of having COVID-19. She went on to say that the covid19 test was given but my results were negative. They only knew that I was sick and presented with all the symptoms of the virus. While the “Y” wing (covid wing at that time) I got worst.</br></br> 

I started throwing up, my equilibrium was off and I can no longer get anything down. I told myself to just fight, so I would just stare at my food until I had enough courage to try and force it down. I knew I had to eat and drink except I could not. Each time it would come back up violently. It felt as if I was having a seizure while throwing up because my body would lock up on me.</br></br> 

I should also note that while in the medical TTA the nurse per the P.A.‘a request did give me some pills, I think Tylenol 3’s and some sort of shot in the arm that hurted. I remember the nurse explaining that it was suppose to hurt. Not sure about most of the time line but later a nurse [Redacted] (registry) together with a CO explain that I was being moved to the gym (isolation) With those who were known covid19 patients. I just wanted to get better. Once in the gym I slept in the times I was awake I wondered if this is how my mother felt as she passed away from the virus.</br></br> 

However, this was only a thought. I have to say it was never afraid. I only wondered if this was the way I was going to go. So I prayed as I always do.

Prison Conditions
I have to say that through it all I felt comforted. As strange as it sounds. From the moment the escorting CO (correctional officer) came to get me, to the treatment within the TTA, then onced hosed in the gymand the way I was recieved my fellow inmates and even the way I was treated by staff. I say this as someone who does not walk in favor by custody in any prison I have been in and I have been incarcerated since 1994 as a juvenile lifer.</br></br> 

A long process in learning to be amenable. Still I can tell you I was humbled at how well I was treated. Especially bythose I had previously treated so poorly through disdain. Here was the chance to get back (I thought) at me. They were professional and showed compassion instead.</br></br> 

I definitely did not deserve to be treated humanely because of all that I have done and would have understood if they (staff or COs) would haveacted accordingly.

Infection
That said, the gym was a place we were sent to die. I found myself realizing that there was nothing to be done for us. Even hearing about a comment a nurse had said about feeling sorry for us because the hospital was not going to take us in because the public came first. ICU’s we’re filling up.</br></br> 

I thought about the fact that there was no known cure. We were just separated from (GP) General population. We were isolated! Is truely by God’s grace that we live, Amen. Knowing that there was nothing I could or nothing any one could put things in proper perspective. I had peace.</br></br>

Prison conditions
Still this prison is putting large military style tents on the yard prepairing for the worst I guess. They have portable showers and port-a-potties on the central yard as well. These things should bring fear to my heart and perhaps to someday would but as I said, the Lord has given me peace and I am not worried. I do feel a great deal of remorse for what is shown on the news and some of the incredible suffering. I will continue to pray.</br></br> 

Thier are several reports of inhumane treatment of inmates being housed in chapels here at the prison with no toilets having to use a bucket and showering in freezing conditions using a water hose to clean themselves. Custody allowing other inmates to pack other inmates property (which is not allowed) and the lost of valuables. Also staff packing inmates property and not using a property card to correctly inventory, again alot of lost valuables. This is only some of it, however, this was not my experience. Just some of the dark side of what exist here.</br></br> 

Thank you for listening and hearing what I have had to share. I can only hope that this means something to tomeone as in all that I do is to be used to change some ones life for the better. I hope this helps. Please feel free to contact me for further comments. Please excuse the ton of errors within typing.
