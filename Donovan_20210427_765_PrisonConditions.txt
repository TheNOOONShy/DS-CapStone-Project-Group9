This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Donovan.</br></br>

We just had came off that of the lock down, where it was set people get that of a visit, once each weekend for 30 to 60 minutes.</br></br>

Where we did go back on that of just one building on the yard, and one section at a time for dayrooms. Where the outbreak as well as that not one person on this yard had it in the first place, so we was placed back without visits and then we was all tested where 72 hours we was found to not have one person sick, or had it. So we came back off, to go back to the programming we did have where we open up more and more each week, as it shown that we do not have any reason to be locked down.</br></br>

It's just too cold for me to get out, where I will keep working to aid you, where I can. I did asked to get some stories, where I did look to have something, where in that same, it has not been anything nice going where it is. Where at the same time, there is that of where half the people on the yard is up for transfers, where it is wild up here.</br></br> 

Where we do have a yard full of level twos, and some are that of level fours. Where it is also that of a medical yard, where a lot of people need to go back to where they came from to go back to the prison they came from.</br></br>

East California Prison system sucks, where it is a major joke, where it is set on that of where it is not a protective program.
