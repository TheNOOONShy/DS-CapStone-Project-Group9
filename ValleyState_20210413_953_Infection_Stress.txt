The shock of COVID is as a pandemic was a tidal wave reminiscent of that evening as what little of liberty that I had left was suddenly stripped away, with the same unplanned and unpleasant sensation washing over me whenâ€¦ I came back to my housing unit, notified that there was an outbreak in the kitchen, the chow hall and unfortunately the kitchen worker in our cell that houses seven men in a room filled with bunk beds, a shower, sinks and a restroom tested positive.  I noticed that he hadn't looked well, yet I made no issue of it as he is a first-generation immigrant of Mexican descent, I feared being misunderstood because of the language barrier between us. Suddenly, I was told all of the sales would be moving into isolation. I arrived at a level 4 style building, imagine a castle with a dark dungeon as the sale to be shared with another prisoner. We waited for whatever instructions were our new existence. All the guards seemed informed, we were not provided any cleaning supplies, simply yelled at to lock it up, the tone implied that we did something wrong. 
<br><br>
No clue inside of when we would return to our past normalcy, finally we were tested, the nurse who did my nasal swab, had a look of apprehension on his face as I sat in the main room of the castle dungeon, with guards standing over us as though we were aliens at Area 51. Afterwards in the dungeon, my nose began to burn horribly. I asked my cellmate if he was experiencing the same thing and he said as he backed away as far from humanly possible and this impoverished closet space, that this was our new confinement den.  The next morning after no mail, no phone calls, and my last unit being with me with my parole attorney, after having food thrown to the door slot. I was told that I was COVID positive and that I would be moving to quarantine. Hours later I landed in a building similar to the building I normally occupied. Only now I was placed around God knows who? The room felt gray as the occupants questioned me of my condition, I questioned them the same, some appeared worse than others and others looked  healthy. 
<br><br>
The guards provided once again no cleaning supplies, without any formal instructions from medical. I disinfected everything that I could with shampoo and a sponge and Ajax I had managed to save. The occupants and patients waiting to be cleared after quarantine however they coughed freely. In the room, the guards were even worse, they ignored the occupants as the rooms which are closer to a hallway, with the ability to house 728 men each and are always being flooded with men coming in infected at all hours of the night and day. The stress levels were through the roof, arguments over the smallest differences, guards were  unwilling to tell us anything, life seemed like an abyss of darkness, and inertia. Having to help my former cellmate out with food, now left me in the position of possibly running out of supplies for myself. Store purchases or package deliveries were not an option because of the pandemic. Later after being tested by the same nurse who nonchalantly admitted that :he needed to get it right this time:, he apparently mishandled my original test and I was released.  
Throughout this entire ordeal, no cleaning of the cells was ever done, and finally, we later got a sparing amount of cleaning supplies and they were all passed out. We still don't get any mail or phone calls. My safety had never felt so compromised, even in the likes of nightclubs in SoCal or NorCal, I felt safer because I had my health and communication at my disposal, where no one even knew where I was located. Ive seen men placing their personal belongings into orange cracks and being directed to Mule the property for a few miles to isolate themselves. If you are too weak to do so, and you declined, that would be a write-up, and that is a distal disciplinary measure for a prisoner with a life sentence with no possibility of parole, spells out a natural disaster. I later found out of the crushing feeling in my heart, until the shortness of breath followed by chills with aches was in fact COVID. How can I have caught it? Oh, the past week when the kitchen officer cooked for the entire room, I pitched in and that's when I felt that way. 
<br><br>
The strain of not being able to see friends or family has been tremendous, I was fortunate enough to receive visits weekly and family visits three days every so often. So you can only imagine what it's like to go from that to limited phone calls. As there is a trickle-down of stress from the guards onto the population, not every one of them, but there is out of anger. The same negativity can be said of fellow prisoners who have had to COVID careless attitudes. I meditate daily and I'm very optimistic and yet there have been days on end while I have neglected to communicate with any family or friends. I found survival by myself and piles of work as a distraction to what's going on. I have lost two friends in here who were in good shape and I haven't had a moment to pause and mourn them. Instead I've ramped-up my own vitamin and supplemental intake and continue to push on through this ground hogs day on repeat cycle. 
<br><br>
I came out of my results window in January of 2021 after a September correction, and as of March 27th 2021 I finally received my first shot, currently awaiting dose number 2. I've done my best to be as helpful as possible to friends, family, my peers here and Stage as this pandemic has truly been a shock to my fears that has shown me just how fragile life is and that time is really priceless.  We are due to attempt a semi contact visiting schedule here in the next few weeks, hopefully once we've reached herd immunity we will see more contact, to give it thought is frustrating and saddening though. My mother and stepfather both retired professionals live out of state and are elderly, and I am keeping my fingers crossed that I will be able to regain my freedom within the right time to say goodbye to them in person, one last time which the universe would provide that blessing. Well Prison Pandemic team, I hope that this has been a help as it is difficult at times to get a good night sleep, I'm hoping that this will be useful at completing your project. Horribly embarrassing conditions to provide correspondence from, but I had my spirit pull at me to write this on behalf of those who do not have the ability to articulate, and once again in memory of my boys that I won't ever see again until maybe this life is over.
