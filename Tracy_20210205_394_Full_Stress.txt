To whom it may concern,</br></br>
 
Hello, I am an RC inmate still stuck in reception here at DVI in Tracy, California. I have stuck in RC for almost two years now, and due to the pandemic, life has been hell. Because we are RC, we are considered “unclassified”. Meaning we don’t get packages or a TV or even clothes, shoes, or any type of electronics.</br></br> 

For those of us that qualify for 33 percent, we don’t get any chance at that until we hit a main line. But because of COVID-19, we won’t get to a main line. Now back in August of 2020, they took two RC inmates to committee and granted them 33 percent, but I have put in several requests to get my 33 percent and been told no because I’m RC.</br></br>

We have been on 24-hour lockdown since, November 17, 2020, and for the first two and a half months also we got denied any type of yard time. Now, however, we get yard once every two weeks for one and a half hours. While the main liners get yard two to three times a week for two to two and a half hours every time.</br></br> 

Also we are not getting medical care like we should be. Eighty percent of medical slips turned in by RC inmates get ignored. I have be trying to see a doctor or nurse now for one and a half months.</br></br>

So all and all, we are completely being treated inhumane, and seems to not be changing anytime soon. I seen your flyer by the med-line window, and figured I’d tell you my situation.</br></br>

Thank you for your time. And hopefully this will reach the right person at some point and something will be done about it!
