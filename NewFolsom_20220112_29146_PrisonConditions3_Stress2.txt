This story was told by a person incarcerated at New Folsom.</br></br> 

UCI: How many people - how many people do you have with you in terms of the strike, the hunger strike? Do you have a lot of prisoners on board?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah. We have two buildings right now. I'm in one building that houses 100 people, it's two tiers. It's 50 on the bottom, 50 on the top. It's another building right next to us, the same thing 50 on the bottom 50 on the top. So it's a total of 200. We are currently housed in a TSU setting which is a psychiatric services unit.</br></br>

We're basically housed here for guys who's in the mental health program. Yeah, so are you familiar with the Coleman administration? Coleman v. Newsom.</br></br>

UCI: No.</br></br>

Caller: They're basically a class of federal lawyers who basically supervising and keep watch over CDCR on how they handle mental health patients. We're considered mental health patients, so we're under a different statute of law in CDCR. It was so much corruption regarding EOP inmates.</br></br>

That Coleman, a group of lawyers called Coleman in, located in Sac, I mean not in Sacramento, but in San Francisco, sued CDCR, sued the state, and forced CDCR to come up with a plan to specifically and specially house us and train officers on how to deal with us. It was so much corruption. I'm talking about, you know, they used to spray us in the face with the pepper spray, beat us with the batons.</br></br>

It was so bad that a federal judge, they showed us, they showed a federal judge a video of a, some criminal misconduct, a beating of an EOP inmate. The federal judge couldn't even watch the end of the tape. She told them to turn it off and made the ruling right then and there. It was so bad.
