Theme: Infection: Own experience with COVID


To the Dorm</br></br>


As I begin writing this on December 23rd, and confirmed by my December 24th swab test I was negative. However, without leaving my cell for any reason to avoid COVID, when they tested me on December 30th I am now infected, as is my cellmate.</br></br>
Our only contact with anyone was at our door, by correctional stafI, inmate food servers, and the medical staff. As a result of the same test on the same date, 32 inmates all in my vicinity all tested positive. We're all locked down, and no one went anywhere. So "they'' are infecting us.</br></br>
The medical staff conducting our vitals go cell to cell to cell without changing their gloves and without cleaning the oxygen sensor they stick on our fingers one inmate after the other. I wonder how it is spreading? It is peculiar, that these inmate infections are happening about 30 at a time and all within the general vicinity of each other. If I didn't know better, it is as though they are infecting us in batches to ultimately achieve herd immunity...... just saying.</br></br>


As a result of being infected by staff, they now have uprooted me from my cell and housed me in the dorm. I am in an open-air dorm with 156 infected inmates. The bunks are not six feet apart. I am on a top bunk nearest the main door coming into the dorm. My bunk is head height so every infected inmate passes less than six feet from me, exposed on the top bunk. I wonder how it is spreading.</br></br>
