This story was told by a person incarcerated at Chino.</br></br>

UCI: Okay. And, do you — if, if you have a cellmate, how have they been handling the situation too? Have they — have they been coping with it? Or what has that been like for any of — any of your friends inside the facility?</br></br>

Caller: Have any of my friends caught COVID?</br></br>

UCI: Yeah. Like, and if they did, you know, have they been cool about it? Like, how—</br></br>

Caller: Yeah.</br></br>

UCI: How have they been handling the situation?</br></br>

Caller: They got sick. Some people got sick real bad.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm. And, when, if they — when they got sick, were they transferred over to another facility or, like, a building?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah. One dude, he—</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>

Caller: One dude had a seizure and one dude had a seizure and went into a coma.</br></br>

UCI: Oh, wow. You said he had a seizure and one had a coma?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, went into a coma.</br></br>

UCI: Oh, okay. Wow. And did the correctional officers do anything to, like, kind of better the situation?</br></br>

Caller: They was sitting there — they was sitting there pressing his chest for about, like, 30, 45 minutes.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm. Wow.</br></br>

Caller: Trying to get him to breathe, to breathe again.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>

Caller: He started breathing at the last minute.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah. And, what about, like, the situation, I’m guessing you guys have a hospital in the, in the prison system. So, like—</br></br>

Caller: Yes.</br></br>

UCI: Have they been helpful too? Or, you know, have they been kind of like, leaving you guys aside?</br></br>

Caller: It’s basically they, they always, all they do is move - only thing they do when you get sick, they move you to a cell to isolate by yourself. That's how they do it.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, okay.</br></br>

Caller: They ain’t even take you to a hospital to isolate you. They take you to another cell to cell living. Individual cell living, and it’s staying in the cell by yourself.
