UCI: How has the COVID situation at your facility affected your family at home?</br></br>

Caller: Well, my family is actually doing pretty good. None of them have gotten sick. So, they're okay.</br></br>

UCI: How have you been coping?</br></br>

Caller: I've been coping all right. I mean, actually I'm fortunate that I can actually talk to my family. A lot of people are not fortunate like that. So, I'm doing great. I have a great family. They help me. They understand everything.
