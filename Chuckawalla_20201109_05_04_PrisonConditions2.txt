This story was told by a person incarcerated at Chuckawalla.</br></br>

UCI: The guards and the officers are not following the rules?</br></br>Caller: No. No, they just don't enforce them. They don't enforce them.</br></br>UCI: They don't enforce the rules among the prisoners?</br></br>  Caller: Yeah. Yeah, because they're lazy. I mean, when it comes down it, they - they're just - they don't want to do that part of the job; you know what I mean?</br></br>And just with us, of course, people are going to do what they do. They're going to go down to the day room when they're not supposed to be down in the day room, and they're going to do - try to go out to the yard when they're not supposed to be out in the yard.</br></br>UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>Caller: And people are going to come into buildings when they're not supposed to come into buildings; you know what I mean? And inmates can't really control that. I mean, you can try, but that's not - that's not your job; you know what I mean?</br></br>And they - they have to enforce that. I don't care if it's to where, like, okay, listen, we're going to write you guys up if you don't do this. Because basically you're still putting people's lives and health in danger when you're letting people run amuck.</br></br>UCI: Are the guards wearing face coverings and complying with -</br></br>Caller: Well, now some do and some don't. And some, if you say something to them, get serious attitudes.</br></br>Like we had a female officer come in here from Building three the other night - that's another thing. They come in from other buildings that are positive and work at other buildings that aren't. We had one come in from three building the other day after they just had 70 cases in there. She came into our building and did not wear a face mask all day long the whole day. And now if you go say something to them, then your little cube might get tore up, all your stuff gets tore down because they don't - you know what I mean?</br></br>They don't want you saying things to them. Like, no, you're supposed to wear it. If we have to wear it, you have to wear it. Oh, no, you don't want to do that.</br></br>UCI: Okay. So some of the guards wear it and some don't.</br></br>Caller: Yes. Yes. Some do, some - some wear it like religiously.</br></br>UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>Caller: And others just won't - won't do it.</br></br>They, like, nope. Nope. Nope.</br></br>
