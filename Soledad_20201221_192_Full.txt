Dear Prison Pandemic,</br></br>

Hello there, I hope this letter finds you, your family, and friends near or far in good health. Your letter was like a breath of fresh air, a complete surprise, and well received.</br></br>

So to be completely honest with you, it has been a lot more stressful being in here during this COVID19 pandemic. I'm worried a lot more about my family and friends living out there in society. The hardships that they are enduring, losing their jobs, not being able to pay their bills, or having enough food to eat, and worst of all, just staying safe and healthy and not contracting the COVID19 virus. For my safety in here, and trying my very best not to contract it myself.</br></br>

Well, I can only do my part to protect myself, wear a mask whenever I'm outside the cell, as well as practice social distancing, and wash my hands. I've always had very good hygiene, but now, I think I have OCD, and I'm not worried about that because that's what helps keep me safer. Now as I'm writing you this letter, Fox News just reported that CTF central has the highest confirmed positive COVID19 cases out of 33 California state prison, 714 cases. They have also started putting 26 tents on their recreation yards.</br></br>

So I was allowed at least two hours of yard every four to five days. I don’t know if CDCR will even allow inmates out to the yard anymore due to the COVID19 isolation tents on the yard now. So it is getting worse by the minute. Our family members came out this weekend and protested in front of CTF Soledad, asking CDCR to release those of us that have health issues, and that are close to their release dates. I’m a nonviolent third striker, prop 57 eligible inmate that should have been released when prop 57 passed in 2016.</br></br>

So to share about reduced visits, it is very sad and can be stressful at times if I don’t keep a positive outlook, and attitude about it and everything else. I cope with this crisis the same way I try to cope with everything that I do not have control over, and that is to stay positive, exercise, and remember this too shall pass, and only focus on the things that I can control, my thoughts, feelings, and actions. Take care and stay safe, and always tell your family that you love and cherish them.</br></br>

Respectfully and sincerely,
