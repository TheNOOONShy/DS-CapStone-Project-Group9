Look, how are you dealing with this if you don’t mind me asking? From the very beginning, I have been kind of stressed out! My little cousin just had COVID-19. She shook it off in like one week, thank God! I think I caught and shook it off myself. Again, I must say thank God. I had all the symptoms.</br></br>
My taste, smell, high fever, and all of that! For like three days my Celly had it too. He had it for two days, and a few of my associates here caught it as well. They got over it also, thank God!</br></br>
I am a part of an association that is located in Oakland California. They advised me to file a Right of Habeas Corpus under the fact that CDCR Cannot avoid me from catching COVID-19 and I could possibly die if I catch it! And I wasn’t sentenced to death, you feel me? I also requested for the court to release me, and to grant me A temporary restraining order and eventually hearing. I am currently in the appeals court with it right now, the Superior Court out here denied my right, so that is where I am at with that.</br></br>
I want to thank you for saying in your letter, that you know I have what it takes to get through all of this all right. And I say this in an honest way. Because I have been locked up for 14 years. You know you looked me up, but you also stated that you may not know me personally.</br></br>
