Hi, PrisonPandemic,
<br> <br>
Hope when you get this, you're striving forward towards life with your head held up high and staying positive. I was really glad to hear your words of encouragement. I find myself, mentally and physically good. I just took the moderna vaccine. I just hope I don't go through any withdrawals.

About visitors, it'd be selfish of one to have your loved ones come out of their home and risk their health just so they can see you. I do not feel the stress of being quarantined. I have been cell living for quite some time now, so I know how to manage inside confined quarters. My time revolves around working out and reading and drawing. I like learning, and you mentioned artwork earlier.

What would you guys suggest I draw? I am very excited to exhibit my skills. With that being said, I leave as a came, with utmost respect and a smile on my face.
