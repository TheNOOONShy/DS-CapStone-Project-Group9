PrisonPandemic,</br></br>

First and foremost, I send my love and respect to you for taking the time to send your letter, and show interest in those suffering through their pandemic and showing effort on your behalf to help our situations get better.</br></br>

Unfortunately not all of those who you have selected to write are grateful or taking you seriously enough to correspond with the information you are requesting. I sincerely hope that this arrangement can become more consistent and something we can both grow into, because, to be 100% honest, this letter found me at a very pressing and depressing time in my life.</br></br>

You are in college? What are you trying to major in? You know, I graduated from high school with excellent CAHSEE & SAT scores. I was accepted to three four-year colleges, but my life and economic hardships drove me into the arms of the guilty streets of Oakland, and was forced to make life or death decisions. Literally.</br></br>

Maybe I can elaborate on that on another letter. All stages of this pandemic have had multiple effects on me. The beginning was tangled with close of visits and strict program changes, and visits is literally all we’ve got.</br></br>

Due to social distancing along with quarantine and isolation protocol, calls to our families became less,  and to this day, I personally am affected because I am a self-made tattoo artist, and my business has suffered severely.</br></br>

I have struggled to stay full on my hygiene and canteen because I don’t have a chance to provide myself with the necessities a prisoner needs. I can’t help my family so the least I can do is take care of myself.</br></br>

Anyway I truly hope I can elaborate with you more in the future and that we can develop a pen-pal relationship, and that your decision isn’t a biased one because I am in prison. Have a very nice day and be safe.</br></br>

With respect,
