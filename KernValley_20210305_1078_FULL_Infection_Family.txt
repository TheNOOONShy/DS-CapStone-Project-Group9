This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Kern Valley.</br></br>Dear PrisonPandemic,</br></br>Hi! I just wrote you a couple of days ago. I honestly did not tell you nothing regarding the pandemic and how it has affected me. At first, I was a little hesitant because out of the blue I received your letter, but I got the thinking and honestly, I need to get this off my chest.</br></br>I personally caught COVID-19. I was a critical worker when I caught this virus. After I caught COVID, custody put me on a 24-hour quarantine for two weeks. I was really sick, I lost my sense of smell and taste for like 3-4 months. I was having trouble breathing and all that.</br></br>While I was on this lockdown, I couldn’t call my family to see how they were doing since the virus hit. I constantly live in fear of re-catching this virus and dying. I’m scared. I don’t want the last thing I see is to is to be the inside of a prison. Imagine of living like this?</br></br>I’ve been incarcerated nine years now, so obviously I was in here when the pandemic hit. Not being able to see my family has been torture. I have a nine-year-old daughter and she has been through hell not being able to see her dad.</br></br>They were doing video visits for a couple of months, but seriously people were having a hard time to get visiting appointments. They were making it impossible for us to get appointments.</br></br>Recently, they started to let us to receive physical visits and they rules is just outrageous. We can only embrace our loved ones for a brief moment due to COVID.</br></br> The COs were the ones that brought us this disease to being with. They would touch us and be close to us when our loved ones can’t. This is unfair and it doesn’t make sense.</br></br>I come from a low-income family. My family has not been able to provide for me so I can go to the canteen because they’re struggling due to COVID.</br></br>I have not been able to receive my COVID-19 relief so I can help myself and help my family because I do not have mu social security number. To apply for the relief, you need your social security number, which I don’t have. Custody and no one else want to help me. I have exhausted all my resources and every answer is no and blamed on “COVID.”</br></br>I don’t know if you can or cannot help, but I would appreciate it if you can assist me to put my story out there so someone can help me.</br></br>I do not want to be anonymous, please put my story out there so people and the public can see what’s going on. I hope you can help me out with this. Thank you for writing to me and thinking of us in there.</br></br>Please help!</br></br>You be safe and take care out there. God Bless!</br></br>Sincerely.
