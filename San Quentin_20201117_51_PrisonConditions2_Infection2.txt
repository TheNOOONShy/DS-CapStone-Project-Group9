This letter was written by a person incarcerated at San Quentin.</br></br>

Since March 27, 2020, the people at San Quentin State Prison’s West Block housing unit were notified by Memorandums generated from the Warden’s office, the Medical department and by Institutional television channel, that a staff member here tested positive for a contagious and deadly disease known as the Coronavirus or COVID-19, and this disease has broken out into a global pandemic. Considering how I arrived at San Quentin, some history, the quarantines that I have experienced and what I see every six feet.</br></br>

In late November 2011, I was transferred to San Quentin’s North Block housing unit from Soledad Central though the Prison Re-Alignment Program. After a little over a year, I was transferred to San Quentin’s West Block housing unit. This is how I arrived a San Quentin.</br></br>

Well, what I do see in West Block housing unit during this global quarantine. First, I will describe the unit briefly. West Block has two sides known as the “yard-side” and the “bay-side.” Both sides are five stories high and built inside of the same housing unit. There are two people placed in each cell, presently housing over 800 plus people.</br></br>
 
Beginning with one of the orders issued by the Warden’s office to those placed and work at San Quentin is “KEEP SIX-FEET-AWAY from others while in waiting areas, showers, medical appointments, yard, etc. and wash your hands with soap and water for twenty-seconds, cough or sneeze into your elbow.” Keeping these orders in mind with the buildings structure.</br></br>

There are twenty-four shower heads placed about three feet apart, showering every other day. Twelve telephones placed about three-feet apart until the recent change, moving the telephones six-feet apart, but not adding more. This is the structure, what about supplies?</br></br> 

West Block’s housing unit issues out one bar of soap and one roll of toilet paper per person each week. Other prisons issue out double. Just recently two-cloth face masks were issued to each person. One twelve-ounce bottle of hand sanitizer was issued per person. One may ask, how are the people here fed?</br></br> 

West Block’s meal release is done by releasing entire tiers of people at the same time to retrieve a meal from the first tier from Housing unit porters. West Block is dimly lit and the roof is exposing insulation. These are some of the things that I see during this quarantine.</br></br> 

You tell me if staff and the people living here can adhere to these orders given. The way I arrived at San Quentin, some history, the prison’s quarantines, and what I see every six feet.
