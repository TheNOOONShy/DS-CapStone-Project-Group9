This story was told by a person incarcerated at Calipatria.</br></br>

UCI: Wow. My gosh. So when is the last time that you were able to visit with your family members?</br></br> 

Caller: Uhhh since January of last year.</br></br> 

And that, and that, and that’s through visit, video visit, whatever.</br></br> 

UCI: Oh, are they offering video visits? Or not even that either?</br></br> 

Caller: They were supposed to have it up and runnin’, but then they only had it up and runnin’ for like a couple of prisons. And then when they was ‘bout to run it here for us, they told us if you had, if you hadn't catch COVID you can’t, you can’t go. Even if we tested negative they said we can’t go to a video visit. I haven’t had a visit since at least January of last year, for sure.</br></br> 

UCI: Wow, that's crazy. That's shocking honestly.</br></br>

Caller: We’re allowed, we’re, sometimes we’re allowed one 15-minute phone call a day, sometimes it might be two days, or every other like it always switches up. And then if your day is not on a free day and your family don’t have money on the phone, then you’re just, you’re, excuse my language, you’re assed out.
