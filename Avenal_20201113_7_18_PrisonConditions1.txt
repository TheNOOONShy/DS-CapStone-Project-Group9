This story was told by a person incarcerated at Avenal.</br></br>

UCI: Uh, what do you think they should be doing?</br></br>Caller: Hm. I think they needa--I think they needed to be separating, grab all the negatives, people who tested negative, which was a small minority, and separate them from everybody who tested positive. But they didn’t. You know. They still have these people who tested negative around everybody. So, I don’t know, I think that’s kind of dumb.</br></br> And uh, they’ll test people on a Friday, and their results won’t come back in ‘til like four or five days later, which is like Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday. So if one of those guys comes back--comes back positive, the four or five days that they were left here waiting for their results, it’s like, it was pointless, you know? They were already infected, we were all still around them so, and um, kinda dumb.</br></br>But on paper, like I said, I mean, it looks good on writing. They go on paper like “oh we removed the guy who tested positive, separated him from general population.” But they just don’t say “okay, well we tested him and meanwhile, while he was waiting for four or five days, he was spreading the virus, then we removed him when we got the results back.” They don’t say that.
