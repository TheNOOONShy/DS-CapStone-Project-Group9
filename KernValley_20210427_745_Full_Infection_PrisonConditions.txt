Dear PrisonPandemic,</br></br>

First and foremost I hope this letter finds you in good health and high spirits. Well I received your letter, well I have a few questions. Is this like a pen pal program? I don't mind telling you some of my stories and experiences, but I rather write one person so it's not like I'm writing all kinds of people.</br></br>

On this website, do you guys see what I am in person for or look like? I don't mind, I'm just asking if possible I’d rather write to [redacted] cause she made contact first.</br></br>

Now as far this COVID, yeah, it’s crazy! I got really sick for like three days, I thought I might die. I really didn’t take it serious cause I’m in good health and work out. But it hit me hard to make it worst, when you get sick they take your personal property and put you in a empty cell.</br></br>

Then all they do is take your temperature. In here, it’s really bad, when one person gets sick, we all do. I have a lot of stories and I don’t mind sharing. I just wrote a quick one.</br></br>

Just because I wanted to see how this program works. I thank you for taking your time to write to me. It gives me something to do until I hear from you. Be safe.</br></br>

PS I would rather write [redacted] because she wrote me. If possible, I’ll share my experiences and stories. I just want to write one person.
