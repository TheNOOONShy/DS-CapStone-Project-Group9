Well, last month I actually tested positive for COVID-19, so I was put in isolation for two weeks. I never had any symptoms and I didn’t feel sick at all. And all that because I have a bad tooth that needs to be removed. I went to the dentist trying to get my tooth fixed, but you have to take a COVID test before dental will do any work. And that’s how I ended up in isolation for two weeks. Very frustrating because my tooth is still messed up.
