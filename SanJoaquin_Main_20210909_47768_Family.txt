This story was told by a person incarcerated at San Joaquin County Jail.</br></br>

Caller: There is nothing in this world more important to me right now than hopefully being allowed to go to court tomorrow so that they can release me immediately so I can race back to my children as fast as possible and give them the biggest hug ever because I know my babies – I know my babies well and I know they need that so badly. To feel – to feel that loving embrace that comes from such an eternal place within so that I can then begin to rebuild the foundation of the life they've always known.</br></br>

As I immediately establish a new place of residence and get right back to being the best father they can ever have. While taking all the necessary precautions to see to it that none of this ever happens again and that I stay vigilant making certain that I'll do whatever it takes to avoid imprisonment at all costs because I can blame this or that for – for me going to jail and say it's not fair and this is why, but I have to accept the fact that this is my fault. I let this happen one – one way or another. It could have easily all been avoided.
