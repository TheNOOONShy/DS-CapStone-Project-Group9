This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Susanville.</br></br>

April 21, 2021</br></br>

Sittin’ alone in some of the worst moments in time is when my mind finds(!) some of the most beautiful thoughts and words to express from my mind! Searchin’ for the truth outside of oneself. The truth was never found lookin’ outside of oneself, tryin’ to find it in someone else. The truth was finally found when I realized the truth was hidden right inside oneself.</br></br>

Negative thoughts and energy depart from me. Once positive thoughts and energy enter the hart of me. I spell hart like this because here, all of us, realize and feel the truth! And here I mean heart! That is where everything beautiful for me starts! Everything that can better me and help physically free me appears to me.</br></br>

Everything negative disappears from around me. Only positive things, thoughts, beings, energy can appear around me. Everything profound has found me! That is why your letter has found me. Broken minds and hard times, my minds and pens put them together again. Now they are beautiful people with beautiful moments that never end!</br></br>

Because you can rewind your memories and live them over again! Frozen in time with the truth stuck inside of my mind! Me not knowin’ it was there made it harder for me to find! Until insight awakens me. Far away from this place my mind has taken me! As my beautiful moment in the future will take her breath away! But she will still be here another day!</br></br>

Her breath away was her grabbin’ her chest, amazed because she never thought I would walk physically free on this day! She did not realize how cold she had been to me until this day. When she sees me and tries to cry, her tears turn to ice! Innocent but the judge still sentenced me to life.</br></br>

I thought they said only God can judge us. I know they lie to us so much, it is gettin’ even harder to find someone to trust! When the right words are read or said. They speed up the pace in your chest, now you are feelin’ that feelin’, life is such a rush. But no one wants to make it to the finish first! Numbness is the best feein’ you learn to feel.</br></br>

When the ones you love and just knew they would always be there for you. When you need the team most they are not there for you! Without numbers they will rip apart the hart of you! The truth is merciless, it just teaches you! That feelin’ you feel, that cold chill that speeded up rhythm inside of your chest is what happens when the truth finally reaches you!</br></br>

My pen uses these words filled with emotion to touch the hart of you! Makin’ forgettin’ about me hard for you! My mind is afire, it melts the cold harts of you! So she has no choice but to give her hart to me before it melts away! So I can turn it into a diamond and put it in her chest. That’s where you keep a diamond, a safe! That is how a diamond is a girl’s best friend!</br></br>

I prove to you my mind is ahead of this moment in time once again! Now the door that greatness placed in the future for me to enter in appears again. I have already done this before. I just had to come back because greatness made a bet with hateness to see if i was worth the greatness. If I was, I would find the door again!</br></br>

So that is how I know it is time for me to win again! As greatness stands and I applaud as I enter in!</br></br>

Thank you for allowin’ me to introduce you to this. The accursed poet and lack of recognition. Which is I. I am not sure who is readin’ or listenin’ either. Either way, I am happy to sare, I spelled that wrong! I meant share, my form of art of what I like to call “Conscious Thoughts” or what some like to call poems.</br></br>

I am in the process, did I spell that right? Well, I am workin’ on gettin’ my conscious thoughts published or copy written. I have written many because I feel I have a gift to express myself in a way. Most can’t through lines or words, but feel in the soul.</br></br>

You know the chill or feelin’ your favorite song brings, it gives me a great feelin’ just consciously writin’ things the right ones will feel and love. Because it will spark the feelin’ inside your bein’ and my thought is. My thoughts will make me become alive and physically free again. Because I have been.</br></br>

Behind these walls I call it hell which is a prison cell. Since ‘02 for crimes I did not do. But that did not stop the system from givin’ me more than four people could do in a physical lifetime in this reality. So durin’ my journey I have learned many things to better me and to help free me. The most powerful thing was to take responsibility for my life!</br></br>

I did not do the crimes, but if I would of maybe had better friends I would not be frozen in time since ‘02! So that released all the blame, like why no one is there or helpin’ me with my freedom! I learned the law myself, I fought the court cases many years by myself.</br></br>

With many wrongful things done, like trial attorney fallin’ to investigate appellate attorney lie and his mistake led to me not bein’ able to file my issues in the federal court! I have always knew I would find a way out, I never thought negative. What used to be crazy was when I would call my family or friends, they would be like, “Wow you sound the same!”</br></br>

At first I would be like, why you say that! Until years later, I realized they gave up on me and could not believe I still had a positive point of view! It was a cold feelin’ when you learn they really don’t care for you, how you would them and they knew it! I have had people say I am so special but a waste because I am in this place!</br></br>

The part that froze my hart was when know I am innocent and still do nothing to help. They say they don’t hate on them because they’re free. They say it is harder on the streets than in jail! It’s crazy, I am livin’ in a cell for crimes I did not do. And even with them knowin’, all they show is their back.</br></br>

I still have wrote them and called them with nothin’ but upliftin’ things that help their lives. I used to write them letter filled with my hart or energy on lines, but when I get their response it was like they did not read my letter or maybe they just did not understand my words. So the way appeared for me! I was goin’ to write myself free.</br></br>

And shine a light to all the wrong the system has done to me and also how these bein’ from my past and present really are! So I bring the light through my mind, soul and energy, and my close friend: my pen.</br></br>

With my mind and pen, I will make the right ones notice me, which will lead to the right ones comin’ to help me. Which then will manifest in my physical freedom. And with my poems or thoughts and pen, I will become known and my story will be unreal it will change this reality.</br></br>

Because I will show, no matter how bad your situation is, if you think positive and have positive thoughts and energy everything positive will come to you. It is just the law of attraction, did I spell that right? Well what you put out, you get in return. And I believe you manifest your own destiny. Which is why this moment existin’.</br></br>

Well I have enclosed some of my conscious thoughts inside, so let me know how you feel about them because they will adore you too! I just hope they allure you into wanting to read more! Thank you once again for your time in this moment. I will now write you your COVID story.</br></br>

Well first, just imagine you are livin’ in your bathroom! Just erase the shower or bath! Because the toilet and sink is present in there! Two metal pieces, one at the bottom of the wall, one at the top. Now put a thin mat covered in plastic. This is your bed. The toilet is like two or three feet away from the head or foot of the bed. Depends on which way you sleep.</br></br>

Now add a friend or not so friend! He is also livin’ in this bathroom with you! So you both are excited in this. Two grown men are confined in this little space. And the prison guards control the door. So you only come out when they allow you! Sometimes twice, sometimes three times, sometimes four, most times no matter than five times throughout the whole day.</br></br>

The most time you are out of your bathroom (or your cell) is three hours and 45 minutes. Most times, only for about two and a half hours. Sometimes two hours and 45 minutes. Sometimes you never come out of your cell for a whole day!</br></br>

For the most part, bein’ in a cell is better to me than bein’ in an open dorm. Because you get to be alone and be able to not be bothered by a lot of people. Because most thoughts are in prison of mind. Or negative or lies, so I like bein’ able to be alone sometimes, because it gives you privacy to think and not be bothered!</br></br>

But on Father’s Day 2020 was when the first COVID case, one or two, on the yard. In building three, they locked this yard down for 14 days and tested everyone; the prisoners and guards and free staff. They put this Q-tip, it feels like too far up your nose. Then they put it in a small tube with liquid in it. Then you just sit in your cell with your celly until you get your results!</br></br>

It could take two, three, four, sometimes five days. Then they just tell you, well when the COVID cases in here first started, they would just take the one who had a positive test out of the cell and move them to one buildin’. Buildin’ three and they would leave the other one left.
