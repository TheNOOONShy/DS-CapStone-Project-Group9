This story was told by a person incarcerated at Mule Creek.</br></br>

UCI: How are you today?</br></br>

Caller: I’m doing fine.</br></br>

UCI: That’s all good to hear. What facility are you currently housed at?</br></br>

Caller: Mule Creek.</br></br>

UCI: Mule Creek? Okay. And what has the COVID situation been at your facility?</br></br>

Caller: Well, it’s been a little overwhelming. They keep moving us from once facility to the next, and we are not having access to groups or recreations or Milestones.</br></br>

UCI: Mhm.</br></br>

Caller: to earn time off or visits.</br></br>

UCI: Hmm. How’s, since people have been getting vaccinated, how they’ve been offering vaccination situations at your facility?</br></br>

Caller: Yes, yeah. We have all being vaccinated, all for two shots, through Moderna or Pfizer.</br></br>

UCI: Mhm.</br></br>

Caller: And we are currently being receiving them within the last 60 days.</br></br>

UCI: Okay. That’s good. So, how have you been coping with the crisis?</br></br>

Caller: It’s been very difficult, because I haven’t had access to groups or mental health treatment. Or schools to earn college courses’ credits towards Milestone off to my sentence. Or we used to pay in DRP programs, such as rehabilitative programs, offered to CDCR for time, because you know, for our sentence, incentives. And we’ve been limited to our privileges, then our education, are due respect to the COVID crisis. It’s been a crisis within itself.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah. I understand. So how has this situation at your facility affected your loved ones?</br></br>

Caller: It’s been very hard on us for the prison population because we had zero visits. And, supposedly, they were suppose to issue us tablets, where we can have recorded video chats visitation. However, they basically, barely started within the last, since April. 10th, offering the visits, but they are limited to one person per visit.</br></br>

That distance would , we all had to have masks on, which is, we shouldn’t have to wear mask, I don’t believe it, because we are among the free-iller at this point, from I’m hearing on the news.</br></br>

UCI: Yes. They’ll have to lift some restrictions, they’ll have.</br></br>

Caller: We still forced to even though we’ve all been vaccinated, to still wear masks.</br></br>

UCI: Mhm. Hopefully it gets better as time goes on.  Go ahead, I’m sorry.</br></br>

Caller: Our stimulus checks’ been coming in in the form of debit cards. They haven’t been able, they haven’t been telling us about them nor processing them.</br></br>

UCI: Really?</br></br>

Caller: And they’ve been sending them back without issuing us check, or our benefits. They are charging us restitution on top of them.</br></br>

UCI: Mhm.</br></br>

Caller: Where they’re supposed to be exempted from tax.</br></br>

UCI: Okay.</br></br>

Caller: And they are charging us on tax dollars, you know what I’m saying?</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, so what do you say that your facility can do to make the situation better?</br></br>

Caller: Process, give us the opportunity to send our debit cards home. Notify us with the right top room mail confirmation, meaning we receive them, and give us the option to send them back or send them home, so they can process the crunch for us, our loved ones. You know?</br></br>

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: And there are delays in process for us to receive our funds, and some burdens on our families, because they are struggling on top of us. Struggling, and we’re both in a sinking boat with no hope. It’s like being sunk like a rock.</br></br>

UCI: And in regard to cleanliness of COVID in the facility, do you have any suggestions for them?</br></br>

Caller: Basically, they are doing a good job as best as they can to keep everything clean and sterilizing everything as much as possible, which I duly do appreciate. This is a clean facility up here, and since it’s  a new facility with AC.</br></br>

UCI: Okay. So what else did you want the people to know about your experience?</br></br>

Caller: Hold on, they are calling me for legal mail, so can you hold on for a second?</br></br>

UCI: Okay.</br></br>

Caller: Let me return my legal mail. I will be right back. Hold up. Hello?</br></br>

UCI: Yes, we’re still here.</br></br>

Caller: Okay, I’m back.</br></br>

UCI: So the last question we were on was what else did you want the people to know about your experience?</br></br>

Caller: That, a lot of our people are getting killed, dying, or passing away, or worse, or something like that. They are still doing that like I should know about. But they haven’t been seen lately.</br></br>

And a lot of people are leaving without taking a notice or paying attention to what’s been passed on from generations to generations and what’s new and up for running for now, between the crisis and people dying and losing their lives.</br></br>

And people stuck in prison that have life sentences, and being in a reform act, sorta speak, that they can pass away to the mandos, the Three Strikes, and the L-WOP. And an enhancement on top of that for violent offenders, that we all have a fair shot at justice and freedom in the community. Just serve our time just for our crimes, not trumped up charges that unrelated to specific charges that we’ re serving time on, which is our basic determinant, and only that.</br></br>

UCI: Mhm.</br></br>

Caller: So we are having very unjustice in the justice system, I feel we need to reformat for us, for inmates.</br></br>

UCI: Okay. That sounds, thank you for telling me that.</br></br>

Caller: It goes as far as people losing their lives, you know? That he spend the rest of life from prison for a mistake. How would you feel if you, have you ever made a mistake?</br></br>

UCI: We all make mistakes, sure.</br></br>

Caller: How would you feel if they told you you’re your worst enemy, for your mistake, you’re spending the rest of your life in prison, and you’re never gonna get out again? Because you made a mistake. How would you feel about that?</br></br>

UCI: Mhm. I don’t, I don’t, mhm.</br></br>

Caller: Or would you feel that you could be, a person could be rehabilitated. Yeah they suffer the repercussions for whatever they did for their crime, correct the mistake, learn from it, and say, “Hey, I’ve been reformed. I’ve learned my lesson. I served my time. Now give me a fair shot at being back up there.</br></br>

“Because I corrected my actions for what I did do wrong, and I accept the repercussions of the situation however. I corrected and being here rehabilitated, and I’m not gonna make the same mistake. They got me here the first time. Give me a shot at being, free.” Would you agree?</br></br>

UCI: Mhm. Yeah, I understand you.</br></br>

Caller: It’s, it would be injustice to say you’re your worst enemy for the mistake that you made, and you’re never going out because of that, you know. It’s, no, it’s injust because you should be, you should have the option of being rehabilitated and correct that action if you are underage, because you’re not even mature enough for making that type of direct decisions.</br></br>

UCI: Yes.</br></br>

Caller: The mistake that your created, you know? You are rehabilitized and we should go up that avenue on a rechange of law, so people do get another shot at being back out there and correct their actions.</br></br> 

UCI: Yes.</br></br>

Caller: Take that initiative to step up and correct cuz themselves are mentally immature.</br></br>

UCI: That’s understandable.</br></br>

Caller: Do you agree?</br></br>

UCI: Mhm. Yeah, that’s understandable. Do you have anything to tell the people about your experience with COVID-19 in your facility, or no?</br></br>

Caller: My experience has been somewhat indifferent, because the same people are being tested for the same results. And we’ve been moved around like cattle, and they’re not saving our bunks. And, so, it’s a big switch-up.</br></br>

And its population, within its population, within its own medical facility, they’re overbooking the lower bunk, and transferring medical guys that didn’t have a reason to be here out, as opposed to them not being medically qualified, and this is a medical facility.</br></br>

And excusing them from the qualifications that would otherwise make them stay, and transferring them out just because they overbooked the lower bunk, and there’s none available.</br></br>

And to re-assign, they want you to accommodate CDCR if you want to stay, which is not right. It’s the other way around.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: You know? Sorta speak, it’s like a quarterback without a quarter. You are halfway but you know. It’s up so, I don’t know.</br></br>

UCI: Well yes. Thank you for sharing that with me and I thank you very much for participating in the PrisonPandemic. That’s all for me today. Please consider telling your friends about us to see if they would like to call in.</br></br>

Caller: Alright, great.</br></br>

UCI: Thank you. Have a good night.</br></br>

Caller: Alright, you too. Bye.
