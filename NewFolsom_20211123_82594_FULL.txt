This story was told by a person incarcerated at New Folsom.</br></br>

Caller: Okay, now COVID hit, the year COVID hit, I think it was, what, last year? Last year when COVID first hit, I had a celly at the time, he was like in his 60s, late 60s, you know. And when - when COVID first hit, you know, it was well, when it got into the prisons, 'cause COVID was around on in society, but it wasn't into prisons yet.</br></br>

When COVID got into the prison, I had a celly at the time, and he was - he was pretty elderly, and we were cellies for, probably going on six months at the time. And you know, staff was getting sick, but they wouldn't tell us. You know, 'cause staff would just be like, you know, we'd ask, "Where the staff members at?"</br></br>

"Oh, he or she is sick, they're out sick," but we noticed they won't come back for like weeks or months. You know, so we needed to kind of find out what's going on. So once we got this COVID, so when COVID was finally being brought up and stuff like that, you know, that's when I started to be suspicious because my celly, he was, I often find him you know, having respiratory problems in the cell, you know.</br></br> 

And I have to, you know, help him up the stairs when we go out to dayroom and things like that. And, you know, I just noticed his health was kind of deteriorating in the cell because usually, we're playing cards, we're playing pin-up, or we're playing poker. You know, he's usually upbeat even though, you know, he was old, but he still had some pep in his step.</br></br>

So I noticed that, you know, when we get up in the morning when they come from, you know, when they bring our breakfast, you know, he used to get up and things like that, and I noticed he had just He won't get up and things like that. So I started, you know, being worried about him. So I told him, you know, "You might want to," you know, "See what's going on."</br></br>

He kept saying he was all right, you know, it's old age, you know, things like that. I'm like, I was like, "Are you sure?" He was like "Yeah," you know, "I’m old," you know. I say, "Usually," you know, "You up, what’s going on? Are you depressed?" You know, "Was something going on?"</br></br>

So you know, he assured me that it wasn't anything. So me being the person that I am when I went out, you know, to - I had a nurse appointment for myself because I'm asthmatic. So we get a checkup every now and then. So when I was down at the nurse's station, a nurse that, you know, I'm familiar with, that I’ve known for a long time.</br></br>

I've been at this prison for 10 years now. So this nurse, you know, she’s been knowing me for a while. So I asked her I said, you know, "Can you - can you, you know, check on my celly? Can you call him down for an appointment? You know, check on him 'cause I think something's wrong" you know.</br></br>

"Can you just -" you know and she asked me, you know - you know, what was going on with him, you know - you know. So I kind of just laid a little bit out for her, you know, and she's like, "I’ll send  him down for an appointment" and what not. So he gets a ducat and I was like, "Oh," so when he got the ducat in the mail, I was like, "Oh, you got -," I play it like I didn't know what was going on.</br></br> 

I said, "Oh you got a ducat in the - ducat for medical. You might want to go see, you know, just, you know, get a checkup just to see if you are all right," you know, but the whole time I was behind it.</br></br>

So he goes, I talk him into going, he goes down, they check his vitals or whatnot. So he takes some lab results and things like that. So basically, this is what happened, he didn’t come back from medical because usually program shuts down, like if all movement in prison shuts down, actually before 4:00 because it’s count time.</br></br>
 
Once, because everybody - everybody in prison has to be in their cell at 4:00 every day for institutional count statewide. So I notice he didn't come back at count time, so I'm asking the CO that's doing count, “Where's my celly?” "Oh, he didn't come back?" I said, "No." "We don't know who," so I said, "Okay" I just waited.</br></br>

So he didn't come back the whole night. So the next day come I asked you know CO, "Hey what’s," you know, "What's going on with my celly," you know, and he was like "Oh, he's in a CTC." I say "CTC, for what?" He was like, "I don't know. They ran some blood tests" and whatnot and they, you know, "Something's going on with him.</br></br> 

So he's, he's in CTC, he's in, what they call it, an outpatient unit or something like that. And, you know, so I was kind of worried so, you know, day after day was going by. So I finally got, you know, some information 'cause I saw another nurse that I knew, and you know, kind of was inquiring, you know, about my cellmate. And she was like, "Oh, he's in CTC. He had COVID symptoms, and they ran some tests."</br></br>  

And you know, he had, I guess, COVID symptoms I don't know if he had what they say he had actual COVID or he was having COVID symptoms. So I said, "COVID," so I was like, "Wow," and then I noticed, and I kind of believed in what they were saying because he got visits his family used to come and see him and visits or whatnot. So I kind of configured he probably caught it that way.</br></br>

Plus he, he used to go to group and things like that. So he could have caught it from the staff member. So I said, "You know what, let me" I didn't have any symptoms or anything. I didn't have I wasn't feeling any symptoms.</br></br>

So I said, "Wow," so I said, "Well, let me, you know, get a COVID swab and all that. Let me get checked out." Just in case, you know, something might be wrong with me 'cause I wasn't feeling any symptoms and come to find out I had COVID. And but they said that, but I asked them, I said, "Well, what, why I wasn't feeling, having any symptoms."</br></br>

And they was like, "Well, sometimes you don't feel any symptoms from the beginning, but, you know, sometimes after a while, you start feeling symptoms." So they quarantine me. So then there's a special unit on the way on the other side, of the yard is a special unit building where they put all people who, who have COVID and they quarantine them. So they took me by force it wasn't even like I didn't even have an option.</br></br>

But they took me by force and put me in a quarantine section, and I was quarantined for 14 days. They came every day, and they was giving us COVID tests every day, a little swab in the nose, and things like that. They wouldn't let us use the phone, you know, we was - we was completely like quarantine, like to the serious, most serious extent.</br></br>

So, you know, so now I'm thinking, you know, “Something's going on.” You know, “This might be my last day. I might die from COVID,” you know because I was dealing with a lot of things going on. On TV that we used to see, you know, that was connected to COVID. People dying especially elderly people.</br></br>

But you know I'm pretty healthy, you know, I work out every day, I’m muscular, I’m built like an athlete. So, I'm thinking, you know, "Maybe," you know, "COVID might not hurt me too bad." But I got through it, and you know, they gave me some medication and whatnot to strengthen my immune system.</br></br>

They didn't even have Moderna and Pfizer and all that stuff out at the time. They were just giving us medication to strengthen our immune system. So I made it through, I made it through the quarantine period, and then they kicked me back out to the regular housing unit.</br></br>

So when I get back out to the regular housing unit, I see my celly, and I say, "Man, what's going on, man? How you been - how you been?" He’s like, "Man, what happened to you?" I said, "Man, they put me in quarantine because of COVID because they said that you had it."</br></br>

He was like - he was like, "Yeah, man. They - they put me" I guess they had an IV in him or something like that. And you know they was, you know, treating him in the outpatient unit. He was like - he was like, "Yeah, man, if it wasn't for you, the nurse said that. You told me to; you told her to check up on me. And you know, they call me down here and come to find out I had COVID. I was suffering from symptoms."</br></br>

He was like, "They told me if it wasn't for" me, "Telling her to check up on checkup on me. I probably could have died 'cause, you know, "I wasn't trying to," you know, "I didn't know what was going on with me, and," you know, "And I was kind of," you know, "Being" you know "Ignorant to," you know "My health. And I probably would have died," you know, "My respiratory 'cause I'm old.</br></br>

You know, "My respiratory would have just failed." He's like, "Weren't for you, I probably would have died." I'm like, "Wow," you know, and yeah, you know, is you know that's - that's, that type of story makes me feel good because, you know, because usually in here it's every man for himself, you know. Guys don't really care about each other, you know. Everybody has an angle with each other, you know.</br></br>

It's pretty much, you know, don't nobody care about each other. That's you know, it’s prison that's just how it is, you know is you know, it’s survival of the fittest. But I have enough benevolence in my heart to, you know, constantly observe another person and see and actually notice a change in their behavior, and you know, you know, just something's wrong. I knew something was wrong.</br></br>

So I took it upon myself to, you know, have a nursing staff check up on him, and you know, I saved his life. The moral of the story, I pretty much saved his life, and that made me feel good. So that's pretty much that's one of the stories that I shared.</br></br>

You know, that's a story that I actually told my mother. You know, she pretty much, you know, said she loved me for caring about other people. So you know this is prison. Yeah, that's one of my stories.</br></br>
