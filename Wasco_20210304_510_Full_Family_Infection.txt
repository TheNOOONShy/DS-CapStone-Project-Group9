PrisonPandemic project,</br></br>

I would like you to know that I appreciate you for taking the chance and picking me out of all the prisoners there is in California. I'm 23 years old and to tell you a little about myself. I’ve been in here since the age of 14. And to tell you the truth, it's a little depressing being in here in these times.</br></br>

There is things I rather be doing than spending time in jail. One of the biggest things that got my attention from the letter I received from you was that you’re a part of the UCI team. I’ve been studying in here to keep myself busy and my mind off the prison. If there is anything you or your team could help me out with, to keep me busy, like advice, I would highly appreciate it.</br></br> 

I'm short to going home and I would like to be prepared and I would like to be prepared for when I go home and I would like to be prepared for when I go face this world. First and foremost, I still have to get through the rest of my time.</br></br> 

It’s been really difficult being in here with the COVID-19 virus attacking the people you love. It’s heartbreaking to know that your family is out there running risks and you can’t do nothing to help them because you are in prison. The worst part is that you’re already in prison and all of a sudden this virus takes into affect and from one box they just throw you into another one!</br></br>

But yet what can you really do? Nothing. The one’s with power don’t really speak up for us and when they do, nothing changes.</br></br>

Anyways, the best I could do in here is stay busy! There is really no way of staying safe from the virus because there is always staff going in and out of the prison. I’ve tested positive once and all I could say is thank God I'm still here.</br></br>

Well I'm going to cut it short here. Feel free to respond. I appreciate your time.
