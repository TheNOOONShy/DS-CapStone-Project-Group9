This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Valley State.</br></br>

I am writing about my PrisonPandemic experience. So right now I have been in jail since November 2019. I started out at Orange County jail.</br></br>

I remember watching on the news about COVID-19 and when it hit America. We had a big breakout in the county around March of 2020. That's also when I caught COVID.</br></br>

The guards came in my cell around that time to do a cell search and tore our cell up. Now, around this time no one was wearing masks and gloves.</br></br>

So two days later I got symptoms and went to the nurse to report my symptoms and they said I was fine and gave me some cough medicine. My symptoms at the time, I guess, weren't known symptoms of COVID.</br></br>

I had a bad cough, a headache, muscle soreness, and was very fatigued. This lasted about a week. Then my celly came up with a fever and was moved out.</br></br>

Then days later I was also moved out also to quarantine where I tested positive. March was also the last time I'd seen my mom and son who was four at the time. It is going on a year since I've seen them at a visit.</br></br>

They came to every visit until it was shut down. I then started to stress and my anxiety levels raised up so high. I also couldn't go to court for another four months, so I just sat there.</br></br>

I was then sentenced to five years with half time off. I came to prison reception. When I got there, I did two weeks of quarantine to be cleared to do to a regular dorm.</br></br>

I then transferred to main line prison. This is when it got more stressful.</br></br>

I did my first two week quarantine, then was released to the yard where I was off for literally one day then went right back on. Then I was on that quarantine for one month.</br></br>

During that time, a celly of mines tested positive and I was moved and started quarantine all over again for another month. Since November, I have been moved around six times. This experience is very stressful.</br></br>

I want to be home with my son and my family rather being here. I've coped with this time with watching TV, working out, reading books, and listening to music. I go home in May of 2022, so I'm just trying to get through this storm and wait until the sunshine again.</br></br>

Thank you for reaching out and wanting to hear my story. I hope this is what people want to hear.</br></br> 

Much love.
