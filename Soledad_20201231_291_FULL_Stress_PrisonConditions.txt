To the team at UCI, collecting stories inside of these prison facilities, thanks for getting in touch. It’s have been real hard with COVID-19 pandemic in CTF. It’s getting bad, but that’s everywhere in prison. With they have us with a other man in the same cell, and one of them get sick, it’s over for the next one.</br></br>

It is a challenge, but we all have to hang in there wherever you’re at. Medical can’t help. If I get sick that’s just it. I’m sick. I been in prison for the last 31 years, I been through a whole lots, I have seen a lot but not like this.</br></br>

COVID-19 is real, I lost good friend. Without God I don’t know what I would. I tell you this believe in God. It will get better. I pray and I believe. It’s change me.</br></br>

COVID-19 has made me see things in a whole new way. We should love and help one other in this times. We live to become better peoples. That’s what I have learn. What helps me the most is understanding what’s really happening and wishing the best for others that’s in need.</br></br>

Thank you. God be with you all. One love.</br></br>

Higher power.
