Dear PrisonPandemic Project,</br></br> 

I am 58 years old. I am housed here at California Medical Facility, Vacaville. Twenty-five years ago, I got mixed up with drugs and the wrong person. I have been incarcerated since then. It's high time I get my freedom back and contribute to making our world a better place.</br></br> 

I have a lot to offer, and stories of truth that will make you squirm. California Department of Corrections has had me trapped here with COVID-19 fast closing in. In the last 5,107 days, I have witnessed five or more men transferred elsewhere due to having tested positive for COVID.</br></br> 

Today my next cell neighbor was one of those men. For months we have been shared air, water, space, booth room, shower, and more. Please help me, Please!</br></br> 

I have been diagnosed according to CDCR health care system, CCHSCS, as having the underlying conditions - diabetes, hepatitis C, obesity, arthritis sovereign in my lower back and joints. I have undergone knee replacement, total left knee replacement/supplemental procedure of left knee. Shoulder surgery another scheduled at procedure. A much-needed RT shoulder surgery, another scheduled at procedure. A much-needed shoulder surgery to come when health care staff gets tired my painful tortures suffering. I also have chronic lung disease and fever.</br></br> 

I have suffered for years like COVID not believe. I do not know when or how my suffering will end. But what I have surely learned through seven years in CDCR does not care, even a little, for my life and it become quite evident that they did not want a good end for me. I need your help badly.</br></br> 

The surgeons for the most part, such as my orthopedic surgeon, he is great. But the prison after caring post-surgery cause such as waste of taxpayers' money and so much pain and suffering for me.</br></br> 

I am still suffering. With COVID-19 everywhere around me, I pray for your help. Save my life.</br></br> 

Recently I submitted an emergency grievance seeking COVID-19 release in hopes to save my own life. Enclosed is a copy of said grievance. Please help me gain release. Help me find help to those justice. I got so much to offer and far too much to waste away as a commodity for their crooked gain.</br></br> 

Please respond. I eagerly audit your correspondence. If you need to, please contact family members. Thank you so much.</br></br>

Thank you.
