This story was told by a person incarcerated at Avenal.</br></br>

UCI: So, about the people who are in your building that have been infected, do they just move them to a different building?</br></br>Caller: No.</br></br>UCI: So, they just leave them in the same building?</br></br>Caller: Yeah everybody, we all stayed here. I stayed - my bunkee tested positive. So, I stayed bunked up with them. Nobody moved. If anything, they should've moved us that tested negative, but they didn't.</br></br>UCI: Is there a building in Avenal specifically for uninfected?</br></br>Caller: Is there a what?</br></br>UCI: Is there a building just for people who are not infected?</br></br>Caller: Not that I know of. I mean they have a designated area now. Like if you test positive or something, you get quarantined for two weeks. But at the time if you had tested positive, yeah, they would move you out for two weeks. Now they do.</br></br>It's hard to move you to a yard when everybody's infected. So, what's the whole point of moving because you're just going to move and be around another infected group of people. That's how bad it was there. So, [unintelligible], the two, the little two weeks are over, so then it's like ...</br></br>UCI: Is there anything that you want people to know about?</br></br>Caller: I think if anything, everybody should get tested. Everybody should continue to get retested. Because everybody's saying you can catch it twice. And so far, I believe I had it back in February. I didn't get tested back then. But now it's already nine months later and I haven't caught it again.</br></br>And there're people that are testing positive and I haven't caught it. So, I really don't believe that you can actually catch it twice. I don't believe in that. I haven't seen it yet. Until I test positive, then I'll believe it. But until then, I don't believe that to be true.</br></br>UCI: Was there any - how many people do you think were infected back when in February when you think that you had the virus?</br></br>Caller: I don't know. It was hard to say. It was hard to say. They didn't do mass testing until June.</br></br>
So, if we was infected before then, there was no telling.
