Hello PrisonPandemic,</br></br>

Let’s see if I can help your project. But let me tell you a little about myself. I am 67 years old, Vietnam era veteran who is serving a 30-year, 4-month term and with some of the benefits in prison, which are very little, so I have 14 years left. Now to the question.</br></br>

1. What has it been like to be inside during this time?</br></br>

Lonely, ‘cause no person to person visits with family or friends. And scared I may never see them ever again because I or they may catch this virus. And that has already happened to a family member in San Quentin prison, that was my cousin, he was a correctional officer. We were really close, I miss him a lot.</br></br>

2. How do you feel about your safety inside?</br></br>

I don’t feel safe. I have been blessed so far, ‘cause I tested negative, since this pandemic has started and even now without any shots. And now, with all these new variants, I’m starting to get really worried about my life and for family and friends. Plus they have been moving me from yard to yard in this prison with different inmates.</br></br>  

With some of them having this COVID virus. It’s so scary, I feel it’s almost like this prison or CDC wants us to get sick and die.</br></br> 

3. And how have you been coping with this crisis?</br></br>

I am a God-fearing man. So with faith and prayer, I’m hoping my Lord God, if it will be his will, to not take me home just yet.</br></br>

I hope this will help you, PrisonPandemic!</br></br>

PS, God bless you!</br></br>

Yours truly
