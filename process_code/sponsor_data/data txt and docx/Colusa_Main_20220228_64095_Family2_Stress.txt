This story was told by a person incarcerated at Colusa County Jail.</br></br>

CI: Definitely, yeah. And while I’m in, first off I just want to say, you know, I’m really sorry for your loss. You know, I can only imagine what you’re going through.</br></br> 

You know, it’s definitely always hard when, you know, someone - when you lose someone that you - you’re close to, and it’s one of your close family relatives. So, you know, I just want to say again, I’m sorry for your loss man, and if I could ask you a little bit of follow up questions, if that’s okay with you?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, that’s fine.</br></br> 

UCI: All right cool. You know, you were talking about your dad and how he, you know, the guard kinda pulled you aside and told you the story. How did you cope with that crisis after he told you?</br></br>

Caller: It was kind painful, it, like - I don’t know. I came back into the cell and I’m in an eight man cell so like - I was just like - I told - they were like, “What’s wrong?” I was like, “Bro, my dad just died,” and they wanted me to call my aunt, so I called my aunt and I couldn’t even talk to my aunt. 'Cause like I was, I was in tears, so I was just.</br></br> 

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>

Caller: Like bawling. I was just like, “Oh my God, what am I going to do? Where am I going to go now when I get out?”</br></br> 

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>

Caller: “What am I going to do?" Like, "What’s my life going to be like when I get out?” So it’s just like, I think about that constantly. Every day, every night.</br></br> 

Like, my dad was my everything, that’s who I lived with. And it - I don’t know what I’m gonna do when I get out, you know?</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br> 

Caller: I'm [redacted] years old and I should be doing the right thing but I just chose to hang out with the wrong type of people.</br></br> 

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>

Caller: I got into trouble and that’s why I ended up in here. And then, they came in here and told me that, so it’s like it goes and it comes and it, and it goes and it comes, it’s just, it’s just hard, hard for me to, to accept it. Because he - I was on the phone with him and he was like, he was coughing and talking about, “Oh I got bronchitis, I’m sick,” da da da da da. And I was like, “Well, why don’t you go to a hospital?”</br></br> 

He’s all, “Son, I will go to the hospital.” I said, “Go now.” He said, well - he said, “I got, I got an appointment with them in about a week.” Well, three days later, that’s when it the sergeant came to me and he’s like, “Hey, they found your dad dead.”</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm. Wow. And you said he had already scheduled his appointment, but unfortunately, he was - you know, he died during - while waiting for his appointment?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah. Yeah.</br></br> 

UCI: Wow, man. I’m sorry to hear that and, you know, I can’t - I’m honestly speechless because - you know, it’s - I feel like there should be more resources for people to help out. You know, that are kinda going through stuff, like a little more harder than others with COVID.</br></br>

You know, such as your dad. And you said that he told you that he had bronchitis, you said?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah bronchitis.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>

Caller: And he had just got like his second - his second vaccine shot, but they said that he died of COVID-19, but I’m not sure. I had my aunt go and do an autopsy on him.</br></br> 

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>

Caller: And I’m waiting to hear back from him, to see what the autopsy is.</br></br> 

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>

Caller: And, I talked to the sergeant and the sergeant was like, “Look, since you do have a probation violation out of [redacted] county. We can’t let - we can’t release you from here.” Because I only got nine months left in here.</br></br> 

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>

Caller: And they were like, “Well, since we can’t release you to go by yourself, we can take you.”</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>

Caller: So I’m just waiting to hear from my aunt and see when the service is.
