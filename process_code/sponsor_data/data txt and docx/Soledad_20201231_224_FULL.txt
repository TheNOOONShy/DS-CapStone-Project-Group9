Dear UCI Student PrisonPandemic project,</br></br>

To start with, in short my COVID-19 experience incarcerated has, and still to this day, is mentally dreadful. From being confined to a cell six by 12 feet (at most) with a celly. With no AC ventilation for a year now to being quarantined in the hole for lack of room. In my housing unit prior to quarantine, the ventilating system didn’t work, but just how it inner-connected each and every cell.</br></br> 

Left to right from first, second, and third tier — that’s how COVID spread to everyone.</br></br>

Nobody felt safe as nurses came to test us and/or take our temperature and vitals without changing gloves after every use and disinfecting their equipment. The correctional officers showed no to very little concern over sanitation protocols. I worked as an inmate porter. Which meant I helped in janitorial tasks within my housing unit and that meant feeding as well.</br></br> 

We were given one pair of gloves to last for the day.</br></br>

The whole unit would get a mask exchange once a week. That meant wearing the same one for a whole seven days. We were all even scared to shower due to no disinfecting in between uses. I know of many inmates to this very date who have not stepped out to shower due to that fear.</br></br>

In addition, once we test positive we get moved to another block, chapel, gym, and now they have tents outside yards. We get thrown with another sick inmate celly. Every other day we have movement in and out, those 14 days quarantined coming back at random from other parts of the prison. We’ve had inmates quarantined for two to three times already, too.</br></br>

Overall, and I know I speak for the rest of the inmate population, that safety here in CTF has not been present and regulated since before COVID. From running incrementals with opposing prison gangs population, to causing numerous riots and injuries to inmates from inmates. We’re all misinformed and left lockdown with no word for weeks at a time. Safety among this COVID is to refuse to come out and shower and skip meals in fear the trays are contaminated.</br></br>

Our visits were not reduced — they’ve been terminated. We’ve received no visits since COVID-19. They briefly mentioned virtual visits starting December 19. but to this day, we’ve seen no such movement for so. Because I’ve lost my only hope and drive, visits, it makes this situation that much more unbearable.</br></br> 

A great sense of discouragement to start my day dawns on me to not know how my family, wife, and kids are doing out there.</br></br>

Mail has always been an issue, and not a guarantee it will be delivered. As I feel this very piece may or may not reach the eyes of the public. It’s always weeks late if it does arrive. We have no means of rehabilitating, no visits, and groups. It’s taken a big effect on my mental state.</br></br> 

Lack of sleep, depression, weight loss, loneliness, and so on.</br></br>

This pandemic has raised a whole new level of anxiety, and not just to me, but to my loved ones as well. For which they worry about my well being. With all sincerity, I’ve found little to no ways to cope with all this. There’s almost nothing we can do in such a small crowded cell with a cellmate.</br></br> 

There’s only so many conversations to hope we tell each other until it runs out.</br></br>

Exercise is almost out the window where we can’t even fully extend our arms and legs hardly. And with having your cellmate restricted from moving and staying put in his bunk. With no ventilation the walls get sweaty and lack of showers, it's unbearable to even do the least of the most common ways to destress — exercise.</br></br>

An alternative is to write letters but to our dysfunctional mail system it’s a discouragement to sit and write one out. Tents were just recently put in our yard for more positives. And with the new year coming and vaccines available, it just shows us that we will not be getting vaccinated anytime soon.</br></br>

As of now we are California’s most in positive cases prison facility. With fear amongst our irresponsible staff, and no visits, to lost mail, we are sure to lose more fellow inmates to COVID and easily catch this virus two to three times. This is me after my first positive.</br></br>

P.S. Thank you so much for the best hopes and wishes. It really means the world to hear that and see people out there voice us and work to try to make a change! “If there’s a will, there’s a way!”</br></br>

Best wishes.
