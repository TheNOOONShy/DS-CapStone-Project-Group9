This letter was written by a person incarcerated at CIW (California Institution for Women).</br></br>

One of the questions you guys had in your letter was how do you feel about your safety inside? My safety is in danger obviously, I caught the virus.</br></br> 

I have witnessed messed up things in here. Some of the officers refused to wear a mask. Even if you ask them, they will not put one on. From my window where I'm housed at I can see the culinary docks. I witness every day officers and inmates not wearing a mask and when I see a few officers together almost always they don't have their masks on. It’s usually around their chin!</br></br> 

Times have been hard in here. Officers demand us to wear masks or we will get a disciplinary report. But they can be without it. It is not fair. On top of everything it's been extremely stressful to not be able to see my family.</br></br> 

I'm hoping to return to general population in two days. They have not tested me again since Saturday the 5th so my fingers are crossed. Thank you for letting me share my story.
