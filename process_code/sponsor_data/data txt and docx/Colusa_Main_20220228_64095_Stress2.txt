This story was told by a person incarcerated at Colusa County Jail.</br></br>

UCI: Gotcha. So are the, would you say that the correctional officers are kinda helping you a little more? Or are they doing everything that they can to help you out?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah they are.</br></br> 

UCI: Nice.</br></br>

Caller: They are. I kinda, I kinda like, when it first happened, I kinda like went on suicide watch 'cause like - I just - I didn’t know what to do.</br></br> 

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>

Caller: That, that was my - my dad was my everything, and my best friend.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: And my guardian angel, everything. So like it’s just like, I don’t know. It hit me so hard I was just like, “Hey, you might want to take me out of here. I feel like I’m going to hurt myself.”</br></br> 

And then he was like, “All right well, we’re going to take you to the doctor. We’re going to put you on suicide watch.” I was like, "All right." So I was on suicide watch for like a whole day.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>

Caller: But.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm. And you said you were on suicide watch. Could you kinda, you know, kinda tell me a little bit more on what that is?</br></br>

Caller: What? Suicide watch?</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, so is it - did they send you somewhere else? And like watch you? Or?</br></br>

Caller: No. They don’t, they don’t send you nowhere else, they just take - what they do is they take you up to booking.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>

Caller: They put this like, they take all your clothes from you so you can’t hurt yourself or hang yourself with any cloth or any clothing.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>

Caller: And, they put you in this green, I call it a turtle suit, but other people call it like a, some, I don’t know, I call it a turtle suit though.</br></br> 

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>

Caller: It looks like a Ninja Turtle's suit.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>

Caller: But well, they give you that, and they give you this thing called a taco. It’s not hard plastic. They put you in a padded room. All padded room, so you can hurt yourself if you bang your head on the wall, it’s kinda padded.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>

Caller: You won’t hurt yourself, and it’s just right up there where the, where the guards book you in at. And they - and they just watch you. Sit there, watch you, and they come up and ask you if you’re all right. And then you gotta wait for a mental health lady to get here.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: And then you go in there and you talk to her, and then she signs a piece of paper, you sign it, and then she goes back, takes another copy and tells them, “Hey, he’s not really suicidal, he was just feeling like that at the moment.” And they told her like, “He’s not suicidal, he’s never been on suicide watch. I think it’s just because it hit him so hard because his dad died.”</br></br>

UCI: Definitely, Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.</br></br>

Caller: So it’s just kinda hit me, like super hard.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: And messed up my day, I wanted to be watched.
