Hello UCI</br></br>
                                                                                                                       
I hope that upon receiving this you are found with good health and are enjoying your loved ones that accompany you! From my part, thanks to God enjoying good health and equally grateful for your note and your questions you asked me. And yes everyone fights in different ways in every life situation.</br></br> 

And my personal experience is that if we look around us there are people that are going through an experience more difficult than what we are going through. And if one has faith in a higher power in my case it is God he is never going to give us a load that we cannot deal with. So when I look at a person going through a harder situation than mine I say that this person has strength and as well if I can help I will.</br></br>

And sharing this experience with COVID-19 I have survived for now, yes I was hit with COVID-19 and it affected my lungs and thanks to God they quickly gave me medical attention and saved me. But if I am being honest with myself and other people there was a moment that scared me a lot. For the reason that I noticed that they wanted to save me now and the medical service ran to save me in a way that I noticed that I was stuck in problems, then a thought came to me that had never came in my mind before.</br></br> 

What is there to leave if I die?  And when I thought this the answer came to me quickly and in the bottom of my heart I felt that what I was going to leave was a big pain heartache for my loved ones and in that moment I visualized everyone that love me I do not have enough paper to write their names. But to be honest I wanted to die!</br></br>

However I am 58 years old and I have 28 taken from me and I feel that I have lived a life and in the deepest part of my heart. I think that there is still a lot of things for to do. And it is not just to live life it is to do things that make a difference for other people that need to, want to, be able to have that opportunity that is it is not only my necessity but it is a necessity of all human beings.</br></br> 

That we will feel in whatever moment in our lives that we grab to be ready earlier than other people, but early or late we are going to feel what it is to be human not to mention the reason we came to this earth it to do good! A special greeting to life up people who are at present in the medical service and helping others keep strong against danger and from those with similar mindset.</br></br> 

From the bottom of my heart I hope the best be happy!
