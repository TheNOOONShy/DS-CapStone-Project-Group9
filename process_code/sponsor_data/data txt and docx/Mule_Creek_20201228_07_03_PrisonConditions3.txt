This story was told by a person incarcerated at Mule Creek.</br></br>

Caller: I just heard Governor Newsom talk today about the things that they're doing and being very proactive in the CDCR system, and what he was putting out there is not what's happening in here, far from it. It's very, very poorly managed.</br></br>

We're being told medical is calling the shots in here, but they don't know what they're doing. They are not taking into consideration the human lives that they're impacting and the emotional and psychological effect that it's having on everybody.
