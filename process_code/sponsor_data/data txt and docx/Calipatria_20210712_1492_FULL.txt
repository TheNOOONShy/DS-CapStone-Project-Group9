Ms.,</br></br>

Greetings and salutations to you. I received a, I believe some sort of survey? In regards to the COVID-19 protocols here at my current housing unit! Well, I can say it is an ugly ordeal as all this COVID restrictions affect all of us in one way or another. I believe not being able to see your loved one is the worst part cause you can lose them in an instant to this COVID.</br></br>

All precautions are met here at my location to the best of our ability. Thank you kindly for reaching out, it was a surprise to receive a letter. It was nice, thank you. Hey maybe, just putting it out there, maybe you can help me out by going online to "reappeal3strikes".org and vote to have three strikes law removed, so a lot of us inmates can home to our family, sooner rather than later.</br></br>

Well thank you once again for taking your time and reaching out to me, it was my pleasure Ms. Kristin Turney. Take care and God bless.</br></br>

Sincerely.</br></br>

F/N Any of your feedback/correspondence back to me, I’d love to hear from you ASAP.
