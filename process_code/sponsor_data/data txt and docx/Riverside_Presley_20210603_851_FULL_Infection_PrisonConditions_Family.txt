This story was told by a person incarcerated at Robert Presley Detention Center.</br></br> 

UCI: So, how is the COVID situation been there?</br></br>

Caller: There's one man, he died I think maybe a couple months ago.</br></br>

UCI: Oh, a couple months ago.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah.</br></br>

UCI: Okay, so, how has it been like to have – well, how have you been coping with the crisis?</br></br>

Caller: They just had the vaccine shot last week or a week and a half ago, so I got one of the vaccine shots. And everything they're giving us is clean. We get clean linen, we get masks, and we wore the masks in here.</br></br>

UCI: That's good.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah.</br></br>

UCI: So, how is the COVID situation affected your loved ones?</br></br>

Caller: I guess it stopped my mom from working. So, my mom, she was working at the airport and this kind of, like, stopped her from working. And, I don't know, it just – school stopped for the kids.</br></br>

You know, the kids are going back, I think – or, no, the kids are stopping for summer vacation, but it stopped for the kids in the schools. And my sister, she has a few kids.</br></br>

UCI: So, what could have made the situation better at your facility?</br></br>

Caller: I think they're doing the best that they can. They're giving us clean linen, mask, and they're checking us every other week or so.</br></br>

UCI: That's good.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah.</br></br>

UCI: So, how is the vaccination been like for you and for other people?</br></br>

Caller: Excuse me, what did you say?</br></br>

UCI: How is the vaccination situation been like?</br></br>

Caller: Oh, it's kind of hard because I'm homeless too, so I just really came to jail on April.</br></br>

UCI: Okay, so, is there anything else that you want to share with us?</br></br>

Caller: Are you guys going to financially help out? Like, do you guys think that I could maybe give you my information and maybe you guys could help me out with maybe a canteen, some store?</br></br>

UCI: I'm sorry, we don't really help with that.</br></br>

Caller: Okay, okay. Well, that's basically kind of, what leaded me onto the call and help out and writing and stuff. But, if not, it's all right. Thank you for your time.</br></br>

UCI: Thank you.</br></br>

Caller: And hopefully I provided you with everything that you need.</br></br>

UCI: Thank you for calling.</br></br>

Caller: Okay, bye-bye.</br></br>

UCI: Bye.
