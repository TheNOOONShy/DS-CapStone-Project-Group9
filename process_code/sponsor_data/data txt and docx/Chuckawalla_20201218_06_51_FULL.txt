This story was told by a person incarcerated at Chuckawalla.</br></br>

UCI: So, tell me about your experience, you know, with the pandemic.</br></br>  Caller: Well, being an inmate, we’re restricted to this open living arrangement, and word had got around that, you know, COVID was spreading across the world, and we were doing quite well as a prison for the early months. And being in an enclosed society, we thought we could have, you know, been protected.</br></br> 

But, we have staff that come and go, and we believe that one of those had brought it in, and then it transmitted to some inmates, and then it just went through like a wildfire.</br></br>  I mean, in my building, everybody- I think 90, over 97 percent of the people have been tested positive. There’s been a few, quite a few deaths in the prison. But there’s been quite a few people that had very mild symptoms of the virus.</br></br> 

In a way we were quite lucky because it came at a time prior to this pandemic situation now, where hospitals are at 100 percent capacity. I don’t believe, many of the 250 inmates that did go to hospital, I don’t believe if it happened now, that they would have access to the hospital, and maybe a lot more would have died.</br></br>  Did the process, did the protocol of the prison's authority, was it well run? That’s very questionable. We’ve had, there’s our staff, our custody staff that worked in yards that didn’t have any signs of the virus on one shift, and the next shift they’re working on one of the yards that there is the virus.</br></br> 

And that happened quite often. Then you had the free staff that wandered, went between different yards. So, once it got to the prison, it was - there was no reason why it wouldn’t get to everybody. My yard was one of the last yards, but it happened.</br></br>  I don’t believe the medical staff really knew how to deal with the pandemic. They kind of panicked in the beginning. Maybe, unknown, not knowing, what the - how it was gonna affect people. We had people move from the yards to create a, from one yard to create a quarantine unit.</br></br> 

But I found out that a number of those people, those inmates that were moved, they were moved into yards that were positive inmates. So, it got to them quicker than it did to the yard that they were on.</br></br>  And some of the process, the procedures were very questionable. But that’s what you get when you’ve got the quality of staff, that medical staff that we do have here. But generally, I mean I was a lucky one, I didn’t have many symptoms so, even, even following the rules that were set, most, a lot of people didn’t believe, and didn’t follow the rules with masks, social distancing.</br></br> 

They still don’t, and that’s, that’s a mentality of the people, not just here, I think over the country generally. So, we’re - things to me it’s not as bad as it could have been. In a way we’re quite safe in here now. So, that’s how I see it, okay?</br></br>  UCI: Yes, no, we so appreciate this, and we so appreciate you calling. Is there anything that if someone were to, you know, ask you about your experience, is there anything you would want them to really, kind of, understand?</br></br> 

Like the main part of the pandemic, you know? With the free and open population, is there anything that really sticks out to you during your experience? Besides what you’ve described?</br></br>  Caller: Well, I mean, this type of condition we’re living in. It is overcrowded from what is the designed capacity of this housing unit. It’s been overcrowded for many years. They’ve tried to reduce it but this prison, this prison system is a business.</br></br> 

It’s a big business that makes a lot of money for the state, and the, and the economy of the state, and the surrounding towns. Nobody wants to reduce the size of prisons because of how much money it makes. So, and no matter what someone says, money is put forward to fight any plans to reduce the population.</br></br>  The quality of the sentencing that people receive in court is outrageous for the crimes that they have been convicted of. But that is what this business is all about. Now with the pandemic, that just makes it a little easier because we can’t social distance in here.</br></br> 

It ran through the every - yeah, we cannot keep our six feet apart. It’s impossible. You’ve got each cubicle, most of them have 10 bunks, they’re down to eight inmates per cubicle.</br></br> 

But, you, you know, you cannot keep, there’s someone within six feet of you most of the time. So, there’s not, you know, unless changes come to the whole prison system, this is how it is, and this is a warning. This pandemic, of what could happen in the future. That’s how I see it.</br></br>

UCI: Have you seen it where, you know, we talk about the pandemic and we’re very much aware of what’s going on. Have you seen this, though, with other viruses because of the overcrowding?</br></br> 

You know, just with a common cold, or the flu, or any other kind of ailment that is very similar, but because, you know, in society we can social distance. It’s practically very similar to what you’re going through?</br></br>  Caller: Oh yes. We’re offered the flu shot if we would like. A few years ago, I did get the flu. I was hit worse with just a common flu about three or four years ago, than I was with the COVID-19.</br></br> 

I had chills, headaches. I was in bed for a week. And the common cold, you know, a couple of people get it within, you know, a week everybody is sniffling or got common cold. So, it’s a common, it’s a common thing in the environment we live in.</br></br>  UCI: That’s - yeah, and I think that’s so important, you know, to address with the overcrowding right? Like you were saying, that’s a huge component of why you guys are experiencing what you’re experiencing.</br></br> 

As far as, you know, how your family, I mean, how are you coping with it? Have you been telling family and friends, or, you know, loved ones?</br></br> 

Have you been sharing your story with them? Or what’s been going on? Or, have you been keeping it a little bit quiet? </br></br>  Caller: I talk to my, a member of my family once a week, and I keep my family member informed. Again, if you’ve never experienced it, it’s very hard to understand the life.</br></br> 

This is a whole new social system hidden from most people in society. And if you don’t have a family member in, and you don’t, can't picture how the life is in here. It’s very difficult.</br></br>    UCI: Yeah, absolutely, right. And they even your family only gets a snapshot of what you’re going through even if you were to tell them, you know, everything that goes on, right?</br></br> 

So, I think it’s so important that you’re sharing your testimony. And is there anything you’ve done while, you know, things have been going on, is there anything you’ve done personally to be able to cope with, you know, a possible outbreak, for yourself?</br></br>  Caller: Okay. Well for this, for the COVID, I keep track - I listen to the news, I listen to what the scientists says. Most of the problem, most of the problems, the issues come with underlying health issues that people have. The biggest one is overweight, with obesity, and all the other underlying, you know, that they create.</br></br> 

High blood pressure, or diabetes, or even just high, you know, high AC1. They are the people who are most vulnerable to, especially COVID. So, I have kept myself as fit as possible, I don’t eat half the junk food that is available through the canteen, or some of the food that they serve to us, that I think is not very healthy. And I exercise as much as possible.</br></br> 

I walk at least, seven miles, at least seven miles up to 15 miles a day, every day. And I do exercise as well. So, I’m keeping myself fit and healthy to protect myself from against such things as the virus. And I’m, maybe that’s why it didn’t affect me as much as it affected others.</br></br>  UCI: Yeah. Do you feel like - do you feel like going outside has also helped, maybe, not affect you instead of staying indoors all the time?</br></br>  Caller: I believe we should have more yard time than they give us because, again when the pandemic, they seem to lock us all in the buildings, whereas we should be out there in the fresh air. But the trouble is, the people want to play games like contact sports, which ruins the, you got to break the social distancing common sense.</br></br> 

So, it's the mentality of the inmates. That, if everybody just stood outside or walked around social distanced, it would be much healthier for everybody.</br></br>  UCI: Absolutely. And we so appreciate you telling your story. So, thank you very much for calling, and it really is, we really do appreciate it.
