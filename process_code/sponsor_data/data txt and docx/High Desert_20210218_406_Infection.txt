It’s been hard. On the 12th of December I woke up with the shakes and a bad chest cold. I was pretty sure it was COVID since every one around me was getting it and being moved to God knew where.</br></br>

Sure enough it was and I was told to pack up and move to isolation. In insolation the nurses came around twice a day to check our vitals. Which was nice of the state to do.</br></br>

After 9 days I was having bad anxiety and my blood pressure was 240/128 when the nurses came to check on me. I was eventually taken out to the local hospital “Banner”. What was causing it was that a pain med I was taking prior to covid had dropped my subivm down to lethal levels. I find it strange that I was on that med for 2 years with no trouble then I get COVID and bam I’m about to die from my meds.</br></br>

Eventually I was cleared from isolation and moved, all in total since COVID I’ve had seven cell moves. It’s hard on us to move that much. Plus sometimes it seems as if they were moving us around in order to pass it around. IDK.</br></br>
