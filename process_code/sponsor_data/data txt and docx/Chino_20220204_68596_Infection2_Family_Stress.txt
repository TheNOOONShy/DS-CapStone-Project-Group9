This story was told by a person incarcerated at Chino.</br></br>

UCI: What has the COVID situation been like at your facility?</br></br>

Caller: It’s been like a living hell.</br></br>

UCI: Gotcha. Okay, can you tell me a little bit more?</br></br>

Caller: They have us quarantined up. They quarantined us a lot and they always want to move us around, man. Like, during, during a quarantine, after they quarantined us, why would they move us around to more people that are already sick?</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>

Caller: So I don’t understand why they move us to another dorm where other people are already sick there.</br></br>

UCI: Gotcha. So would you say they’re, they’re not handling it too well, huh?</br></br>

Caller: No, they’re not.</br></br>

UCI: Gotcha. And what about the vaccination situation. What has that been like at your facility?</br></br>

Caller: I’m, I’m vaccinated, I’m vaccinated.</br></br>

UCI: Oh, nice. What about everyone else? Are they also vaccinated, too?</br></br>

Caller: Nah. Some people are, some people ain’t.</br></br>

UCI: Oh, okay. Gotcha. And, are they giving you guys, like, good information about the vaccine? Like, what’s in it and what are the side effects and stuff?</br></br>

Caller: No, they didn’t give - nah, nah.</br></br>

UCI: Nothing like that?</br></br>

Caller: Nah.</br></br>

UCI: Gotcha. Okay, and how has the COVID situation at your facility affected your loved ones?</br></br>

Caller: It affected them a lot ‘cause they, they ended up taking some of my time away that they wasn’t supposed to have taken away from me.</br></br>

UCI: Gotcha. And so-</br></br>

Caller: They write us for bullshit-</br></br> 

UCI: Oh. Mm-hmm.</br></br>

Caller: They write us up for bullshit write ups and taking our time without us going to committee, without it being heard in front of the committee.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm. Yeah. gotcha. And, so, have they reduced visitation at your facility?</br></br>

Caller: Right now we’re all in quarantine, so we can’t get no visits.</br></br>

UCI: Okay, damn. And so, they, they haven’t let you guys have any visits or anything like that for how long?</br></br>

Caller: For, like, months already.</br></br>

UCI: Really? Wow! So I’m guessing you haven’t been able to see your loved ones for quite a while then, right?</br></br>

Caller: Yes.</br></br>

UCI: Gotcha. And what has it been like for you to have reduced visitation and programming?</br></br>

Caller: It’s just hard. Real hard, man.</br></br>

UCI: Gotcha. And how have you been coping, like, with the crisis? Like what have you been doing to kind of keep your mind busy?</br></br>

Caller: Watching a little bit of TV. Watching a little bit of TV and reading books.</br></br>

UCI: Gotcha. Okay, cool, cool. And what would you — what would have made the situation at your facility better? Like, what would you do to make it better?</br></br>

Caller: What would make it better is that they have - they would explain to us what’s really going on, and explain to us what’s — explain to us what’s really going on and kind of better the situation if they handled it differently than what they handled it, handled it like.
