This story was told by a person incarcerated at Salinas Valley.</br></br>


Caller: Well for me, the vaccines, it took a minute, because even the sheriffs took people out  there first so right here we had to wait, and as people getting sick we had to be waiting for the shots and the vaccines so. People getting sick in these buildings and they were moved to a different building to isolate them and removed them for remove them for us.</br></br>


But basically two months ago I got my two shots for Moderna, and I’m thankful to the United States who came out with this shot, you know what I mean. And I got my shots so I’m good right now, with that. And as for my family, well I haven’t seen my family over, probably right now, over two years you know cause they cancelled our visits.</br></br>


Well I haven’t got a visit, for a while so what they did in here, they create a, like a video visits. Basically like facetime, you could be able to see them and they see you, so they came out with that and they were able to give us 30 minutes but it’s hard to get an appointment for us, so I haven’t even gotten one of those because it’s so hard.</br></br>


They keep changing the application and we keep having trouble with that for a long time, and right now I’m basically, they’re giving us like regular, normal visits, they’re giving us like two hour visits. And you go out there and you have your people one-time and that’s it. They’re not selling you food or nothing, and they’re not letting in kids or young ones come in for the moment so.</br></br>


We waited for next month, they might come back to normal. I guess the whole state will be normal, as long as they do that, they will change it in here too. And this pandemic came to affect us in real life, I read the bible a lot so I believe in God and Jesus Christ and these things.</br></br>


They even, on the scripts of the bible, they say like times will come with infections and things like that to our lives because there’s things, not just us in here but in the whole world, because we don’t take care of this planet, you know? So I believe in the bible for me, we all did things to ourselves, to this planet, so we gotta take care most of this planet, so we won’t have no more stuff happening in this world to us, you know.</br></br>


And that being about it, and like I said because it’s hard for us because this happened and they locked it down, we’re not able to come out. At the beginning when this thing happened they just locked us up, they put us in our cells and that’s it. Stay in your house, don’t come out for nothing.</br></br>


They didn’t want to give us no shower, no phone calls, and they didn’t want to sell us no canteen, or nothing so we had to fight for that and push paperwork so they could start selling us canteen and let us out to shower like every other day or every three days and then give us a phone call everyday but it worked because we’re getting a phone call everyday and shower every two, three days.</br></br>


But like I said, sometimes these keep happening to us because there’s people in here, they don’t really care, they think this stuff is a game. When everything happened out there, there’s people that didn’t believe it, they don’t think, you know?
