Dear UCI Student,</br></br>

Well for the first nine months of the virus from Feb. this prison was doing well keeping the virus away from us then they started moving inmates from yard to yard in an attempt to show the spread. It was exactly the opposite result.</br></br>

I tested positive early December, had flu-like symptoms, sweats, cough, and lost my sense of smell and taste which I still haven’t gotten back yet.</br></br>

I’ve been incarcerated for almost forty years, it’s as safe as it ever will be. I have life without the possibility of parole so it really didn’t matter if it killed me. I don’t want to do another 40 years in here. Don’t get me wrong I don’t want to die.</br></br> 

Most of  my loved ones have passed away and they are overseas because I came in this country for a vacation, so visits are few and far between.</br></br>

The administration didn’t seem to have a clue how to deal with the spread, they moved guys multiple times which resulted in almost everyone testing positive. Thank you for your concern. Hope you are successful in your endeavor. Stay safe and healthy in these trying times.</br></br> 

All the best.
