Dear PrisonPandemic,</br></br>   
 
Hello. my name is and I'm currently incarcerated at California Men's Colony in San Luis Obispo, California. The reason for my letter is to tap in to society and give you guys some feedback on the pandemic in prison or from behind bars!</br></br>

It was sure a scare before the prison had an outbreak. But now that we have all pulled through when it hit the yard it wasn't what we all expected. Seeing it on TV truly feeds you nothing but fear and panic due to all the death counts they rub in our faces day after day.</br></br> 

I can honestly say that for us it sure seems that in these unfortunate times it is probably better for us to be behind walls. To be protected from all that virus contaminations that the world is experiencing. But as for me, I truly believe there is more to the subject. I have recently read an article on conspiracies and vaccines, and it scares me to really digest and accept what this really means for mankind and humans on earth.</br></br> 

I'll leave you with a thank you for being interested in the inmates's story and the pandemic from behind bars. Feel free to write back, and ask questions.</br></br>   
 
May God bless you and your work.
