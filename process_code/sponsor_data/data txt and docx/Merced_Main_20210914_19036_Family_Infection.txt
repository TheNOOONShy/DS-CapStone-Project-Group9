UCI: What has the COVID situation been like?</br></br>

Caller: Well, since I've arrived to this county jail, it's been all right. You know? We haven't had visits or nothing like that. But, keep in mind, our visits are behind glass.</br></br>

I haven't been able to see my loved ones for over nine months. It's been very difficult on me. You know? I got a family, children out there that I've been wanting to see.</br></br>

But, also, since arriving here, we had a major outbreaking of COVID. We're housed right here, in cell blocks. So it's – the first – it's five cell blocks.</br></br>

And then, the first cell's a 12-man cell. And then, our eight-men cell. And we had an outbreak of COVID.</br></br> 

It was about 19 of us were negative for the COVID and 47 was right here. It's been pretty hard. But it was – it's been pretty hard since I've been here.</br></br> 

It's had a total – a drag in my life, you can say.</br></br>

UCI: Mmhmm.</br></br>

Caller: You know? That's pretty much it.
