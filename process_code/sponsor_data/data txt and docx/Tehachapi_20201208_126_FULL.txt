UCI student,</br></br>

May these words find you in conscious mind and sober spirits. I don’t know how you found me amongst thousands of incarcerated men and women, but the intent behind the reason why you did it is admirable and pertinent. So for that, I thank you.</br></br> 

As for me, the most impact that COVID-19 has had on me is the abrupt stop of visitation with my family and friends. I don’t necessarily mind the prolonged “in cell time” simply because I am a firm believer in taking advantage of my surroundings and using idle time to get things accomplished. It’s the not being able to see my family part that gets to me, and not knowing when I’ll be able to see them again. The ending of this pandemic and all it entails is nebulous as well as unforeseen.</br></br> 

What I can relay is that CCI Tehachapi are taking measures in assuring her health is up to par. In their power, they also have on the institutional prison channel about the said virus that indicates oneself of the signs, symptoms, and preventions.</br></br> 

If someone has been affected, then that individual is sent to another building located on the same yard for quarantine and a stripped away from the little privileges they once had. They also limited the food we can purchase from commissary (specifically soups and noodles) for a short period of time, but now that’s back to running regular.</br></br> 

But like I said before, it’s the no visits that weighs down on me heavily, to the point that I no longer think about it, because I have no control of it. All that said, I thank you once again for what you’re doing in allowing me to be a participant in your historical archives. Take heart and thrive!
