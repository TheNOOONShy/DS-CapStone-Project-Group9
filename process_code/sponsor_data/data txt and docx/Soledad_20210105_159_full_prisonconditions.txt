This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Soledad.</br></br>

This past year was a rough ride for us all, pandemically speaking. We are all facing uncertainty. I don’t think anyone knows what to expect, especially us prisoners. We have all become victims of a virus, guilty of being vulnerable in every way that we could be. So right now, the world gets to feel what prison has done to so many of us, guilty or not guilty. It doesn’t matter who represents me or you in this case, we’ve all been convicted. Some will die for just being, and the rest of us will watch and wait, not knowing if you will be next, guilty or not.</br></br>

Thank you for checking on us. I can’t speak for us all, but hey, I’m good on this side of the wall. No tears for me and fear is a waste. Everything has an expiration date. Check your milk date. LMFAO.
