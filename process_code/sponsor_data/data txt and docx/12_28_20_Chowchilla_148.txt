My name is [redacted]: I’m sharing my true thoughts of my experience with the covid-19; @ CCWF. I wrote a health care grievance up against “Health care services.” On [redacted] Because on [redacted], I along with 3, other inmates (cell-mates) were being taken out of our unit + room and placed in a place in which I started calling the “Dungeon”, because it was dirty, filthy, rusty and disgusting in the “Dungeon”-building [redacted] on “A”-yard. I was kept there for 23 days [redacted]. For precaution I was told. On [redacted]; one of my roommates tested positive for covid. that’s how this started. We get down there and find out that there’s more than 1 person positive there’s several (16) at that time...unbeknownced (is that a word?) to our populations knowledge.</br></br>Anyway my 602 complaint focused on the treatment I (we) received while back there by the nurse’s, the technicians, mental health doctors. It lacked communication, it lacked compassion, when I would ask about my health and the chances of me contracting the virus since I’ve been placed in a housing unit for alleged safety with several (16) positive cases. And their irritated with me for being concerned about my safety. When health care fail to properly dispose of their PPE after attending to the positive inmates then yes I have an opinion about it. Which will cause retaliation from correctional staff if not careful! Keep in mind I had to place 602 grievances to both medical + security sides of it.</br></br>
Back to the PPE, they handle the positives first for some reason, they here they come to our doors to touch on us. When I ask them if they could change their PPE I get an attitude instead of understanding. They treat us as if we shouldn’t be tripping. My life matters to me, I love me, I am worthy of respect (I give it!) Committed a crime this is true. But I am not my crime. I am a human being that wants to live. And I know that the majority of society don’t care about us in prison, yet it doesn’t change the facts…”We are people” (human) we deserve respect + dignity like everyone else.</br></br>I was literally scared for my life in the “Dungeon of 503.” The PPE protective coverings they were wearing weren’t being properly disposed of. Sometimes they would use the red bio-hazard bags and sometimes they’d put them in our regular trash cans along with their gloves. They’d let the positive one’s out of their cells to shower, use phones, kiosk machine, all after we were done with our programming for the day. Only to come out the next day to find that no form of sanitation has been done to the location of these areas other than the guards sending in the receiving inmates in “orange” to so call clean. While I’m watching from my window (nearly 24/7) how the inmates in “orange” go in the contaminated shower get the hair out of the drain, spray 2 to 3 times with their spray bottles and walk out of the shower. I knew the so called cleaners in “orange” never made it over in the phones + kiosk area because the same trash and open lunch boxes, crumbs, etc. would still be there. So when it was our program time my anxiety level would soar. Scared to leave from my cell to go shower or use the phone (some days I would just bird bathe). I would be fearful to touch anything, so I’d go to the guards (c/o’s) to get some disinfect. because it seem like everytime it was our program time the disinfect spray would be empty. So you see just from what I’ve shared there was and is alot of room for improvement. With the understanding on both sides about this covid-19, “We’ve never met her before.” With that being said it was + is a learning process for us all. So finally yea! Hell yea I fear + feared for my life then and now! God bless us all!</br></br>
P.S</br></br>
There’s approx. 86 inmates infected here right now, I’m on D-yard and this whole yard and other units are on quarantine as we speak. They always have given us homemade mask, as of12/23/20; We’re worthy of N95 mask all of a sudden.
