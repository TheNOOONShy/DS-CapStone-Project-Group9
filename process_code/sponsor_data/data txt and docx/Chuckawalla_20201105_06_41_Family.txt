This story was told by a person incarcerated at Chuckawalla.</br></br>

UCI: They took away your visitation?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, took everything. I was expecting a family visit, as a matter of fact, with my two daughters and my wife, and we weren't allowed to get it because of the pandemic.</br></br>

UCI: That's - and how has your family been coping with that? Are you still allowed - I mean, are you still allowed phone calls on a regular basis? Kind of -</br></br> 

Caller: Oh, yeah.</br></br>

UCI: - describe that.</br></br>

Caller: I - I call them every day, but, I mean, they have their meltdowns. They're coping with it best they can. Knock on wood, none of my family members have gotten sick from it. My wife and my mother-in-law, my - my nieces, my nephews, the grandkids, they're all taking precautions now to get it and I've been really blessed. None of them have got it. Just me. But they - they have had their meltdowns because they haven't seen me. So it - it's stressful for the kids, too. Like my grandkids, I haven't been able to enjoy them or bond with them or see them. And my - my kids have not missed a weekend since I've been incarcerated. This is the longest period they've been without seeing me. Even my wife. So it's taken a big toll.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah. And you said in the beginning that you don't tell your family what's going on inside the facility; right?</br></br>

Caller: Well, when I got sick I didn't want to worry my wife. And she noticed it, like, what was wrong, and I didn't tell her. I told her I felt tired and I was taking, like, two or three naps a day and finally I - I lost my tastebuds and she goes, are you sure you're all right? I said, yeah. Once I got my tastebuds back and we tested, she's, like, you're going to end up testing. I go, I know, I'm going to be negative. She said what? And that's when she panicked. So I had to tell her and my mom -</br></br> 

UCI: Hmm.</br></br>

Caller: - going on. I just didn't want them worrying because people are dying and I - I didn't need them having an added stress to worry about me being sick or where it was going to go.</br></br>

UCI: Absolutely.</br></br>

Caller: Of course, like everybody else I just manned up and didn't go, but it was</br></br> 

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: - horrible experience. Like, it was bad.
