Fear:  the beginning of the pandemic, brought back to me an old and familiar phobia. The fear of impending death. It had been several decades since leaving the level four Prison Gang Lifestyle beginning a life of recovery and Rehabilitation since I felt this phobia. The news at this time was reporting that the people who are dying from covid had one or more of these underlying conditions: asthma, diabetes, obesity and heart disease. I have three of these four conditions. I believe that if I caught covid I would surely die. The fear of my impending death soon became crippling. I stopped doing the recovery and Rehabilitation work that would earn me my freedom one day.

I became consumed with watching the news and tracking the death tolls of the various states, waiting until one day I would soon be counted with the numbers. COVID hits the prison I reside in. It began slowly in another yard, but it soon found its way onto my yard, so those who were sick and or dead ran rapid.

The fear of my impending death took an all-time high, worse than the decade I spent in the hole at Pelican Bay. My mental and physical health was declining and if COVID hit me I know I would surely die. Then when my phobia was at its worst all my recovery and rehabilitation work kicked in and I remember that I believe in a higher power that could restore me to sanity. I cried out to my higher power and trained all my will in my life overâ€¦ and the fear of my impending death began to lessen. Over eighteen hundred inmates at the prison I'm at have been infected with COVID. I am not one of them. With the help of my higher power not to live life fearing death but to live life with the hope of being free one-day...
