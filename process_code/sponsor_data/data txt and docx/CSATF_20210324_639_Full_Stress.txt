PrisonPandemic project,</br></br>

Thank you all for thinking of us here in prison. Well, every facilities has been working on the COVID-19 pandemic inside their facilities. I been in three facilities, county jail, and prison reception center, and now here where I am at now.</br></br> 

Thank you all because you love to hear from real people directly from me and my experiences.</br></br>

What has it been like to be inside during this time? Wow, a lot of good we see, change and hope, and inmates coming back to God. And peopleâ€™s faith being used in this pandemic. I believe this has changed a lot of people for good.</br></br>

How do you feel about your safety inside? Well, it has not been easy, but it is a work that has been doing a little better. We just got to keep on work to better things for all. Some people got the vaccine.</br></br>

What has it been like to reduced visitation from family and loved ones? It has been hard, but thankful to talk on the phone with the free call we get because of the pandemic, because we do not get visitation.</br></br>

And how have you been coping with this crisis? Well, I pray and trust God and do what we been told to wash your hand and put on a face mask. I also do a lot of bible correspondence courses with prison ministry.</br></br> 

We do not have church and some chaplain have not been able to come in the facilities due to the pandemic. So I study a lot with my time.</br></br>
