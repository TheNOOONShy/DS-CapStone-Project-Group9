UCI: Okay, and what do you think would make the situation better at your facility regarding as with COVID?</br></br>

Caller:  Ask me again.</br></br>

UCI: Like, what do you think would make the situation better at your facility regarding, like, COVID? Like, do you guys have to wear your masks? Or, how is that process going?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah. Well, yeah, we're still in the mask mandate. But, various individuals wear masks in here. You know, very few [unintelligible]. I'm one who frequently wear his mask. But, there's very few, other persons in here, who wear mask. It might be one out of four, you know, who wear the mask. So, you know, it's pretty bad, you know, concerning.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, interesting. Okay, and so what else do you want people to know about your experience regarding COVID-19?</br></br>

Caller: Just want to go ahead and, you know, reiterate that, you know, I'm under the impression that, you know, a lot of the guys who are reluctant, the shot, is due in part because they're [unintelligible] stall tactics. You know, going up state, you know. Because one, eventually, you know, like, if they're convicted, you know, it's just a matter of the months it's over for them. Their number, time is up, time to go up state. And so, I'm thinking that a whole lot of them think, you know, they're not taking the shot, you know, or reason for them not to be selected to go up state.</br></br>

But, you know, they just recently said that those stall tactics aren't going to work because they were going to be compelled to take the shots up state if they want to take them up state. So, the guys recognize, you know, after hearing that, you know, there's still quite a â€“ who are reluctant to take the shots.</br></br>
