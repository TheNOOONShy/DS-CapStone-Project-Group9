Dear,</br></br>

Hi. How are you? I was a little curious, till I read the letter you sent. You want to know about COVID-19 pandemic in prison.</br></br>

Before COVID-19 hit, on around December there was a flu that was going around. I got very sick off that flu. It was very bad and going around the whole prison at the time. After couple of month we started to hear about COVID-19 from the news. I thought that maybe that was COVID-19 in December that was going around until COVID-19 actually came in a couple of month ago.</br></br>

They wouldn’t tell us how or where it came from, but we knew it was from the officer or a staff worker. I lost my taste of food and was sick for about two week. The only help that they can give us was to lock us down. So a lot of inmates was refusing to take a test, including myself cause I didn’t want to be lock down. No phone calls or anything.</br></br>

I didn’t think it was that serious till I seen five inmates from my building died in here. And one of the inmates I was a friend to. The sad thing was CDCR didn’t tell their family about their death till four days later. This is crazy.</br></br>

They give us mask once a week exchange and no social distance cause we have a celly. Two person living in a cell. Our prison “RJ Donovan” was in second most death 18 inmates total. That sad.</br></br>

Well, the crisis still going. We got the vaccine now, so hopefully that helps.</br></br>

Thank you for writing. If I can help in any way, let me know.
