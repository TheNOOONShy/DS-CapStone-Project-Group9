This story was told by a person incarcerated at Avenal.</br></br>Caller: I think cause for a while they stopped moving inmates. And then once it started to calm down a little bit then they started putting inmates in gyms on different yards. They started putting inmates in different buildings on other yards.</br></br>
And you know it just seemed like there was more of a likelihood of getting the cross contamination kinda that we’ve seen. Which puts not only the inmates’ health at risk but also puts the staff and you know any of the free staff who come out and you know the custody staff puts them more susceptible to catching it.</br></br>
You know when you have inmates from other yards coming over to your yard or you as a staff member being sent to another yard you know with inmates who you haven’t been exposed to or that you haven’t worked around.</br></br>
So, you know I don’t know I just think there’s been a lack of consistency and a lack of knowledge of what the World Health Organization and the Center for Disease Control has truly been trying to do. You know which is to stop the spread and you know it seems that the CDC has kinda taken their own interpretation of it and that’s kinda what they’ve been going with.
