This letter was written by a person incarcerated at CMC (California Men’s Colony).</br></br>

I am a 54 year old Black man with underlying health issues. I have been in prison since 1995, for second degree robbery. I was not sentenced to death in prison.</br></br> 

In March 2020, this prison, the California Men’s Colony, went on modified program. No visits, no work, no school and no outside contact due to the deadly virus, COVID-19. I have been tested a number of times for the virus in 2020, with negative results.</br></br> 

On January 5, 2021, I was tested. And on January 6, 2021, the test results came back positive. I have been in isolation, going through the COVID-19 symptoms--trouble breathing, chills, muscle aches, poor appetite, headache and dizziness. As of date, I have not seen one doctor!</br></br> 

The only thing that was done, the medical staff took my temperature, blood pressure, and blood oxygen level twice a day for two weeks. One person died who had COVID-19, that I know of here on my yard. I have filed two 602s, one medical grievance, CMC date of January 20, 2021. One 602 grievance, dated January 19, 2021.</br></br> 

I was exposed to the deadly COVID-19 and I fear that I might die. I was not adequately protected from the deadly coronavirus infection by the staff here at the California Men’s Colony. We are not getting proper care, nor are we being protected from the deadly virus.
