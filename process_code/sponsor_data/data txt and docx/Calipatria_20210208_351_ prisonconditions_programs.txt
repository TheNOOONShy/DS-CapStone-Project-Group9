This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Calipatria.</br></br>

What has it been like to be inside during this time? Prison is a harsh environment regardless, but the virus has decreased the redistribution of rehab programs, college courses, and all together learning.</br></br>

Our outside recreation programming has been significantly reduced and access to day room and showers have been affected. No day room, you either shower in the morning or evening. This is more like being in segregated housing.</br></br>

How do you feel about your safety inside? Truthfully, I feel better now that the nurses have stopped coming into the building to test us. The greatest potential for a pandemic or an epidemic to reach us inmates. It must come from one of the officers, nurses, or free staff and visitors.</br></br>

Every week it was like casting lots to see whose program would face upheaval. Or if you refuse to test, they threaten to deny you a package or freedom of movement. The violation of my federal rights were not nice but are now over.
