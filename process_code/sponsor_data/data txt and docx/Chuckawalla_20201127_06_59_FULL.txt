This story was told by a person incarcerated at Chuckawalla.</br></br>UCI: Thanks. So what’s the current COVID-19 situation at your facility like?</br></br> Caller: They, long story short, they shuffled us around whenever we became positive. Or even if we were negative, they moved us into different areas that were already in, they had put positive people and they never cleaned them. For example, what used to be the administrative segregation unit, they turned it into a negative area but it was full of positives basically.</br></br>  

The family visiting area is the same thing. They were putting negatives and/or positives together to try to get everybody infected. Long story short. And then on top of that they were not separating everybody correctly in order to avoid a huge epidemic within the prison.</br></br>  UCI: So, you feel like they were trying to intentionally infect the other prisoners?</br></br>  Caller: Pretty much. Pretty much. It seemed like the goal was to get everybody infected in order to get the program running again. Like they wanted to- they've been trying to get education running, and they were supposed to start it about two weeks ago. But because of not everyone’s been infected, they had to wait, and it seems like they, we were pretty much the last holdouts that had not been infected yet.</br></br>  

Now they've been infected, so now they can continue on with their plan instead of actually protecting us from the COVID-19.</br></br>  UCI: Wow.</br></br>  Caller: Yeah.</br></br>  UCI: How, can you kind of give me like a brief timeline from, you know, from March until now about, you know, with what’s been going on in there? How they’ve been handling it?</br></br>  Caller: Okay so in March they basically shut most everything down. They put a what’s called on a quarantine program.</br></br>  UCI: Okay.</br></br>  Caller: Where each building goes separately to chow. And each building goes separately to yard in order to try to avoid a pandemic. Unfortunately, it didn’t happen, it came in anyways. Right around May or so, three yards got infected, Alpha, Bravo, and Charlie.</br></br> 

All at the same time. Uh Delta yard was the only holdout until, for about six months until a couple weeks ago, when unfortunately, it seems like one of the staff members brought it in. And then it came, it supposedly came through the kitchen. It got infected in one building and then somehow it jumped to the other building because there’s a little bit of co-mingling that was happening that shouldn’t have been happening.</br></br>  And then on top of that, because of the lack of social distancing, they still have the buildings overcrowded, at 192 per building. When these buildings are designed to only hold maybe 130, 140 people.</br></br>  UCI: Wow.</br></br>  Caller: Yeah, so it basically was a recipe for disaster, long story short.</br></br> UCI: Yeah, it sounds like it. What has anything, is there anything, have they done anything good would you say? Or has it just been sort of bad all the way down?</br></br>  Caller: Uh for the most part, everything has been reactive instead of proactive.</br></br> UCI: Okay.</br></br>  Caller: So, for the most part, they only address it after the fact or after people die or after people really get sick or anything like that. Instead of taking the time to think it through and maybe consider, “hey”, or they don’t ev- they didn’t even take the time to ask us, what could have been issues. They just do it after the fact and hopefully they don’t get sued basically, is what they’re trying to do.</br></br>  UCI: Just trying to cover up. Yeah. You mentioned, has someone died at your facility from COVID?</br></br>  Caller: This partic- right now we’re on our third wave of outbreak, which is Delta yard. You have Charlie yard has one building and all three buildings on Bravo yard are shut down. And in this particular epidemic, we have three deaths in the last couple weeks. Yes.</br></br>  UCI: Wow. What’s, is there. What's the vibe inside right now? Are, how are people reacting to all this?</br></br> Caller: I mean, you know, a lot of us are upset. Obviously our families are upset.</br></br> 

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: Especially about the way they handled it because once the buildings got infected, they basically kept moving people from location, location. They tried to put some people like in education. They put some people in- they put some people in family visiting. They put some people in ad seg.</br></br>  So it, and then basically they blamed medical, saying that medical was in charge. And irony is that medical should’ve known better than to have shuffled and moved people. Especially, some people were moved around when they were in the worst part of their COVID sickness, making them worse.</br></br>

One guy next to me, he ended up getting pneumonia. They had him in central health. They didn’t even- they knew he had pneumonia, didn’t tell him.</br></br> 

UCI: Wow.</br></br>

Caller: And then finally when they forced him to move from cell to cell, that’s when he basically got worse and got to the point where oxygen level, he couldn’t breathe. And then they finally took him to the hospital, after the fact. Instead of saying something ahead of time.</br></br>  UCI: Wow. How- this all sounds extremely scary and stressful. How are you coping with all of this?</br></br>  Caller: Honestly, just one day at a time. I mean for me personally it’s been three weeks since I had contracted the COVID-19.</br></br>  UCI: Okay.</br></br>  Caller: It really took me about two weeks, to kind of regain a little bit of my sense of self, physically and mentally and spiritually. So it's just a slow struggle of just trying to come to terms with, how foolish of errors they made across all this stuff. And basically just trying to hope that they don’t continue making more silly moves that will continue to, you know, damage us or cause any more harm essentially.</br></br>  UCI: Yeah. Would you say that, you know, this sickness and even deaths and, in your case, were- could it have been prevented perhaps?</br></br>  Caller: Some of it could have been prevented, absolutely. You know, if they had responded quicker. In some cases, you know, some people reported that they were not doing as well, and they still continued to avoid taking them to the hospital. They did whatever they could to try to keep them here and avoid a hospital stay. Cause, you know, hospital stay is too expensive for them.</br></br>  UCI: Yeah.</br></br>  Caller: And yeah, you know, for some of these guys it was too late. By the time they actually responded and got them to the hospital, they were pretty much goners for the most part.</br></br>  UCI: Wow. Is there, is there anything that you, you haven't said that you, that you, want people, you know, who might be listening to this, to know about what’s going on inside right now?</br></br>  Caller: Basically the main part is that the CDCR is lying to the public. They say we have social distancing. They say we have space. In Chuckawalla Valley State Prison, we live in a dorm environment. It’s basically a warehouse.</br></br> 

It’s not really a, housing unit as they call it. It’s more of a warehouse. Like I mentioned before, the buildings really designed to only hold 130 people. They have 192. It’s impossible to be six feet apart.</br></br> 

You have eight people living in a 300 square foot area, for the most part, in most of these cubes. They're 24 cubes total with eight people apiece. And it’s impossible to basically keep your distance, to stay away. And of course, since COVID-19 is an aerosol-based disease, there’s nothing you can do to stop the spread.</br></br> 

Unless you actually release people from the prison and decompress the population for the most part.</br></br>  UCI: Do you feel like that would be, you know, what you would do if you were in charge?</br></br>  Caller: Yeah. But I mean the, really the only solution, most of the prisons that have had the worst outbreaks are dorm environments, like this or Avenal. And really, they need to decompress, especially the dorms. The prisons that have cells haven’t been as bad, like next door we have Ironwood which are all cells, but they didn’t really have any outbreaks because it’s only two people per cells.</br></br>  UCI: Right.</br></br>  Caller: Here it’s open so you can’t avoid it. It’s just impossible.</br></br>  UCI: Have they provided any like precautions like masks or any like or, you know, sanitizing wipes? Anything like that to help you?</br></br>  Caller: Yes, they did, but it was after the fact basically. So over time, over the last six months, they slowly, “Oh here is a  disinfecting liquid. Here is-.” Only about a month ago they installed soap dispensers in the bathrooms.</br></br> 

But do they freely give us chemicals to clean? No. That, that doesn’t happen.</br></br>  UCI: Yeah.</br></br> Caller: You know, all the things they have posted on the CDCR website, were all just lies. They’re saying that we had all this stuff, that was not the case. All that stuff came waaaay after the fact. After the prison had been infected and we had over 1,000 cases, when they started actually, doing that kind of stuff.</br></br>  UCI: Wow.</br></br>  Caller: All they did was, they wanted to avoid lawsuits and liabil- was install lines on the floor that say social distancing. Put little pieces of paper on benches and tables saying, “Oh, remember to be socially distant.” And, and put up little plexiglass screens between the phones so that we would be quote on quote “socially distant” when we use the phones. And that’s about it.</br></br>  UCI: Yeah. But it sounds like you literally can’t be social distant, right? Given the like the space you’re in.</br></br>  Caller: That’s correct. That’s correct. Yes. It's just too many people for the amount of square footage so social distancing is an impossibility here.</br></br>  UCI: Wow okay. Can I ask, do you feel safe inside right now or what’s- do other people feel safe at all, at any point in this process?</br></br>  Caller: I mean it, it’s unfortunately, we’ve all recognized the truth that, you know, let's say our immunity lasts for three months and three months later it can hit us again. For example, not really. I mean honestly, we don’t feel safe because Bravo yard already had it once a couple months ago.</br></br>

And it’s about three months later and they’re having a second wave hit that same yard again. So, I wouldn’t say we’re safe at all, in any way shape or form.</br></br>  UCI: Okay, thanks. It looks like we’re coming pretty close to the end- oh yeah perfect okay.</br></br>  Caller: Okay.</br></br>  UCI: I wanted to, if there is anything else I want you to give you a chance to say that. And also I wanted to invite you to, you know, make sure if anyone else has a story, feels like calling in, that they get the number and what not. Is there anything else?</br></br>  Caller: No that pretty much covers everything. Yes.</br></br>  UCI: I can't thank you enough for calling in and sharing your story. I really appreciate it.</br></br> Caller: Yes. Thank you for your time. I’m glad you guys can do this and get the word out of the truth of what’s happening, instead of the lies that they try to put out to the public.</br></br> UCI: Alright. I really appreciate it. Stay safe and have a good night.</br></br>  Caller: Yes, likewise. Thank you so much. Bye-bye.</br></br>  UCI: Thank you. Bye.
