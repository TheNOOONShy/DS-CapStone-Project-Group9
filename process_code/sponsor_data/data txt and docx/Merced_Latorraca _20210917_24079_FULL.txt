This story was told by a person incarcerated at John Latorraca Correctional Center.</br></br> 

UCI: And how has the COVID situation been like at your facility?</br></br>

Caller: Well, lots of times, they mix - sometimes, they'll mix us with people that got COVID. And we don't got COVID, and then they'll mix us in the same van when they're transporting us from the jail to the - to the courts. We'll all be in the same van.</br></br> 

Some time - one time, they raided our van our dorm with dogs and the dogs had COVID. And then almost the whole dorm, all of us all got COVID from the dogs. They really don't give us chemicals like that, either, to clean up in here or nothing, really.</br></br>

UCI: Mhmm.</br></br>

Caller: It's pretty bad. When I got arrested this time, just recently, like two months ago -</br></br>

UCI: Mhmm.</br></br>

Caller: When I was in the holding tank, there was about, like, 30 people in there.</br></br>

UCI: Wow.</br></br>

Caller: And like that's the most I've ever been packed in. There was like 30 people in there and we don't even - You know what I mean? Anyone could have COVID out of 30 of us. And they just pack us all up and then they just, like, mix us all together and stuff.</br></br>

UCI: Mhmm. And how has the COVID situation at your facility affected your loved ones?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah. They only give us one free five-minute phone call on Mondays and then that's it. We can't - we can't see our families or nothing.</br></br>

UCI: Mhmm.</br></br>

Caller: No visits, no nothing. They don't even give us Skype. We can't - we can't FaceTime our family, we can't -</br></br>

UCI: Wow.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah. We can't do nothing, really.</br></br>

UCI: Mhmm. And what has it been like for you to have reduced visitation and programming?</br></br>

Caller: I mean, yeah, it's kind of like - It takes a toll on us, you know? Like, well, I'm pretty mentally capable of handling it, but most people, you know what I mean? They don't - they don't even give us indigent envelopes to write our families or nothing. They just, you're just in jail and you don't get to see your family no more or nothing.</br></br>

UCI: Mhmm.</br></br>

Caller: Well, yeah. Mentally wise, I'm good, though. But I don't know how other people would take it, though.</br></br>

UCI: I see. And what do you think would have made the situation at your facility better?</br></br>

Caller: At least give us, like, in the dorm there, because I'm in a dorm with like 20 people. So, it would be pretty nice if they could just buy - give us one tablet so we could all share and all, you know what I mean? Contact our families and stuff like that. I know other jails they have tablets where they could, you know, FaceTime your family and stuff like that.</br></br>

UCI: Mhmm.</br></br>

Caller: You could buy FaceTime. We have- we'll even, that would be cool, we could even pay for it, too. Like, we wouldn't mind that.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, but you know, they really don't care. And then, when the guards walk in to do the walk-through, they don't ever wear their mask or anything like that, either.</br></br>

UCI: Wow.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah. Like, they don't - like they just don't really care.</br></br>

UCI: Mhmm. And what's the vaccination situation at, like?</br></br>

Caller: They offer the vaccination here.</br></br>

UCI: Mhmm.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, they do - they do offer it.</br></br>

UCI: Mhmm. Is there anything else you want people to know about your experience?</br></br>

Caller: Other than they give us diluted chemicals all the time. They don't - they haven't offered us anything, really. Like, they don't offer us no towels to clean, nothing.</br></br>

They don't offer us no good chemicals to clean anything. They don't offer us any soaps. We have to buy all our soaps. They - they only wash our clothes one time a week. Other than that, you know, we're just - we're just living in a dirty place.</br></br>

UCI: Mhmm.</br></br>

Caller: Mhmm. Unbearable environment. And then they keep our family from us, too, which is - I don't think that's right, either. You know, at least - at least they should - at least they should give us the tablet so we could FaceTime our families, at least. If we can't get visits.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: That's about it, I mean. I don't know. I just called you guys just to let you know what's going on, really, though.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah. Thank you so much for reaching out.</br></br>

Caller: When I was in Solano, the - the pandemic first came out. It was basically like the same thing. They really didn't do nothing, either. All they did was give us four orange masks. All they did was give us four little, orange masks and that was it.</br></br>

UCI: Wow. For the entirety of your stay there?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah. Well, I was only there for, I got out early that time. I got out early, but that's when the pandemic first came out last year, like around July. And then, all I remember is them giving us four masks. And then, really, there was no - there was only so much they could do about social distancing.</br></br>

And they got us in this - well, yeah, that's all they really did. That's all I could really remember.</br></br>

But in the dorm that - in the dorm I'm in right now, we only got, there's 20 people and we only got one phone. One phone for all of us to use. There's only one toilet for 20 people to use. The other toilet is broken.</br></br>

They never did nothing about it. The urinal is broken. I remember one time, I was in the jail for three months, taking a shower in cold showers. Literally in cold showers for three months straight.</br></br>

UCI: Wow.</br></br>

Caller: Like, literally, we had just cold, like five minutes just to take a shower real quick and jump out because it's so cold.</br></br>

UCI: Mhmm.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, that's about it, though.</br></br>

UCI: Mhmm. Well, thank you very much for participating in PrisonPandemic and please consider telling your friends about us and seeing if they would like to call in.</br></br>

Caller: I will. Thank you.</br></br>

UCI: All right. Take care.
