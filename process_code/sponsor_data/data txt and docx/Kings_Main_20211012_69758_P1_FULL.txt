This story was told by a person incarcerated at Kings County Jail.</br></br>

UCI: All right. So, I know you already started your story with the other–</br></br>

Caller: I know you guys are aware you know, so far, of where I'm at, so you want me to pick up where I left off or do you have any questions?</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, exactly. Just pick up where you left off if you already are in the groove.</br></br>

Caller: All right. Yeah, I was just touching bases on, I guess, well, just the prison, just the way that we, people interact with each other, the deputies, correctional officers. It's – it’s imperative.</br></br>

I'm not wanting to sit there and point fingers of they’re doing this, they’re doing that cause you know it – it was said to me that you know when you point the blame at other people, you know – stop pointing the blame on other people basically because I have my own faults, you know?</br></br>

Who am I? I was just telling her that you know none of us are faultless. None of us are without fault, you know? So it’s – it’s – it's things that I want to bring to the light, though.</br></br> 

I - even my behavior, things that I struggle with, you know. It's real, you know? It's real the things I struggle with. It’s real, you know?</br></br>

It's something that – that you know – it’s nothing that can't be – you know – corrected or and — and worked on, you know? But it’s – I think we all have a - you know – I think we all have a, you know, me personally, I think we have a duty to come together and just - just, you know, try to help each other.</br></br> 

In here, you know, I've had times where I had outbursts, talked to some of the staff members in a way that wasn't appropriate cause I was upset. I was upset and I felt — I felt overwhelmed. I felt like people weren't hearing me; people weren't listening.</br></br>

More so I guess I kinda hold them, you know? I was – I was blaming them – blaming a lot of people for things that I had going on, but in a place like this, you wanna, it just – they have a tendency, like I was telling her, you have a tendency to be complacent and just talk to people in a rude way, you know?</br></br>

When they want you to do something or they ask you to do something, sometimes the person gets tired, they don't want to keep having to repeat themselves – themselves to you, and then they’ll – so they'll yell at you or they’ll, you know, talk to you in a way of – you know – "Get your F'ing"; you know, F word and stuff like that.</br></br>

Yesterday, they were asking people to go to the – go to the yard, you know, because they were doing searches, you know? And the senior deputy, you know, talked to a gentleman in a disrespectful voice, in a disrespectful way.</br></br> 

That wasn't necessary, you know? Cussed at him and yelled – yelled at him in like – like if he was – he was just garbage, you know? You can’t, you can’t – I mean, you can, you can do anything you want to, but it's not right to talk to people in that – in that way.</br></br>

Because there's nothing that we can — that you can do – that we can do as incarcerated, there’s nothing that we can do to these – to these deputies or people that work here when they talk to us in this way. There’s nothing that you can – you can file a grievance, but nothing really – nothing is gonna happen from it. Nothing is gonna come from it, you know?</br></br>

But when we do something – say something disrespectful to them, or use the wrong terminology, or say something off the wall, you know? They'll write us up. They'll take our dayroom time, take our yard, you know? They'll take things from us.</br></br>

What are you taking from them? What happens to them? Nothing, you know? So, you're kind of like in a lose-lose situation.</br></br>

There's nothing you can do but just take the – take the verbal abuse, take mental abuse. And to some of us – there’s some of those that have mental health issues, and some people can't handle that. And that's the honest to God truth.</br></br> 

Some people can't handle that. Some people will snap, you know? Some people will snap, and – and it'll cause them to act out, cause them to be violent, you know? Or, you know, it’ll cause them to be depressed for whatever they may have been through or whatever their mental health issue is.</br></br>

So, the people that work here, the deputies, they're not mindful of that. They – they talk to you in ways that – that it’s not right, you know? So it’s just – that right there in itself, you know, when you tell a person that – that things are affecting you, things are bothering you; like me, I'm in a cell. I tell them, I said, "It's – it’s affecting me."</br></br>

You know, it's a small community, so the deputies that work here, the nurses that work here, staff that work here, they’re – they’re, they have the knowledge and understanding of what's been going on recently in my life outside of here. Out there, how I’ve been acting – I was on drugs. I was addicted to drugs for a while, you know? And they're aware.</br></br>

It's a small town. It's a small community, so everybody knows everybody. I went to school with a lot of people that work here. I knew people here before, you know, when you're younger, in college, you know? I dated people – a couple women that work here in the past, you know, a long time ago, you know?</br></br>

But you come to — you come to a point, you know, to where like, “Man!” You know? It’s obvious I'm bringing things up to you and telling you what the cell is doing to me.</br></br> 

It’s affecting me. It’s affecting me to where – you know, I tell people this, you know, when I get out, I’m in that cell – I'm just cooped up in that cell like that, you know?</br></br> 

I said, “When you gonna give me a chance – let me on the dayroom floor, you know? Let me get – get out, you know, and have some freedom, you know?”</br></br> 

Because being in that cell, you're just living in your – you’re in your own head. You know, sometimes you can get in your own head, and – and it's not good, you know?</br></br>

I go out there to – to society, and it's affecting me. It's affecting me in communicating with - with people, my community members. It's affecting me in my – in relationships or lack thereof, you know? It's affecting me in communicating with people at work sites, you know?</br></br> 

I can’t even – it’s cause I've been out of this – I’ve been out of this for so long. I've been in and out, in and out, in and out; always over some dumb — this stuff that make no sense, you know? All behind drugs, you know?</br></br>

When I was out recently, you know, it was kinda, it was difficult – it was difficult, because I was – I was under the influence, and I'm trying to get assistance. I'm trying to get help.</br></br>

At the same thing – at the same time, the way I'm going about things is not – it could be done better, but I was under the influence, you know? I'm trying to seek help. I’m trying to – I was going to the mental health. I went to mental – here in King County Jail.</br></br>

I'm going to certain places, and certain places are requiring – are requiring a phone, you know? And I can't get – I can’t use the phone because I don't have a phone of my own, you know? I'm using other people's phones and I’m just doing – I was just a mess.</br></br> 

I'll submit. I ain’t gonna lie. I was a mess, you know? But when you're a mess, you know, and you're looking for help and you’re trying to get help, that's when you should be able to find it.</br></br>

You should be able to get help. You should be able to get assistance. When you're a mess, and you know that you're a mess, and you ask for help, and you're trying to seek help; man, that's – that’s when a person should come, you know?</br></br> 

And give you the help that you need, you know? Programs. Give you assistance, you know? </br></br>

I reached out, tried to ask the parole probation officer for – for assistance. That's what parole is for, you know? They're there. They have resources. They have assistance.</br></br> 

I got out of prison, ma'am, and you know – look, I'm right back in jail. And look, you know, it's been happening and ongoing, you know? Ongoing, you know? It - it sucks.</br></br>

And I admit to them – I asked them for a program. I asked them for a program to get into a program to give me – so I can get some vocational trades. The skills that I have acquired just throughout the years, just, you know, make them known.</br></br> 

Just – maybe I can hone in on those and – and sharpen them. And things that I haven't learned, that I haven’t – that I don't know, I can learn, you know? You know, like I said, a vocational trade.</br></br>

There's programs that have counseling, that have mental health, that have, you know, job readiness on — on-site – on hand. I mean, they have all these different things and all – and these programs – different programs in different cities, different states, you know?</br></br>

Programs that I don't qualify for here because of whatever past charges or whatever past charge or whatever; you know, cause on parole, certain programs are only for parolees or don't accept this, well you know what?</br></br> 

There's programs in different cities, different states because they have a wide range of – variety of different things because it’s a lot bigger – the population’s a lot bigger, you know? So, how about something like that, you know?</br></br>

But, you know it’s – it’s – I feel it's – it’s not right, you know? It’s – I – I pray to God about this all the time, you know? Let me – let me get help.</br></br> 

I've never had a program. I've been in and out of this court system, in this process since 2008. From 2008 to 2021, in and out, in and out, in and out, in and out, you know?</br></br>

It's not as if I – you don’t – I’m a – I'm an idiot, you know? I graduated. I got my diploma, you know? Played football, you know? I was a star at one point in one time.</br></br> 

Very good – very good in football, very talented. D1 universities looking at me. I mean I was very good. I just happened to settle going to a junior college.</br></br>

And I’ve – I've done a lot. I've had a lot of accomplishments, but when you look at my record, when you look up – you don't see these things. You see negative. But it takes a person to get out there and ask questions and – and ask someone that knows you and ask people that actually know you, that knows about you, and knows who you are, and who you were, and what you're capable of, you know?</br></br>

Like I said, man, these – these places, these jails should offer things. They should offer assistance. They should offer more than just trying to send you to jail and prisons and – and prison is not good for people. We call it rehabilitation, but it's not rehabilitation, you know?</br></br>

I was telling her that, you know, these – these – these COs they don’t – they don't do no walk. Like here at the jail, they do walks every 30 minutes. Every 30 minutes, they do a walk.</br></br> 

They come by and they – they beat the doors and they do a count, you know? Every 30 minutes. At the reception centers in prison or prisons, you don't see them.</br></br> 

They don't do walks. They don’t do – they'll do one walk in the morning and one walk when they get ready to go home; about maybe 20 minutes to 30 minutes before they go home, they'll do a walk. That's it.</br></br>

That’s it. The rest of the time, you know, that’s hours. Think about that; that's eight, nine hours. They're – they’re there for hours. You're just in there.</br></br> 

Either getting beat up by your bunkee or - or – this – also lots of people are dying. And – and like, man, why’s the response, like, that man was dead a whole hour. And people wonder – people wonder why that – hey, that guy – that guy was dead for a whole hour, that guy was dead for 45 minutes without you even knowing?</br></br>

And they try to – they try to – that's where a lot of the illegal, the – the falsified documentation and stuffs like people don't want to get in trouble because they're not doing what they're supposed to be doing.</br></br> 

A man is in there hollering for his life. "Hey! Hey!" “I am–” "Hey, man down!" "Hey, I've got to get out of here!" And they just laugh.</br></br>

Ma'am, I'm not telling you something that I've heard. I’m telling you something that I’ve seen. That I’ve seen. That I’ve experienced myself.</br></br> 

"Hey man, look, I've gotta get out this cell. Me and him are not compatible. Look, I’m – this is my life. This is for my safety. I have these safety concerns." They laugh at you.</br></br>

They laugh at you. "The only way you getting out this cell is if I see somebody bleeding." That's what they'll tell you.</br></br>

That's what happens in your prisons. That’s what happens in our prisons. Taxpayer’s money. People – people in these places and – this is what's going on.</br></br> 

Cameras are not even there. Cameras are only in certain parts of the prison. You go in the dayroom? There's no cameras in those dayrooms. There's no cameras pointing at those cells showing you what's going on.</br></br>

Like, here in this jail, you've got cameras – one, two, you’ve got two different cameras in this - in this pod right now. In this jail. One pointing at me, one pointing at the dayroom, one pointing towards the cells, and for all – they can see everything that's going on.</br></br>
 
They got cameras in this rotunda, cameras in the hallways; why don't you have cameras like that in these prison systems? So people can see what's going on, so you can go back and you can replay videos, so you can see what people are – can see what's going on, what happened to their family member, how their family member died.</br></br> 

What – what type of things is going on? Show them this process and what is – how this everything happens.</br></br>

And that’s – that's the honest to God truth, you know? It's real. And – and because a correction officer may not like a person or may not like a charge a person has, they allow you to get hurt.</br></br> 

They allow you to get punched on and – and hit – striked – you know, while they turn a blind eye. They're the very ones that's showing people your paperwork on their computer screens. And that’s – that's illegal. You can’t – you're not supposed to be able to do that, you know?</br></br>

It's all fun and games, you know? There's things in life you have to laugh at, there’s things that – but stuff like that? That's not funny.</br></br>
 
Ma'am, you know that's somebody's son? Somebody's dad? What if I told you that was just somebody that was just – he was in there for a DUI?</br></br>

What if I told you that was his high school sweetheart he was with? And he was only 18 – 19 years old, she was 17? Two-year difference. They were in high school together, and they just continued dating after he graduated. You believe that he deserved to die?</br></br>

You see what I'm saying? There's things that happen like that. Of course, if you compare that to somebody that's 20, 30 years old messing with a five-year-old, a ten-year-old. We all have our feelings about certain things, you know?</br></br> 

And I – I don't agree with it. I don't think that's right. That's a baby. That’s a baby – that's a child. I don't agree with it.</br></br> 

I don't agree with taking something from a woman that she didn't choose – that she didn’t willingly give you on her own free will. It's not right. It's not right to rape anyone.</br></br>

It's not right to do these things. It's not right to do these things. It's not right. It’s not.</br></br>

But I cannot – I'm not the one - I can't sentence that man. I'm not the one that can – that's gonna go and – and be that man’s – the grim reaper for that man. That's not for us to do that, ma'am. That's not for us to punish him.</br></br> 

That's not for us to go and do things to him and take his life or do something drastic, violent towards to him, or to cause him misery mentally, to where he takes his own life. That's not for us to do.</br></br>

There's some people that can be redeemed. There's people that can be redeemed, that can get help, get assistance. Give them the help and assistance that they need, you know?</br></br>

We don't have to agree with things. We don't have to like things. And God says that in the Bible.</br></br> 

We don’t have to like things. We don't have to agree with things. When wrong is done, we don't have to – we don’t have to necessarily like it, you know?</br></br>

Is it – is it okay to call back or no?</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, absolutely.</br></br>

Caller: Because it says we have one minute left.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, absolutely. You can call back.</br></br>

Caller: I have – we have – I’m still – I still have dayroom time left. We out here an hour and a half. But if it's okay with you, is it okay to call back right now?</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, absolutely. Thank you so much for calling and sharing.</br></br>

Caller: All right. I'll call right back right now, so when we hang up just, it'll be me.</br></br>

UCI: Okay. I'll talk to you soon then.
