This letter was written by a person incarcerated at High Desert.</br></br>

Ever since the COVID crisis came to this prison they mishandled it and it led to many deaths. The very first death I remember is one of my friends that battled with breathing problems. And they denied him medical attention when he was suffering to breathe one day.</br></br> 

So he walk to the medical hall and they denied him. And as he was making his way back to his housing building and collapsed right there. And that was the last time I've seen him before his life was stolen because they didn't want to take a time out to see what was going on with this person.</br></br>

They mishandled helping him, he could have still been here. They only released about under 100 prisoners due to COVID-19 but they didn't stop the spread of COVID-19. Because they were bringing other prisoners from San Quentin where it was a major breakout there and other prisons as well.</br></br> 

And that's when half of the yard I'm in got infected with this disease.</br></br>

I've been impacted by the pandemic because I've haven't been able to get any proper medical attention. To see a doctor about my health, for my eyes, the bullet in my neck, or my back pain, and also my dental health. They hadn't even attempted to make certain thing available to us hurt at HDSP.</br></br>

The only thing they really get going on is mental health and they stay trying to put everyone on psych medication around here. But yeah I'm really affected because I don't get to do anything that can further my release date that is on Christmas day this year.</br></br>

But it's so easy to get into some trouble to further extend your release as trouble just met me. It's not one good thing anybody here at HDSP would tell you they enjoy here at this prison.
