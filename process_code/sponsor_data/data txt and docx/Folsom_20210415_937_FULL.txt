This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Folsom.</br></br>4/7/2021</br></br>Well straight to the point not a minute to lose because the world is ending and my story one day will be told. It was the year 2020, and as we await the relay for life to come up, which is the cancer awareness month mid-May or June you hear the first news of a virus in the other side of the world.</br></br>Then less than a week you hear China spraying to disinfect areas in the streets, then you hear it has spread through out the country, by then you start saying I saw that in a move world war Z, but wait its spreading now to other countries. And you look at the TV and red areas are on the map.</br></br>I’m watching the news and saying shit it happening, and then you hear in the news (fake news) guess from how? Yes, your dear president! But now doctors are saying something about out of control rise of a virus called covid-10 spreading across Asia, and other parts of the world.</br></br>And now you see in the news, authority in China slapping the shit out of people that don’t want to stay indoors or out the way because they’re spraying inside offices and streets all around to control a virus to spread.</br></br>People are saying to go back to your home to your families and to your countries, and now New York got RED dots all over the state and hoping the cruise ship that’s in San Francisco Bay is not carrying any people infected with the virus.</br></br>Now I don’t know if you know but if an invasion is to hit the United States of America, they must gas all inmates (Look that up for facts please). So back to whatever I was saying, word in the yard is don’t let the ship in our ports, what happens if it comes in to prison, the only way in is from staff, that work here.</br></br>And then I hear in the news San Francisco’s got RED dots one bigger than the other and date is March or April, and rumors of lock downs but no cure of virus and a list of symptoms, and you hear anybody cough or sneeze you get a look, or you give him a look. You give him a look like you hungry for brain?</br></br>Now the news is saying COVID-19 in prisons and is it a reception center or a county jail, we did not know if there are any transfers to courts. There are new laws, but no one is going anywhere. Anybody that went for a resentencing and stayed in a county jail, till it was okay to move inmates again.</br></br>And all this was taking months (Remember prisons are too full capacity of inmate and the state is saying lower capacity, everyone’s to go home specially now). You see the news and other channels say different things, one’s saying out break money bit, no no it WWZ and other news tell you don’t see moves that could worry you with what you are hearing or watching on TV.</br></br>So I’m thinking when I call my mom if she brings it up, will talk about it. And so she tells me are you seeing the news, people are going crazy over toilet paper. I told her shit what happen with washing your ass with water or using leaves. She laughs and I try to keep calm so she would not worry.</br></br>So I told her to tell my brother to go and get some stuff to stock up at home, TP, can food and water, and not to tell no one or they won’t have to go to the store to get some they’ll get it from your house. I continue with the don’t worry about me, everything looks normal in here so far.</br></br>But we were going on a lock down just so if someone gets it, it does not spread. If only she knew that the prisons of America were not prepared for this or knew what to do. And you know in prison you got all kind of people like ex-soldiers, prison veteran’s lawyers, all kind of different professions, don’t forget the know it all’s, and also a much of kids (18 and up) with all kinds of ideas of government conspiracies of what they would do to us.</br></br>Word in the news is San Quentin received a transfer from Chino and the spread is on, wait for it wait for it! One dead, two dead, etc., 20 dead. Moving sick, you know bus transfers are money makers so don’t stop transferring people until they tell us, how’s “they” nobody knows its above pay grade.</br></br>And now in Folsom there putting tents and bathrooms on wheels cost $1.5 million per month. Now I’m thinking I’m fuck! Because if my neighbors got sick, the neighbors from his left and right side would also go to quarantine sick or not.</br></br>So not only sick people were being sent, also people that wasn’t sick was being sent to quarantine. So now it’s looking like concentration camp in Germany. It was looking scary for me, so when correction officer’s announce modify program in the building, (but there will be showers), I said I better let everyone else shower first to see if they put anything in the water or if they were to be gas.</br></br>Sounds funny but being so solver in prison for so many years of everything food, drink, drugs, bills, traffic, stuff of what we are not living with, and which come with responsibilities like taking care of family. You just want an Advil pill and go to sleep thinking tomorrow everything is back to normal nothing happen.</br></br>And seeing so much PBS and quest channel it puts things in your mind, I mean don’t get me wrong it’s also very educational. So don’t call the station and get it shut off. All there is in the news is bad news; especially if you see world news then you really want to cry.</br></br>Also, the visiting room was where the sick been kept for quarantine and later they were sent to the woman’s side for quarantine, and every week inmates were been tested. One of the buildings in Folsom prison that never got sick was building 5, but some did get sent to quarantine in the hold with what was called a positive negative test. Whatever that means.</br></br>But one thing did happen, it made me stronger in faith and made me more humble. And yes, I tell my mom the news of what the prison is doing and how “safe” they are keeping us. It is nerve reeking that the answers of officer’s were that they did know what to do and just going on what the warden was telling them or Sacramento.</br></br>No one or nobody wanted to be accountable for anything above their pay grade. (All of a sudden). So with the mask wearing, social distancing and the don’t go out, avoid contact with people and family, I am thinking what my mom is going through and other family’s when business were shut down and no jobs or work, my brother was on and off but manage.</br></br>When I saw that RED dots were all over America it’s when I knew America is not ready for an invade on America, people panic for gloves, face masks and toilet paper. (“I always had & have a question in my head and that what ever happened to the doctor in the beginning of the epidemic and if I’m correct the first to die of COVID, I don’t think in this country but mention some thin of a cure or a breakthrough of some sort.???).</br></br>Know the moment comes with the uncomfortable wearing of the masks, I felt like a Guinea pig were staff tells you do this or try this, no wait only use medical mask or its okay make your own. Wait COVID is in the air or where you touch, wait it’s like the flu.</br></br>And the number one cure for all thins doctors and nurses tell you is “drink water”, I thought religion and medicine don’t go together because it sounds like Ifa to me (Santeria).</br></br>I am not saying it does not work, because I practice tai chi moving meditation and a little chi gong praying to my saints and drink lots of water with some spiritual cleansing (flowers, water, smoke and rituals ache) and lots of faith, it just wasn’t my time. Namaste.</br></br>P.S. If you make a book look me up.
