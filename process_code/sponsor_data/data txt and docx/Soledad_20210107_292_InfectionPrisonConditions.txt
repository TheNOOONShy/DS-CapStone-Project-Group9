Well they finally got me out of that infected dorm. I was there for 18 days and I didn’t test positive. Never tested positive and I've been tested on three different occasions and never once positive! I even saw a man die right in front of me with a CO giving him CPR and the dude was already dead. That’s crazy huh!</br></br>

I saw what that COVID-19 does to people. It just takes the wind out of you and you have trouble breathing because it is attacking the lungs. That’s a cold way to go, but that is just the way it is. I cannot describe it any other way except that the way I’ve seen it!</br></br>

I wouldn’t wish this on anybody, not even my worst enemy. Well maybe a couple, just kidding, but yeah it’s a cold way to go! These people fucked up. They didn’t have a plan on how you are going to put uninfected people with infected people. Go figure that one out and that’s what they’re doing, the beat goes on estan pendejos sabes, no pun intended!</br></br>

What these guys, what they should have done was lock up this whole prison for 30 days and I mean the whole prison. Instead, they dropped the ball, oh send these guys over here and these guys over there and let’s see what happens and boom they drop the bomb on themselves. That’s exactly what happened just like how America wasn’t ready.
