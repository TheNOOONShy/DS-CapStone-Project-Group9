This story was told by a person incarcerated at Avenal.</br></br>

UCI: What is the current COVID-19 situation at your facility? What’s the most concerning or troubling to you?</br></br> 

Caller: Okay well, most of us have already had, have been of COVID, already done with the COVID, we’ve already caught it, already been to the process of the two-week quarantine. Right now, they barely opened, they started opening up the yards for us to program with other buildings. So the distancing, I don’t know what’s being told by people out there in the streets, but these people are trying to provide social distancing on paperwork.</br></br>

They are providing us masks. They start out with cloth masks, and then they went to the N95s, and then most recently, apparently the money right now for masks, the N95 masks, and now we went back to the regular masks. The social distancing is not really available to us, I mean they empty some of our bunks are emptied, but I still have a bunkie that’s two feet away from me.</br></br> 

So, you know I might go to, want to use the restroom, I’m less than a foot away from the person next to me. When I take a shower, same story.</br></br>

When I go to eat dinner, I gotta eat with four people at a the table so, they’re only social distancing us when it’s to their convenience. I do find, we do find a lot of the staff are not wearing masks, and they're very- [unintelligible] masks. But they are not setting an example for us.</br></br> 

We’re not being provided chemicals on a regular basis. We have to steal what we can get to keep our person clean, our area clean, our racks clean, stuff that we touch clean.</br></br>

I mean, I understand they are doing some stuff for us, but again that’s so our loved ones can think they are doing whatever they can, but I mean the social distancing is not really, really applicable to us in this situation because prisons were not designed for this type of programing. It’s just a meat warehouse and so now they’re trying to, you know, rush I would say, trying do some kind of social distancing to separate us.</br></br> 

But I can’t you know, I have a bunkie, he’s less than two feet away, he sleeps underneath me so, I don’t have anybody to the right of me or to the left of me. But that doesn’t matter because I can go to the day room and sit at a table with three other guys, or go into the TV room and sit next to four, five, other guys.</br></br>  

So, you know the social distancing is not really, is not really being met in here. So, they are providing some people with the vaccines, but there is a big old controversy about that. I mean, I don’t really, don’t know what much else to say, you know, except that quite a few people have died in here because of catching the COVID.</br></br>

Those of us who are force enough to catch it and make it through, I won’t take the vaccine personally. I’ve been hearing stories from officers about the vaccine is a governmental conspiracy to control the population. You know so, when you have, when you have people from the free world talking about, they don’t want to use the vaccine, you know how they expect us to get the vaccines you know? </br></br>

I’m good, I’m not gonna get the vaccine. It takes years and years and years to perfect the vaccine. They did it within months, you know, and they all got emergency releases of the vaccine, so they don’t have enough background studies on it, so, but those who are taking it, my bunkie took it, he was a never never, which means he never, he never had the COVID so, that’s kind of a good thing.</br></br> 

I know that some people take the vaccine and gotten sick after the second shot, a couple, even a couple of officers have died from taking the vaccine. So, I mean I don’t know what more they can do for us as far as the COVID but they’re trying to open up the program again and I think it’s kind of a stupid idea because I watch the news every day and you know there’s like two more variants of the COVID coming, and it's supposed to be worse than the first one.</br></br>

But for some stupid reason they want to go back to normal programing and intermingle all of us, you know. I don’t know what else you’d like to know but -</br></br>

UCI: Yeah this is -</br></br>

Caller: I can tell you this, when the COVID first started, I caught the COVID of late July, of last year and the captain came into our building and he said that if you know, at least 30 of us get sick, they’re gonna quarantine the whole building. But they informed us that if at least 30 of us came out sick that you know, they would quarantine the whole building and it’ll be what it's gonna be. And so, and then this happened because a couple guys started getting sick in here.</br></br>

And we were like the last building in the whole prison, we were like literally the last building on the whole prison that were getting COVID because we were, we were pretty much locked all willing down. And the mistake that they made is they kept moving people around. Shifting people from yard to yard. I mean you’re talking about six yards, five yards, four yards coming here.</br></br> 

And for some reason they designated our building, one of our buildings, is cell living, they designated that building as a COVID building. So those who got sick would go there for two-week quarantine and they would come back out to one of the other big buildings for 90 days, 90-day cleanup or whatever after, after a couple months and they would kick us back out to this building here that we’re in.</br></br>

And so, the biggest mistake they made was shuffling people around, and then after a while they end up moving, they end up moving them into three yards and in these three yards, the quarantine yards. And it all stand down because PIA was locked down, they were losing millions of dollars for PIA industry.</br></br>

And a lot of us were trying to tell the captain, “Look if you guys had any fucking sense, you guys would just shut the whole prison down, shut every yard, shut every building down, and let everyone do the two-week quarantine and you’d get your workers back in two weeks, instead of six months.” But their idea of handling the situation was to shuffle people around and get everybody sick at one time, and it happened okay.</br></br>

So, after the captain’s team invaded us in our building, and he made that comment about a week later, 50 of us got sick, we all tested and 50 got sick.</br></br>

And he moved the whole building out to the 20. They moved us all out and I’ve been in this building for four years, and so we went we, they moved us out to the 20, and we all did our two-week quarantine and only half of us came back. And the other half went to the 40, the quarantine building. And, so I mean they just, they mishandled this whole COVID thing terribly. They were not, they were so little prepared.</br></br>

They were trying to play catch up on something that was way ahead of them, you know. And they started putting up these partitions, these plexiglass partitions. I mean they’re trying to do all those little, little things, these little subtle things to us, to make it seem like they’re doing something, but in reality, whatever the public has been told, whatever public sign, these people have failed miserably, containing the COVID.</br></br> 

There’s not too many cases now, again, again they’re starting to reopen the program for us again, we’re still limited on the amount of things we can do like an exercise equipment, no softball equipment, but they’re letting these guys play handball, which is, you know, four guys to a court and there are 16 guys out there.</br></br> 

So you gotta whole group of guys again, just breathing all over each other without masks on. So, I don’t hardly ever go outside anymore anyways, so it doesn’t matter to me but, I mean the biggest, the biggest problem to me is this administration has done was to move people.</br></br> 

And, you know, even though only staff members, they know what the hell was going on when that was happening, because of course you know, we can only ask the officers that are working in the building, “What’s going on?” And when they don’t know, then, then nobody knows and we don’t know what happens so, but here we are.</br></br>

2021, I don’t know how many new cases are still here in the prison, but I know that those of us that are able, we have a good mask, a good supply of masks, the N95s, the pop masks, we’re making our homemade masks now. They would frown on that back in the past, but now they don’t care that we make our own masks.</br></br> 

You know, we have to do what we have to do for ourselves because, you know, in all, in all seriousness, we’re kind of butt hurt you know, these guys don’t really give a shit about us. You know, so, it’s hard to explain to our families, the way that we live in here, because you know, they can’t experience it, but I can understand that the world is like a big prison right now because of COVID.</br></br> 

So, if I had to, if I had to have anyone get an idea of what it is like in here, well now that you guys have the COVID out there, that’s pretty much what it’s like in here, except you guys have just a bit more freedom than we do to come and go as you please. But, you know, they got us locked up in a big cage, you know, that we can’t go nowhere and do anything. So we have to take it upon ourselves to take the measures we can take to keep ourselves safe, hand-washing, you know when we get the chemicals we make sure we spray all the surfaces down.</br></br> 

But you know, it doesn’t help either that we have a bunch of dirtbags that just don’t care about anybody else, and don’t wanna wear the mask, they cough all over the place, they touch stuff, they don’t use, they don’t clean their hands when they use the bathroom, you know just little stuff like that.</br></br>

There is people like that in here too, just because they are out there, they're dirtbags and they don’t care. So upon everything else you gotta deal with, you gotta deal with those type of people. So it’s just an accumulation of a lot of stuff happening, but you know we’re making do, we’re surviving, and we’re doing the best we can so, for me now personally, when I caught the COVID, I didn’t get it as bad as I thought it was gonna be. I had a lot of a throat issues, mucus, I had a hard time breathing for a little bit.</br></br>

I did have a slight fever. I was very lethargic. I was very tired all the time for like the first two weeks. And like the third week, so the time’s up, I don’t know if you want me to call back again, if you have enough information or whatever else you need to know. But the calls are now two and a half cents a minute, so it’s like 40 cents for the whole 15 minutes, so I can call you back if you need me to call back.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, if you would like to call back and share anything else, definitely feel free to, and if you know anyone that would like to share their story as well.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, you know I actually have a couple of buddies that would be willing to call you, I'ma let them know what my experience from calling you, what it was about and hopefully they’ll call you. I can call you back, if that’s not a big deal, I don’t know what else you wanna know but pretty much a nutshell these people have failed so.</br></br>

UCI: Well thank you so much for calling, and feel free to call back anytime.</br></br>

Caller: All right, you got it, you got it. Thank you so much for your time.</br></br>

UCI: Of course. Bye-bye.</br></br>

Caller: And remember. But keep in mind if we get paid, you know my number.</br></br>

UCI: Okay, bye-bye.
