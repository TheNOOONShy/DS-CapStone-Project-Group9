I thought that catching the coronavirus would be a way that I could make it out of prison, sounds crazy right? But after spending three decades in the prison system for two misdemeanor wobblers would have anyone go to the extreme to get out of prison. Even if it means catching a deadly virus, putting your own life at risk in order to return to one’s own family.</br></br>

My appeal has been denied many times in the feds. Which I also have another one pending. But still nothing is promised.</br></br> 

My story is very simple. Man spends three decades in the prison system for two misdemeanor wobblers which are petty theft and a traffic violation. Gets denied multiple times even the judge said himself that he would case jurisdiction if he were to set me free.</br></br> 

In addition to my declining health problems, which I am ADA. I am under the American Disability Act. I suffer from failure of liver psoriasis, I end up catching the coronavirus which it made me very sick.</br></br>

Because I am high-risk medical, as well as under chronic care. While I fought the coronavirus, I did keep some sense of hope that this could be my only opportunity to regain my freedom.</br></br> 

But to no avail. Nothing happened. The reason why I’m telling you this is because I’m trying to get my story out on how I was wronged by the prison system!</br></br> 

And it’s not just me there are many people just like me who have caught the coronavirus not purposely but, tried to desperately use COVID as a way to get back to their families. I believe anyone would do the same thing if they were in my situation.</br></br>

What I am saying is I really need your help getting my story out to society for the sake of others who may be suffering or in trouble.</br></br>

Please and thank you.</br></br>

And God bless. Don’t forget to wear your mask!</br></br>

PS: I was sentenced to 25 to life on both terms. I’ve never been convicted of a violent and I still don’t have one right now. My history consists of property crimes. Please help.
