When the state looked for early release inmates, they found that the ones they selected had a large percentage of being homeless if released. I am not one of them. I was visited twice a month.</br></br> My loved ones drove at least a bit more than two hours just to visit me. These are not young people. They are in their late 50’s as am I. However, they believe in me as a person.</br></br> They support my conduct and have made provisions for me to succeed in prison and one day soon when I’m released. Being unable to “see” how I’m doing is taking a toll on them. I write them often, as they also write me.</br></br> But the pain of things going from bad, one being in prison, to worse, me having a death sentence is crushing their hopes of me ever being released. This constant stress affects my health and theirs. I ask again, at what point does the punishment match the crime?</br></br>
