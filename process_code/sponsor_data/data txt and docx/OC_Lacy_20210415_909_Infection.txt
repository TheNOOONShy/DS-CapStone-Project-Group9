Though scared is an emotion one rarely shows in an environment where being scared can be seen as a sign of weakness others can abuse, and sadistic mind games for others to entertain. Still, it’s kind of impossible not to feel this fear within for a disease not seen yet, its deadly havoc is clear for anyone to see.</br></br>

I don’t care how many tattoos you got, or whether you’re a badass tough guy, a gangster, this invisible viral infection fears no one and scares us all. No one wants to die. We all have someone or something to live for, and even if you didn’t think so, believe me we all do. Something about death seems to put things into perspective.</br></br>

The sudden thought of urgent death brings out my appreciation for life and for all its beauty. I never had kids, having spent most of my life behind bars. But I’d think the love I have for my parents is how I’d feel. Love is beautiful and something I want more of.</br></br>

I love life and I sure don’t want it to end, nor end the life of those. I love all of a sudden, I appreciate life so much more, and have a newly found urgency to live life for. Which makes the situation that much scary. Back in here, things aren’t all too well.</br></br>

Visits still are not permitted, outbreaks through the Orange County continue to occur. One such occurrence took place in early December. When a cellmate of mine went to court and was placed in a holding cell with others; inmates housed throughout different locations at the jail.</br></br>

Unfortunately, some of these guys were infected by deputy’s working their housing location. I am sure I don’t need to explain just how infectious COVID-19 is, and was on this particular occasion. My cellmate became ill soon after. We all knew he was infected and we were all so damn pissed!</br></br>

For we knew despite everything we try, and we did, we knew it was only a matter of when. Imagine living inside a cell with someone who is infected? Yes we notified medical staff but let me tell you how medical staff as well as the entire Orange County sheriff department cared more about hiding the true facts from the general public then it was to contain and defeat it.</br></br>

Having had numerous legal lawsuits, they were fighting their number one priority was to try and deceive everyone as if their jail system was safe and had protections in place. So when someone complains about COVID-19 related symptoms, they’d try to test anyone as a last resort, if that person showed severe signs of illness.</br></br>

Then if that person was found to have COVID-19, he’d be put in a pod with infected inmates quarantined. They wouldn’t go back to where he or she was housed to test everyone to try and contain a potential outbreak. So that on paper, these numbers looked low.</br></br>

This was their way of doing things at first, before even this was exposed and they were forced to change. As my cellmate got sicker, I began to get sick too, because my cellmate’s symptoms were bad and we both were tested and sent to quarantine.</br></br>

No medicine, no doctors checking on us, just a whole cell block also called “pods”, full of COVID-19 positive infected inmates separated from the rest. No medical staff, nor medical housing, nothing! So much for finding comfort in knowing we’d be okay!</br></br>

Although my symptoms was only a few days of flu like symptoms, my celly and others however were much worse! Even then they were told they couldn’t do nothing else since they weren't to the point of no return, pretty much.</br></br>

I felt helpless and alone. I’ve felt things I ain’t ever felt in all these years incarcerated. This pandemic really brought/caused so much mental distress and fear. I sympathize for those whose fears got the best of them. The fear only to be made even more real, when someone you know has succumbed to this deadly virus.</br></br>

Tragedy struck on two different occasions for me. On October of 2020, and January 2021, two people whose lives personally meant something special to me died from complications from this novel coronavirus. It’s not easy. This whole year past hasn’t been easy, not at the slightest bit.
