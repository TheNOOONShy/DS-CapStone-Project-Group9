Hello PrisonPandemic,</br></br>

In return I hope that this letter finds you in the best of spirits mentally and physically.</br></br>

In these trying times situations become difficult and sometimes hard to handle. But we must put our best foot forward and overcome whatever roadblocks we face. During this pandemic I've been maintaining a positive mind-frame and doing charitable work to give back.</br></br>
 
I took this moment to enroll in college and catch up on things that I barely had enough time to do.</br></br>

In this situation, I either witnessed or heard about someone succumbing to the virus. As bad as it was in here, I thought for sure I would catch this virus. It's really not much you can do in means of dodging it because we are sardines packaged in a can (limited space).</br></br>

I've just adhered to the rules they set for us (mask-up, social distancing, washing of hands) and that's what's kept me from contracting the virus.</br></br>

Even though they took away our contact visits, they got assistance from Global Tel-Link and we were afforded two free phone calls a month. So it helped in that aspect to allow many who had great concerns for their family and friends get and stay in contact with them. It is extremely gracious for those whose family and friends don't have money on their phones.</br></br>

I thank you for reaching in and giving me this opportunity to share my story with those I don't know. May you all be safe and know that this too shall pass.</br></br>

Sincerely.
