Theme: Stress: Making a call to family


And allow me to detail what an actual call sounds like with elderly parent; you dial the number using GlobalTel phone monopoly, the phone tells the person on the other end, they are receiving a call from an inmate in the CDCR even though they already know that because they had to create an account to get the collect call in the first place, it's just interrupting your call.</br></br>
Hello....hello....delay.....yes what....hello....are you there.....what......e you there.....yes hello, how are you doing.....good.....that's good......how is mom doing and how is her health.......well I got some bad[RECORDER MESSAGE; YOU ARE TALKING TO AN INMATE FORM THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS SOLEDAD CA YOU AND YOUR CALLER ARE BEING RECORDED]</br></br>
all of that was stated at the beginning of the call, but now interrupting and eating up more of your phone call</br></br>

It maybe days or weeks before you get the chance to go though that gain. Now imagine standing in the rain for 2 hours only to have no one answer right then because the only time of day that you can call, the person you are calling is at work. I can see, at a glance, this can sound like whining.</br></br>
And very frequently you hear, well you should of thought of that before you went to prison. Undoubtedly some of you are obnoxiously nodding your head yes because you agree. The problem with this thinking is this; the law is the law whether you are incarcerated or not. It is against the law to rob someone on the street and it is against the law to rob someone in prison.</br></br>
If the objective of CDCR is to correct one's behavior, and you agree with that idea, then you can't say, "I as a tax paying citizen want these criminals locked up for breaking the law, because I am a God-fearing law-abiding citizen". And then say, "now that you are in jail, [criminal], I support the idea of having correctional staff break the law whenever they feel like it and show no example of human decency, because you're in jail and that's what you get". Kind of smells like hypocrisy.</br></br>
