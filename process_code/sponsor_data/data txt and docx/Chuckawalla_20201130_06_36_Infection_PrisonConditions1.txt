This story was told by a person incarcerated at Chuckawalla.</br></br>

Caller: Well, we have a building that’s in our yard that’s COVID. And everybody else, we have three yards, three buildings in our yard.</br></br> 

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br> 

Caller: One’s for COVID and the two upfront are just regular, I guess, people that already went through it.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah.</br></br> 

Caller: Are back at their buildings.</br></br>
UCI: And what is troubling or concerning to you?</br></br>
Caller: Well, what’s concerning to me is that I was okay, and then they said they detected COVID, so they separated us.</br></br> 

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>

Caller: But then they, they put me in the education building but then later they said, "No we’re gonna put you in the COVID building," where it's mixed with other people and other yards, like people that were sick.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>
Caller: As soon as I got there that’s when I felt something. Like I felt something hit me. And the next day I couldn’t, for four days I couldn’t eat, I couldn’t, you know, I couldn’t breathe, just getting much worse.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>
Caller: And then I had to go man down. I told them 'cause it was just hard for me to breathe, I couldn’t eat, I had nothing.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br> 

Caller: I just I felt terrible. So, they sent me to central health, and they gave me oxygen. But it was - I told them, "It was just, this is not - I don’t feel the same. Something is really wrong."</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>
Caller: So, they prescribed me pills. Pills that I guess, one was for seizures. Well, I never took seizures but the nurse told me it was for, to calm me down and some other pills. But I go, "I don’t wanna take pills, something’s wrong. I need to be check on."</br></br>

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>
Caller: So, they sent me to the hos- I go, "I need to go to the hospital." And they detected pneumonia. They detected, I guess, I don’t know what else.</br></br>
But they said, you know, "Yeah, we’ve got to rush you to the hospital." So, they flew me from a helicopter from [redacted] all the way to [redacted].</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>
Caller: And there they told me that, you know, "You're really, your lungs are really bad. We detected that you couldn’t breathe, we detected pneumonia". So, they said that, "There’s a chance you might not make it." Which pretty much scared me.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>
Caller: And then from there they said you know, they checked my blood, they checked everything and said, "You qualify for - what they gave the president, the Remdesivir." So, I was on five days, four, five days on Remdesivir. And after the third day I felt more, I guess more stronger. I guess I could breathe more and everything but still.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>
And then from there they sent me back to - back to the prison and central health. They held me there for five days to see a doctor saying, to be cleared. And ever since then yeah, just now I'm back so.</br></br>
UCI: Yeah. I'm sorry you had to go through that.</br></br>
Caller: Yeah. It was really, I mean I was fine but then as soon as they started mixing us that’s when it just, that’s when it hit me.
