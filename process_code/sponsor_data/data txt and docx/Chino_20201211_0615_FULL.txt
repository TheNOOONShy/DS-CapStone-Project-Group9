This story was told by a person incarcerated at Chino.</br></br>

UCI: And what's the current COVID-19 situation at your facility?</br></br>

Caller: It's the worst in the whole state.</br></br>

UCI: What is troubling or concerning you about it?</br></br>

Caller: Uh everything, the whole medical system and the way they went about it, the massive movement they made. They did it twice, and after every uh massive movement within the facility, everybody got sick right after it.</br></br>

UCI: Can you tell me about those movements? What's been happening?</br></br>

Caller: Well, what happened was that when this whole pandemic started, the camp guards, they didn't know how to react to it. They didn't have a plan. They had never faced anything like this. So, they didn't know what to do.</br></br>

So, what they did was uh, they kind of shut down the whole program, and what I mean by that is they like cut down on the yard time and the dayroom time. So, instead of letting everybody out at once, they were letting 10 people at a time for an hour or less than that. So instead of actually leaving people in their cell, that way, you know what I mean, it wouldn't spread.</br></br>

So, when they did that thing, everybody started getting sick. What they did was they designated one building for our isolation, basically, which was to be the quarantine. But unfortunately that's not enough for everybody.</br></br>

So, what happened was when they started – when they needed more beds, they started moving people around within the facility. And when that happened everybody started getting sick because there were people coming from other yards that were sick, and they kept spreading it.</br></br>

UCI: Do you remember when the first people started to get sick there? Do you know what month?</br></br>

Caller: The first one was – I don't remember the first one exactly, but I know the second one was around September, the beginning of September.</br></br>

UCI: And when did they start moving people?</br></br>

Caller: They, I don't know exactly.</br></br>

UCI: That's okay.</br></br>

Caller: The first time was in September. We got tested on the 25th, and that's when like everybody was sick, nearly. I even got my test results. Everybody was sick at that time.</br></br>

UCI: What do you think would make the situation at your facility better right now?</br></br>

Caller: Give them the proper training, proper training, and if people would actually like be like – I don't know. They don't know how to, they don’t know how react to this. They're not trained properly. They don't even follow the guidelines when it comes to safety, you know, wear a mask and all that.</br></br>

UCI: What else would you like people to know about your experience?</br></br> 

Caller: Okay um, on the letter that I got, they were talking about like to explain how it has affected us with getting visits and all that? Okay, well, I think that's a big part when it comes to staying healthy you know like in your mind and everything when you have contact with your family, when you see them, and when you talk to them. And when they stopped that out of nowhere, they haven't even been trying to find new ways to give us visits.</br></br>

And what they do is they're letting you have video visits with your family. But it's only – they're only letting 10 people or 15 people, and unfortunately that's not enough.</br></br>

But it just takes a toll on your mind. And I mean everybody is like– you can feel the hostility because of people being – if they take everything you care for and we can't basically have that contact, people just don't care anymore. They're like, "Well, whatever" you know?</br></br>

UCI: How have you been coping?</br></br>

Caller: I've been coping all right. I mean, actually I'm fortunate that I can actually talk to my family. A lot of people are not fortunate like that. So, I'm doing great. I have a great family. They help me. They understand everything. I'm blessed.</br></br>

UCI: How has it affected your family?</br></br>

Caller: How long I'm talking?</br></br>

UCI: How has the COVID situation at your facility affected your family at home?</br></br>

Caller: Well, my family is actually doing pretty good. None of them have gotten sick. So, they're okay.</br></br>

UCI: Okay. Is there anything else that you would want people to know about what it's like inside right now?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah. I think your health, if people really know what goes down inside the prison as far as – people think that we're being cared for and everything in the right way. Unfortunately, we're not. And it's not because they don't want to do it, but it's because they don't know how. They have to be trained properly in order for them to know how to react to these things.</br></br>

And unfortunately because they don't, we're paying the price. We're the institution that has the highest deaths because of this COVID-19. We are actually the first institution that started with this. We had it bad the second time. The second wave, when it hit in September, maybe the whole prison tested positive for it. It's unfortunate that these people don't – they still haven't trained them properly.</br></br>

I think uh, I don't know, I think they should be – they should focus more on that, on the medical.</br></br>

UCI: Can you repeat that, sorry, just one more time?</br></br>

Caller: I think they should focus more on overlooking the medical system and proper training of the staff.
