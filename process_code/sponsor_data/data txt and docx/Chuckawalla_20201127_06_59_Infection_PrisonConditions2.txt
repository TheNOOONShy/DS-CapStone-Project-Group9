This story was told by a person incarcerated at Chuckawalla.</br></br>Caller: So, for the most part, they only address it after the fact or after people die or after people really get sick or anything like that. Instead of taking the time to think it through and maybe consider, “hey”, or they don’t ev- they didn’t even take the time to ask us, what could have been issues. They just do it after the fact and hopefully they don’t get sued basically, is what they’re trying to do.</br></br>  UCI: Just trying to cover up. Yeah. You mentioned, has someone died at your facility from COVID?</br></br>  Caller: This partic- right now we’re on our third wave of outbreak, which is Delta yard. You have Charlie yard has one building and all three buildings on Bravo yard are shut down. And in this particular epidemic, we have three deaths in the last couple weeks. Yes.</br></br>  UCI: Wow. What’s, is there. What's the vibe inside right now? Are, how are people reacting to all this?</br></br> Caller: I mean, you know, a lot of us are upset. Obviously our families are upset.</br></br> 

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: Especially about the way they handled it because once the buildings got infected, they basically kept moving people from location, location. They tried to put some people like in education. They put some people in- they put some people in family visiting. They put some people in ad seg.</br></br>  So it, and then basically they blamed medical, saying that medical was in charge. And irony is that medical should’ve known better than to have shuffled and moved people. Especially, some people were moved around when they were in the worst part of their COVID sickness, making them worse.</br></br>

One guy next to me, he ended up getting pneumonia. They had him in central health. They didn’t even- they knew he had pneumonia, didn’t tell him.</br></br> 

UCI: Wow.</br></br>

Caller: And then finally when they forced him to move from cell to cell, that’s when he basically got worse and got to the point where oxygen level, he couldn’t breathe. And then they finally took him to the hospital, after the fact. Instead of saying something ahead of time.
