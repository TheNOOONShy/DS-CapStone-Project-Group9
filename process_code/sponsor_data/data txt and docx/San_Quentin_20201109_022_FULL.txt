This letter was written by a person incarcerated at San Quentin.</br></br>

Greetings. How are you? As time plus pleasure allows me the opportunity to sit down and write to you, first and foremost, how are things out there with you all? As for myself, I'm so glad to hear from you, and you're giving me this opportunity to share my experience.</br></br>

As far as being in San Quentin with COVID, you know, I've never been scared of anything in my life, and I was sentenced to 36 years to life for second degree robbery under the three strikes law. I wasn't scared, but I am scared of this COVID virus. Ever since I contracted the virus, things haven't been the same.</br></br> 

I lost my smell, taste, and I have been having irregular bowel movements, shortness of breath, and that's just some of the side effects. I feel like I'm on death row waiting to be executed.</br></br>

You would think San Quentin would have some sympathy or empathy but no such luck. The food here is horrible. They keep us locked down for 46 and a half hours. Then for one and a half hours, we're allowed a shower, a phone call, and some yard.</br></br> 

I understand I'm in prison for committing a crime, but this coronavirus is a dealbreaker. When I was in court, they didn't mention this in the agreement, and San Quentin broke the agreement by bringing those infected prisoners here from CIM. So, for that, I quit the game. It's over.</br></br>

I wanna go home. This is really stressful. We were doing just fine before COVID. What San Quentin doesn't understand, there is no vaccine for this virus.</br></br> 

No one knows about the side effects. Anything can happen. How many more will have to die before they stop wasting the taxpayers' dollars and let us go? Anything can happen to me.</br></br> 

I'm 60 years old. So, yes, I'm very scared, and you have my life in the hands of an institution that doesn't have any consideration for my well-being.</br></br>

I guess the only thing that's important is the money they receive for my stay here. Now, I have to worry about the flu season, and we don't know how the virus or flu will react together. Well, I think I'm worrying too much, but do you blame me in my situation? Let's look at it this way.</br></br> 

I am hanging in there, and I'm not giving up. So, with that, I would like to thank you for your writing to me and letting me vent.</br></br> 

Sincerely,</br></br> 

Your friend.
