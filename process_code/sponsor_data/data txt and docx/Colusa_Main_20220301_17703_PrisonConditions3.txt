UCI: How do court visits work at the moment?</br></br>

Caller: Court visits?</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>

Caller: Well, when they call us out to go to court, they give us a mask, and then they shackle us up and take us in a van. Like whoever, however, many people are going to court that day from two to six to four, it doesn’t matter. They just load us up in a van and take us there. And then when we get to the courtroom, we have to have our masks on at all times but that's the only thing.</br></br>

We ride in a dirty van, and we go back to the back of the courthouse into the little rooms, and they're dirty as can be. I don't even think they even get cleaned but they're — yeah, it's kind of dirty. Well, a lot dirty.</br></br>

UCI: Have they refused to take you for COVID related reasons?</br></br>

Caller: No. They’ll just take you and take you and take you until — yeah they don't even, I don’t even think it crosses their mind.</br></br>

UCI: Okay. And how would you say the staff has been handling the situation?</br></br>

Caller: On a scale of one to 10?</br></br>

UCI: Sure.</br></br>

Caller: About a two.</br></br>

UCI: Okay. And what would be your biggest complaints about how they handle it?</br></br>

Caller: Dish out some more sanitizer.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>

Caller: They could take it a little bit serious. People do get it and they do die from it. I hope they know that.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>

Caller: So if they took care of it, maybe it would be a little bit less easier not to catch.
