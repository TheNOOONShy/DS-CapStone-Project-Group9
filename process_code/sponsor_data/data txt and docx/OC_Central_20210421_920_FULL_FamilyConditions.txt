Thank you for writing to me and opportunity to be invited in your time. During the time I’ve been here, it’s not the same with the Orange County Sherriff’s department. With our visitations, our mail, our phone calls and even medical patients like me. I just got out from the hospital bed and the new staff don’t understand how much pain I am in every morning. I ask for my butt medication and they don’t take me serious. I’ve been fighting with medical staff for my butt medication, and I’ve been waiting for it by this day. I just got off the hospital from surgery and some days I have to hold my pain. I think is not right for me to go through this.</br></br>

I wish everything can be back to normal times. Even my family is very worried about me, they can even come and see me and is very hard for my family to put money on the phone because they are having hard time with money at home. I wish I could be home working and helping my mom. How I was this time I was working doing family stuff I changed so much. When I had that injury at work the medication came and then I was taking them like candy. And the problems came of drinking using drugs. I was losing it at that time. I can’t give my life away in this jailhouse with everything that is going on with COVID.</br></br>

When I came back to jail everything has been hard to see our families and I remember they were giving us free phone calls. Two’s a week now they are not doing it as much. We are now wearing mask every time we come out of our cells and try not to get close to other inmates. Like last month one inmate passed away of COVID. He was 64 years old by that time we been more careful for myself. I think we are not safe? Most of us ask the staff if we could have more time to be cleaning our facilities.</br></br>

Most inmates don’t even care and others do try to do their best to keep our house clean and safe. Do I think I am safe here? No I am not, there are many reasons why. Most of us have homes and family, others are homeless, and some homeless are sick when they come to jail. We all get tested every time we come to jail and we do 14 days quarantine just to keep us not getting sick, or if we are. But what gets me worried is when they put you with someone that could be sick and the other prisoner is not. That is one of the things that we get worried about. I have a family to go home to, and I am not trying to get them sick but they put you with a homeless no matter what.</br></br>

I just wish one day this COVID would end for good. I am worried everyday. I ask for medical action, the most I can get in here for a check-up and for know my health is good, but in how long this what my family gets worry about?</br></br>

Thank you for your time and I really do hope to hear from you. It is good to have someone to talk to in this times that we are in.
