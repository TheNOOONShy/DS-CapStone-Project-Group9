This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Norco.</br></br>

So here at CRC there are four facilities here, A, B, C, D. Each facility has about 1,000 people in numerous dorms. As people caught COVID, they moved to dorm 410 on D facility. There the idea was move them to a designated dorm for 14 days, “quarantine.”</br></br> 
 
But once it filled up, they were moving people out after seven, eight days. That’s how our dorm caught it, they moved five people out of quarantine way before the 14 days, and one was contagious and our whole dorm got it. This prison continued moving people at random for several months. It really seemed like they were almost purposely spreading COVID all over the prison because there were numerous dorms that were COVID-free for months until they randomly moved inmates in and infected everyone.</br></br>  

So “if” it was not intentional, then it was extremely reckless and irresponsible at best. But then I find out they get $1,600 per inmate who catches COVID for what is suppose to be extra care. But that is the biggest out right bunch of B.S. EVER! They should be financially charged for theft!</br></br> 

For one, they do nothing for us (at all) different because we are sick. In fact I was sick in June, I have asthma and COPD. It took me going by ambulance unable to breath before I saw a doctor! And even then I was prescribed a different inhaler. I have have problems breathing since then and went back three more times because inhalers not working.</br></br> 

It’s now February, I have only seen a doctor that one time! The point is, $1,600 per inmate, 3,000 plus inmates. They made a lot of money from us suffering COVID.</br></br> 
 
Some people in here have caught COVID two and three times. But they put 32 tents on the yard to help relieve some of the overcrowding. Not only did COVID hit there, they also blew all over in the wind, flooded in the rain! It was deemed a failure, all removed.</br></br> 

The prison was given crazy amount of money for that, CDCR has made a ton of money from state funds, yet NOTHING has changed for us, except we have been locked down for a year. We have not seen any family in a year, no visits, and a lot of us, including myself, have lost relationships due to no visits. It is hard enough to have a relationship in here but take the only thing we really have to look forward to away (visiting) and it’s another strain, stress. It does create depression, anxiety, etc., etc.
