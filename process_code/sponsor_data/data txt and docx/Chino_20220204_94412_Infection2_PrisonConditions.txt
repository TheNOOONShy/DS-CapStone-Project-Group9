UCI: To move on to another question, what about, like, the vaccination situation, how has that been at your facility?</br></br>

Caller: To me it’s bad. I was vaccinated in reception before I came to CIU. I got vaccinated in August, and before the corona even hit my building, we talked to the sergeants, lieutenants and everybody, and asked them could they not move people in here that have COVID. And they basically didn't listen to us and we all got COVID, including myself.</br></br> 

Even though we were vaccinated, probably didn’t show any symptoms, they said we all caught COVID. And because of that we been on a standstill, we don’t get programs or nothing no more, we’re just in the building stuck in here until we come off of this lock down.</br></br> 

I guess, apparently there is three phases of isolation which we weren't on for a month. Now we're on regular quarantine, which is two weeks, then they have another quarantine called the COVID recovery and that - we're still not getting program. Like, I was supposed to be going home sometime this year, but it's on pause because the staffing’s down with corona, our counselors are down with corona, the medical staff is down with corona.</br></br> 

We can’t even go to the dentist 'cause the dentist people are down with corona. It’s like we’re not getting nothing done here.</br></br>UCI: Gotcha man, yeah, and yeah, I mean I can only imagine what you guys are going through, you know, I’m guessing it’s definitely a whole lot, you know, it’s already hard out here, but I can only imagine what it’s like in there. And like to move on to a different question, you know, how have you been coping with everything that’s going on, like, with the crisis?</br></br>Caller: As far as everything going on right now, there’s a lot of positive role models in here, like I’m part of a religious group, Muslims, I pray five times a day, and try to help conditions get better for us. Because right now it seems like nobody is taking it serious to what is going on in here. It’s very bad there is no social distancing or anything, so all I can do is pray five times a day and hope for the best and seek better and positive energy from people.
