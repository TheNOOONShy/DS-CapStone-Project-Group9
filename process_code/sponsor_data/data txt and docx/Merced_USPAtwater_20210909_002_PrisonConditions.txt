This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Merced USP Atwater Federal Center.</br></br>

I was allowed two 15 minute phone calls once a month and half the time I was never able to use both calls ‘cause the facility would be locked down more than eight times for stabbings. I was placed in the hole for transfer and was being treated as if I were being disciplined. I wasn’t able to order proper hygiene without having a medical condition. Chemicals to keep cells and shower clean came only once in a blue moon. Finally after four months I was able to order hygiene.</br></br>

Medical request were being ignored, mail was being rejected for no explainable reasons, mental health was doing nothing for anybody but ignoring any requests or concerns. Everything was always blamed on COVID-19 reasons why nobody can get help for anything.</br></br>

I gave up altogether asking staff for anything. After three months it was clear nobody gave a shit ‘cause at the end of the day staff gets to go home to their families. More than half are only there for the paycheck.</br></br>

It was a horrible experience. Food services were poor, portions were small. Some meals had fruit flies or just straight up two baked potatoes a piece of bread. Some veggies were considered a dinner. No toppings just two potatoes. And that like everything else was blamed on not having inmates to cook normal meals ‘cause they were locked down ‘cause of COVID procedures. So staff replaced inmates.</br></br>

The AC systems would shut down for three/more days. Had no ventilation whatsoever. Work orders for backed up sewage systems would take three weeks for an answer. It was definitely mind-blowing the things that truly happen on this side of the fence.
