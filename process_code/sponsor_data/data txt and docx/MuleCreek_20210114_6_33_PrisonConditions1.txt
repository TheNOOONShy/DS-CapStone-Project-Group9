This story was told by a person incarcerated in Mule Creek. </br></br>


Caller: No doctors or nothing at that time in that building came around to check on you or nothing. The nurses, they just come around just for the daily you know, med stuff, if you get regular meds or whatever. </br></br>


And when you ask them questions, you know, “Am I positive or negative?” Or whatever the case may be. They just brush you off and it’s just, they don’t know or they don’t have the answers um, “Ask the next watch, ask third watch, or that’s not their job, you gotta talk to a doctor.”
