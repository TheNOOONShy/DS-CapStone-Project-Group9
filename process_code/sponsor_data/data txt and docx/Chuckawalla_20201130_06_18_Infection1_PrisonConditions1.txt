This story was told by a person incarcerated at Chuckawalla.</br></br>

UCI: And what is the current COVID-19 situation at your facility?</br></br>

Caller: Right now, the outbreak - we had a, we've had a couple outbreaks, but it's starting to - the numbers are starting to go down.</br></br> 

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>

Caller: As far as I know, I think that we only have 70 cases left.</br></br>

UCI: Okay, and what is going okay? Or what is going well within the facility?</br></br>

Caller: Oh. What's going well?</br></br>

UCI: Yeah. Like, are they doing, are they like following protective like protocol like wearing masks and like hand sanitizer and all of that?</br></br>

Caller: They seem to be doing a lot more of that now. They weren't before, you know, all the outbreaks that we had. It didn't seem like anybody was taking it serious.</br></br>

Especially the officers. They, they would interact and talk to people. They just didn't take it very seriously.</br></br>

But now they are, they're required to wear surgical masks. They can no longer wear, you know, their issued or purchased face masks.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>

Caller: Now they're required to wear the surgical masks. But they didn't do that before. And I think we've had three or four outbreaks, and this is the third outbreak, I think.</br></br> 

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>

Caller: And it just doesn't seem like it's gone real well.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: So, we were in the last yard. We're on Delta yard. We're the last yard, and all the other yards had basically gotten it at the same time. Which is four other yards.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>

Caller: They had the outbreak, they basically quarantined them over there. And then they had a second outbreak on C yard. What they did is they emptied one of our buildings. We have three buildings on our yard.</br></br> 

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br> 

Caller: They emptied one of our buildings, which is D-11. And they used that as quarantine. However, when a building gets infected, which there's about 192 individuals in this box.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br> 

Caller: I call it a box cause that's what it is.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah.</br></br> 

Caller: And there's no social distancing. It's just impossible. We're only - the most we can usually be in our cubes, and stay apart is three feet.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br> 

Caller: So, they emptied D-11, and when they have a positive case, they automatically move that positive case to D-11. And then they take everyone else in the building, and they spread them out through the prison. They put them in education, the classrooms where they emptied it out and put beds in. They put them in family visiting.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: Basically, when they do that, they're, they're, they've increased, you can see it. The numbers increase rapidly.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br> 

Caller: It seems, I'm not saying, and I don't really know if they are. But it seems like they're purposely trying to infect people. Because common sense says if you take people in the building and then you consolidate them and put them into smaller rooms, less well ventilated. I mean, this thing is pretty much in the air when you talk, and you breathe, and you sleep.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah.</br></br> 

Caller: And these areas were not very good. But not only that, now you're sick.
