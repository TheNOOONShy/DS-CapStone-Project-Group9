This letter was written by a person incarcerated at CMC (California Men's Colony).</br></br> 

In late December 2020, CMC correctional officers that worked in all the dorms tested positive for COVID-19. Yet, CDCR failed to do the required contact tracing to determine which inmates had been exposed to these officers in order to quarantine them away from the rest of the unexposed inmates, in order to prevent the mass spread of the virus. Not surprisingly, all inmates were infected with the virus. Last count being 2,400 inmates.</br></br>
 
CDCR apparently and deliberately failed to perform contact tracing in order to cover up the officers' failure to wear their masks at all times which obviously resulted in their first mass infection of each other, and then their natural spread to all inmates assigned to the dorms they worked.</br></br>
 
The South African variant- which is more infectious and deadly- that even the vaccine does not protect against, has been identified in Northern California. It is a matter of time for this variant to reach CMC which is located in Central California coast.</br></br>
 
I fear further infection. I've already suffered through heart pain, very painful body aches, headaches, coughing, and faintness, from the first preventable infection. Another infection by a more infectious and dangerous variant, is just frightful and dreadful.</br></br>
 
CDCR’s management of the COVID-19 pandemic is deliberately cold-blooded, towards inmates' lives and health. There will most certainly be more preventable inmate deaths in California’s prisons from this deadly mutating virus.</br></br>
 
I am a non-violent offender serving a sentence that may well have been a death sentence.</br></br>
 
When did the death penalty become the sentence for a non-violent offense in the state of California? When did a United States citizen become classified as less than human, upon a felony conviction? When did California state prisons become death chambers?</br></br>
 
What value does a prisoner’s life carry?
