This story was told by a person incarcerated at Mule Creek. </br></br>


Caller: After I was put into quarantine I didn’t receive any medical treatment or anything even after I was tested three times. I didn’t receive any medical treatment as I had said even after I tested positive. Most people received medication from the doctors and whatnot and I never received nothing. </br></br>


I had put in medical slips and I asked to know what my diagnosis was if I was positive or negative and never got a response. Still to this day I have never seen a doctor, never received any medication for it. </br></br>


My symptoms were shortness of breath, it was hard to breathe. I had diarrhea for about three days. I had panic attacks. It was just so hard to breathe, coughing um, it was just, it was just crazy. I was gone for about 25 days. Yeah, it was just crazy, it was, just plain crazy.
