Hello to you and your team. May this letter find you in good health and spirits. I appreciate your thought and consideration to reach out and take a moment to bring upon a smile and some joy. I hope to do the same to you as the best thing going on is strangers bringing each other happiness while enduring a hardship and the pandemic.</br></br> 

I hope to continue this correspondence, if possible, either with you or a team member. If not, I appreciate the time you invested into the gesture and concern expressed.</br></br>

Furthermore a bit about me, I am due to be released soon in June and have spent the past couple years incarcerated. I’m from a small town in the Central Valley. I am a Black and Mexican, with much time in the system as out. Now during such time there has been many opportunities for one to rehabilitate himself.</br></br>

Since the pandemic I have had many experiences in life. While I was trying to fight the allegations I faced in trial there was some numerous difficulties. In trying to obtain jurors as well has having multiple mistrials due to attorneys on both sides catching COVID or having contact, thus causing a setback in discovering innocence or guilt.</br></br> 

I also had a beautiful baby girl be born which was a health scare as she could’ve become ill or worse. I have lost a relative due to COVID-19 and fear losing more.</br></br>

Due to lack of health procedures I became infected as well seriously ill myself while quarantined in a segregated two man cell. At times being an inmate we are not treated as normal humans. Overall this has been life changing for those inside and out.</br></br> 

Visits have been cancelled for most of the year leaving inmates without seeing their loved ones at home. Be it spouses, kids, parents, and attorneys for those with appeals pending.</br></br>

We have limited movement and activity and no access to rehabilitative programs or schooling, hence not being able to better ourselves. For some it’s bearable. For others it’s difficult. At the end of it I’m in good health and able to share my situation with you.</br></br> 

I hope to hear back from you. Sending a smile back.
