This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Stockton.</br></br>As for me personally, I have been coping with this pandemic in a positive way. Due to the fact this institution has been strongly competent and effective in reducing the spread of COVID-19, during the height of its unknown impact and/or nature. CHCF, head of operations, (that is what I will call them), from the beginning had quickly stopped the interactions of inmates, going from one section to another.</br></br>And by doing this was good because, if not the spread of COVID-19 would have been worse. Each building was isolated. Later on, there was inmates getting sick, but this was also dealt with with quick response. Yes, some inmates were affected by COVID-19, and my prayers goes out to their loved ones.</br></br>As the days and months pass on, all the inmates who were not infected by COVID-19 were offered a chance to get vaccinated (a quick guess, I would say two out of a hundred inmates opt not to take the test). I felt very safe after getting both shots. I would also like to add that I appreciate the medical staff and out of state volunteers, the captain(s), lieutenants(s), assistant warden(s), warden, and all other staff members who work tirelessly in keeping everyone safe.</br></br>
