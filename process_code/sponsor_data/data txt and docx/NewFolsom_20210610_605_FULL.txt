This story was told by a person incarcerated at New Folsom.</br></br>

UCI: Okay, great. So, tell me about what it's been like for you.</br></br>

Caller: Oh, well, we've been in lockdown a lot. They’d kind of shut the program down basically for security reasons and health reasons. They were, in a way everybody just wondering – well, at the beginning wondering what was going to happen, what was going on, you know. So, we were just posted, I guess, all the prisoners, on the news. We have a TV in here, I mean, that we watch and we were just concerned for our people, our family members.</br></br>

They came up with this idea that they would give us - everybody - a phone call, a free phone call, for those prisoners that can't afford to make a collect call. So, they can call their family members a week, and basically kind of help prisoners a lot because they were able to call their people and find out how they're doing, how their parents are doing.</br></br>

I was personally concerned about my parents because they're older. They're, you know, over 60. And it was more dangerous for them, according to the news. Me, myself, well, I wasn't really too concerned about myself because I been through a lot of stuff, and I basically was just being positive and being strong.</br></br> 

Just doing exercise and trying to be strong. But it was kind of worrying of other - it was kind of other people out there just being sick, getting sick and dying and stuff, you know.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, absolutely. At the beginning of the pandemic, were your parents notified of any changes, or was it kind of all of a sudden? You know, how did that affect them?</br></br>

Caller: No, they really were not notified, they were just keeping track. I guess that's why they gave us our phone calls for, so that we could alert them, let them know what's going on. My mom, as usual, I mean, she was concerned about us having masks in here. She wanted to send me a mask in the mail or something.</br></br>

I said, no, that's not allowed in prison. I said, "Don't worry. They were giving us masks." At first, I mean, everybody was just using a cloth. I mean, basically, that was a made-up mask that I guess they made, like, just with a rubber band and a piece of a cotton cloth.</br></br>

But, I mean, it was working. But then they started bringing in the N95 masks after some weeks after that. And in reality, to be honest, here in Sacramento, they did a good job in containing the virus because there were, reportedly, a few staff that got infected, and right away, they didn't let them come in to work.</br></br>

And there was a very minimum people that got infected here in this prison. It's not, you know, we didn't have bad luck like some other prisons that actually reported more infections. But, this prison did a really good job. And actually, I was one of the members that - porters at the time.</br></br>

They coached us how to clean the whole dayroom, they coached us how to clean the rails from the hallways, the rails from the stairs, the tables. It's a contaminated process that we were doing every morning, and they were actually training us to do that with a disinfectant.</br></br>

And basically, it was also something that we started doing for a little at the beginning, you know. But, other than that, I think that there was a few people there that they said they got infected, but they, it was mild. Like, they were positive, but they just left.</br></br>

They kept them separated in a TDA, that was a special unit where they keep them alone, by themselves. And they kept them there for, I guess, the quarantine process. And then, when they tested negative, they brought them back.</br></br>

But, right away, when anybody tests positive, they'll remove them from the building. They'll put them on a special unit where they were keeping them with a doctor in there and medical staff surveillance.</br></br>

But, I was actually wondering - I was going to write that - I mean, write to you guys instead, right, but I was just wondering if it was still on time to do it and how much time we had to do it.</br></br>

UCI: Oh, you mean like our phone conversation or how much time you would have to kind of write the letter and send it?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, yeah, just, to write it and to, you know, yeah, write it to you guys.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, absolutely. Oh.</br></br>

Caller: I was just going to - what was your -  you guys have to make a report, you guys writing a book, or what is it?</br></br>

UCI: It's not a book, it's actually already a website. It's a public website that I can give you the IP address for and, you know, your mom, or your dad, or family members can look it up, or yourself. But, you can take as much time as you need to write the letter. There's no timeline, so feel free to - you know, some letters we get are really, really long and then some are super short.</br></br>

So, just kind of depends on what your preference is. But, there's no timeline, there's no rush. We want you to feel comfortable kind of if you want to backtrack all the way to the beginning, you're welcome to do that, too. But, it's a public website, and it just documents all these stories that are like, yours and, you know, they're being told through letters and through conversations just like this.</br></br>

Caller: Oh, okay, okay. Yeah, very stressful moments. Basically, I myself, I'm right now housed in a unit with this mental disorder unit. I mean, basically, it's an EOP unit, which is people that have mental issues, they keep them separated in a unit. And this is where like, me myself, I have PTSD and major depression because I've been incarcerated for 19 years since I was 20 years old.</br></br>

So, I'm 39 right now. And basically, I'm kind of - I was just speaking to my parents and, I mean, I'm being hopeful that I should, there's new laws that I should be going home pretty soon. Like, you know, 2025, I'll be given, you know, the time that I was supposed to serve. But, I'm hoping shorter than that because of new laws, the juvenile laws that are coming into effect.</br></br>

So, that kind of pulls my hopes up. But, to be honest, there were people here - they’re just panicking and make you say that we're not going to make it. And it was just going to infect everybody in here, and there's no way about it, you know, that we can't contain it because the air conditioning here, it just - everybody breathes the same air because it just comes through one tube and just goes and spreads all over.</br></br>

So, they were saying - people were covering up their vents, they were covering the bottom of the doors. They would take their shoes off when they'd go in the cell and clean them up. I mean, everybody was just doing their own little thing to supposedly, you know, not to be infected.</br></br>

Clean up the phone every time we use the phone or something. Right now, every time here we use the phone, the staff gives you a wipe so you can wipe the phone with a disinfectant little wipe, right, that they give you. And, I mean, I think they did a good job containing the virus in this prison. I give them props for that. They were really concerned about - hello?</br></br>

UCI: Oh, no, yeah, I was going to say it sounds like the staff was regularly tested then.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah. Oh, the staff were being tested?</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, in the beginning-</br></br>

Caller: Yeah.</br></br>

UCI: You said, you know, not a lot of you got infected, so it sounds like staff was consistently being tested then.</br></br>

Caller: Oh, yeah. Right away, they were the ones that - every time they’ll come into the unit, they had to get a, they set up their own temperature, they’ll take your temperature. Just like a hospital, like you're going inside a hospital. They'll have masks right there. The staff reports to be sick of any cold or fever going up, they would not let them in at all.</br></br>

It's just they stopped the visits, actually physical visits for our family members, our girlfriends, you know, wife, they were not allowed to come in at all. And they're still not allowed up to this point right now. So, what they're doing right now is they started, they came up with this good idea in a way that is positive because they're going to allow us to have this, like, tablet sort now that I guess it's going to have a type of gadget, technology that we're going to be able to talk to family members maybe, like, once a week and be able to see them.</br></br>

But, it's actually going to happen. They're going to do it. Because that's the way a lot of people can afford to have - get visits because they live too far away. And they live too far away. So, basically, that's going to help us a lot.</br></br>

UCI: So -</br></br>

Caller: What if I - so, if I sent a letter over there, right, and I just write down your name on top of it, will you be able to receive that letter and continue the conversation? Because I got to go right now, they're kind of pushing me, right, the cops.</br></br>

UCI: Oh, yeah, go ahead. Yeah, go ahead. Just go ahead and write us, PrisonPandemic, and anyone will be able to get your story, and like  you can keep telling it. Totally. Thank you so much for sharing your story with me today.</br></br>

Caller: Okay, okay. Okay, thank you, bye.</br></br>

UCI: You're welcome. Bye.
