This story was told by a person incarcerated at Soledad. </br> </br>UCI: So, do you have any idea of what needs to be done to make the situation better?</br></br>

Caller: Well, first of all, they should have no housing unit with more than 90 percent occupancy. That's the first thing because we live - everything we do is in groups. They have too many people in each facility, in each housing unit, of these prisons.</br></br> 

So, no matter what, there's no spacing. You can't even be in a cell by yourself. So, if they can get the prison system down to about 95 percent of occupancy, that would, that would be the only thing that could work.</br></br>

The other thing is if there's a vaccine that comes along, but the problem is before the vaccine, all the employees here go home at night. So they're exposed to COVID, and then they work in here. So we get - they have one nurse that infected like 10 people because she got it, and she was handing out their medication, and so they - everybody that she handed out their medication with got COVID.</br></br>

So one of our biggest things in here, and there's a thing going on with this stimulus check that they said inmates can get it. So that's gonna help these guys because a lot of guys don't have money, and they can't buy the supplies they need. They have to borrow or barter for Ôem.</br></br> 

Most of the most important things is like toothpaste, deodorant, stuff like that. You have to buy all that stuff. They don't give that to you.</br></br>

There's a perception that when they say they pay $80-$90,000 per inmate that they're actually giving us that. The inmate receives about $1,800 worth of services, that's including your medical, power to the cell, and all that, and your meal plan.</br></br> 

They - the meal plan, they pay - they budget $3.50 per day per inmate for three meals. So you can imagine what size those meals are.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: You have people here that weigh anywhere from, you know, 175 to 250 pounds. That's one of the things, hunger is a real issue in here. You know, mental health is - if you put in to see the psych, they come and get you immediately, that's not a problem.</br></br>

We've only had one death at this prison for COVID-19, and we've only had one suicide this year at this facility, which is kind of good because normally there's like five to 10 a year. So the mental health department, you know, they're really trying to help people. There's no visiting, so that makes people kind of feel weird.</br></br>

But one of the things is if they can give us some type of care packages, you know, with hygiene.
