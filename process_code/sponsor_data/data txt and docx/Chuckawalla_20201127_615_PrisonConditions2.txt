This story was told by a person incarcerated at Chuckawalla.</br></br>Caller: So, I remember being on this particular yard, on yard B, and we had a particular lieutenant that worked here and, you know, took good care of the yard, was a very respectful man, and so forth. And, you know, he received word that they wanted to put some infected people on the yard. And he said, “Well not on my watch,” you know?</br></br>
And so, you know, due to how people are sometimes a little cozy and so forth, word got around that, you know, he actually emailed Sacramento about it. And when word got back here to the prison, they're like "Who the hell do you think you are?" You know? And now he doesn’t work on the yard anymore.</br></br>UCI: Mmm.</br></br>Caller: And so that’s one thing. And once every other yard was infected, everybody here - they supposedly, a court order mentioned that they were gonna have to come close down a building in the prison, an entire building, and make it a quarantine building.</br></br>
So out of the three infected yards, they decide, "Oh well, you know, let's decide that on that one yard that’s not infected." So, they took 170 plus inmates that were in that building.</br></br>UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>Caller: Negative and they spread them all out to the infected yard, closed the building down, and then started bringing the infected people into the yard in there, into that building. Even though they did keep them quarantined, they didn’t give them yard or nothing. So, they fed them in the building and all this.</br></br>
They continued to take staff that worked in that building and allowed them to come over to work in our buildings. You know, like for overtime and so forth.</br></br>UCI: Right.</br></br>Caller: On top of that, they, I know for certain they've allowed three staff from this building in particular.</br></br>UCI: Yeah.</br></br>Caller: To show up to work, positive. And I know that’s the case because they came in and walked them off. You know, they had to assist them where supposedly when they do test, they email them to know the results.</br></br> 

And if they don’t check the email, then they get right back into work and then when someone realizes, “Hey nobody checked the email. Oh, let's go”, you know? So.</br></br>UCI: Yeah.</br></br>Caller: Very, you know, very faulty system there.</br></br>UCI: Yeah.</br></br>Caller: I guess they allowed one of the kitchen cops to go to work, infected. Got all the kitchen workers from that building, building ten infected so now they started moving people from ten block to all these little, small locations that they had available.
