Caller: The conditions are pretty bad, not much social distancing, it’s a lot of loud behaviors, kind of obnoxious. It gets pretty, I don’t know, humid in here, it can get hot. There’s not a lot of, they haven’t given us a meal, a normal meal in months now. It’s mostly just bologna sandwiches pretty much, for the last four months, three or four months.</br></br>


UCI: Mhm.</br></br>


Caller: And they haven’t been running the courts consistently so I haven’t had a court date in months.</br></br>


UCI: Wow, yeah. I know that can be stressful. How has the vaccination situation been at the facility since they started vaccinating people?</br></br>


Caller: I finally got a vaccine. I got the Pfizer vaccine. I got it about, five days ago. And I’m hoping it expedites the trial process and makes everything, help me with my court date.</br></br>


UCI: Mhm. And has everyone been vaccinated up there?</br></br>


Caller: No, no not everyone has been vaccinated. But some people who signed up for vaccinations have been vaccinated.</br></br>


UCI: Mhm. And how has the COVID situation at your facility affected your loved ones?</br></br>


Caller: I contact my loved ones through basically here. The COVID situation, they say, my father has, was the first one to get COVID-19. And he was pretty distraught about it, he was worried that he could be one of the, were on the [unintelligible] afraid that he could be on the sicker side. And he basically, he just got vaccinated, but he’s on the second dose and he feels sick from the second dose, the side effects from the vaccine. My sister is getting the vaccine, I don’t think she ever got COVID-19, but she’s getting vaccinated for it.</br></br>


Caller: And those are the only two people I’ve been able to contact on the outside. And my dad has been out of work, so he’s been collecting unemployment this entire time. And my sister has part-time employment I think, with the office. The office gets, it kind of shut down that she works at, but she still is able to work part-time.</br></br>


UCI: Mhm. And how have you been coping with the crisis?</br></br>


Caller: I’ve been writing a lot, journaling, I read the newspaper to keep up to date, try to keep my brain alert. And I try to exercise and remain hygienic and be as, you know, aware of the social distancing as I can. And hopefully it helps, you know, with the pandemic overall when I get out of here.</br></br>


UCI: Yes, that’s good, self-care is good. So, self-care is good. So what would you say could make the situation better at this facility?</br></br>


Caller: They could improve the food, definitely. We need hot water, we need a little bit more social distancing, and we need more medical attention overall. The feeling we get around here can get us kinda nervous, being some vulnerable to the pandemic. And, I mean, we need, the security is good here but it can be kind of difficult to know who’s got COVID-19, who’s sicker with COVID-19, versus [unintelligible] who’s not as sick with COVID-19. And yeah, it’s kind of, call it paranoia I guess.</br></br>


UCI: Yes. Okay, is there anything else you would want the people to know about your experience there?</br></br>


Caller: I need bail. I haven’t gotten cash bail. Really, because of the pandemic and I really need to get bail. And I’ve been incarcerated for about 16 months now almost. And yeah, basically just, you know, I’ve just been kind of isolated. And, feeling, you know, unemployed is difficult and to get a job when I get out of here is difficult. And having to deal with all that sickness itself is really, can be quite stressful and can really take a toll on the mind and body over time.
