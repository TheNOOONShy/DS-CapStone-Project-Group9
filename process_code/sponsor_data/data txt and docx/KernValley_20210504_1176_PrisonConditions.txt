This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Kern Valley State Prison.</br></br>

I respect your project and hopefully I hear about you again. I’ve experienced so much till this day and have just about a lot to talk to you about this pandemic. When I heard about the great pandemic I was wondering and thinking about how it came upon. It felt so unreal, and I heard that it wasn’t real and so on. It’s been hard for some of us concerning right housing and right treatment and safety.</br></br>

At the beginning it wasn’t really so much, but soon as outside patients were bringing in the disease it really started affecting us. Like establishing right housing and so on. Safety inside was really a worried cause there’s so much you can do.</br></br>

About the vaccinations it’s been working well. The staff,nurses, etc. are really attentive to your care. Hopefully my story helps, hope to hear from you again, Bye.
