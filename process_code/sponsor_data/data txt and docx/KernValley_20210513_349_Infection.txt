It was a bummer visits got shut down, but I understand the precautions CDCR implemented so an outbreak wouldn’t occur. In October I got real real sick, but it was from something called “Valley Fever” and I almost passed away from it. While in the hospital and being treated for the “Valley Fever”, people were being admitted to the hospital from other prisons with COVID-19 and people were starting to receive positive tests. I tested negative, but when I was released and sent to the infirmary, I tested positive for COVID-19, and it threw me for a whirlwind. I honestly believed I was going to get real real sick and pass away. I didn’t know what to think but I was so concerned for my family and if I died what was to become of them and would they be able to cope with the passing of me ?
