As far as I know, only two or three inmates have tested positive on this yard. But quite a few C.O.’s and free staff (contracted workers) have tested positive for COVID-19. If anyone is responsible for the spread of the virus into facilities, it is them. Because they go home every day and come back to work, while we stay here.</br></br>

I, myself, had to be quarantined for two weeks; because I was “Exposed” to COVID-19 through a free staff (physical therapist). She was asymptomatic and did not know she was positive for COVID-19, so she was still seeing patients. Since I came in contact with her during a physical therapy session, the facility took “precautionary measures,” and had me quarantined. Which means I had to pack all of my personal property and move to another block for two weeks.</br></br>

Even though it had been about a week and a half to two weeks since my last physical therapy session. The most interesting part of it all, is that I was in a cell with my celly for close to two weeks, yet they only quarantined me. Which doesn’t make sense, because if I was exposed, and had indeed been positive, that means I would have also exposed my celly. I wasn’t even tested for COVID-19 until after I had been in quarantine for about a week and a half, thankfully the results came back negative.</br></br>

No one would’ve ever imagined that visiting would come to a complete stop due to a pandemic. Being able to visit with our loved ones and friends allows us to maintain ties to society. Not to mention the comfort and peace of mind they bring, with the knowledge of not being alone throughout this period of confinement which we are currently subjected to. For those of us who don’t get visits very often, a rare opportunity to get a visit may have passed us by.</br></br>

It might be a while after the pandemic when we could see our loved ones again. Since distance and other circumstances, such as conflict in scheduling, make it difficult for out family and friends to come visit us. The pandemic is just one more obstacle that gets in the way. Hopefully they resume in person visiting soon, it would be nice to hug and kiss our loved ones again. Especially those of us who have kids, not only do they comfort us, but we comfort them as well.</br></br>
