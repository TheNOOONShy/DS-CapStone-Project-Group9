This story was told by a person incarcerated at Chowchilla.</br></br>

Caller: We don't have any CNAs anymore. They took them away. And they left these RNs, and the RNs up here are real lazy, and the only people working are the LVNs, and all of them are getting ready to switch jobs because they're working on the desk. The RNs are still lazy, except for two. Well, actually one, who works himself to the bone.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>

Caller: I can't get to the restroom by myself, so a lot of times now I'm left to just pee on myself until they get a chance to get to me.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>

Caller: And that's not right.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>

Caller: And let me see what else. This new doctor, he's not a real good doctor. I have phantom pains really, really bad, and I need a nerve medicine to stop them. And I was taking Neurontin, but if you don't have seizures, they took your Neurontin from you. So I've been left in pain bad enough to cry for about two months now.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>

Caller: The last thing I tried was that Keppra, and the Keppra messed my liver up real bad. I was delirious when I got to the hospital. I didn't know nobody here, and I had known everybody for six or seven years.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>

Caller: My favorite LVN started crying. She said, you don't know who I am? I said, I'm â€“ oh, time for us to go? All right. I got to go. I'm sorry. I'll call back tomorrow.</br></br>

UCI: Okay. Okay.</br></br>

Caller: Bye.</br></br>

UCI: Bye-bye.
