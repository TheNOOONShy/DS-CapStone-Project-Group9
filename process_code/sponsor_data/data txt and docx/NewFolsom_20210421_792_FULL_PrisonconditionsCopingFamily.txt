This letter was written by a person incarcerated at New Folsom.</br></br>

Greeting,</br></br>

Your little letter was well received! Thank you for your kind words. It’s not too often, where a person receives a letter from a stranger with encouraging words.</br></br>

So to get to your questions. How do I cope during this COVID-19 crisis. To get a better understanding of my pant of view is really hard to explain, but the best way to put it is, like were in the military. If you are not strong in your mind, the average person would probably take his own life.</br></br>

There is a lot of ugliness around us. You cannot let anything or anybody trouble you. For myself, I cut all communication with all my loved ones.</br></br>

As you know, I been in prison for the last 29 years and to me. It is not fair to my family members to suffer for my choices I choose for myself. And yes, I love my family whole-heartedly.</br></br>

During this crisis, this prison was put on lockdown, which means – no movement. Breakfast, lunch, dinner was brought to our cells. This prison is two-man cells so the person you live with became family you get to know each other as time goes on. I’m cell up with a young man, and I’m up there in my age, so he treats me with a lot of respect, and I am thankful for that.</br></br>

I guess you can say I am one of the lucky ones. I work in the culinary so I work from 6 am till 4 pm, two shifts, so I am tired. But I am trying to help and do my part to make sure my fellow prisoner is safe from any dirtiness. I am cook at this prison so I am very clean in handling all food.</br></br>

Well, thank you for thinking about us, and I will end my letter the same way I begun, with all my respect.</br></br>

With respect.
