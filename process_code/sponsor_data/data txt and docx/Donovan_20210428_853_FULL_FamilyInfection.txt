I know this cause you pick me. You will be happy. Just keep doing what you're doing. I believe in you, no I believe in us.</br></br>Far as COVID-19 goes for me, it's just been a lot of studying and working out. Yes, I miss my family and their visits but I can feel them. Both me and my family, know this chapter of my life is coming to a close. I'll be with them at home shortly, God is so good.</br></br>I am so sorry I don't have a sad story about COVID-19 I can tell you. I do feel for the family that it affected, I pray for them a lot.
