This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Donovan.</br></br>

This social distancing is cruel and unusual, especially when I’m already separated from my loved one as it is. I mean how much more do I need to be separated? I’m in the Otay part of San Diego. Just north of the border at Donovan State Prison. And I’m from the East county.</br></br>

My mother is 15-20 minutes away and I don’t have any access to her. If you could give her a word from me and tell her I miss her.</br></br>

Please. It’s imperative. She’s worried sick about me, we basically been inseparable, my whole life up until I was 20 and came to prison. We have never been apart this long. I don’t know where I’d be without my mother. She’s done everything for me, and I love her to death.</br></br>

Just an interesting fact, but out in the world, when a mother gives birth “animal,” the baby really can’t survive. Without the mother, because like I do, it depends on her. And when you take that away you're pretty much deprived. She’s all I communicate with, and they cut the line of communication.</br></br>

If you’ve been watching the news, a couple months ago, they were protesting in the part of town where I was born and raised, and brought up. In the city of La Mesa which is in the East County. They had a riot, that was sparked by the assault of a Black male, by police officer, which later surfaced on the news, and created an uproar in my town.</br></br>

Caging a stand off with thousands rushing the La Mesa police department/precinct. Later sending escalating mobs into the streets of La Mesa setting fires to different buildings, vandalizing property, looting, and setting fires.</br></br>

My dearest mother’s name is [redacted]. She stays right around that area. It caught my attention because it was interesting to see that, with all that’s been going on. I try to pay attention to the different effects, and the toll it takes during those times and how we react and adjust to the different changes in our community.</br></br> 

And what I seen, and what I can say from that, is a whole lot has changed.
