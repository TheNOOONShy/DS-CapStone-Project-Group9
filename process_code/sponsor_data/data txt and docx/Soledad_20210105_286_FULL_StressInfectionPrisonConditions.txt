Dear PrisonPandemic,</br></br>

Hello, I received your mail on January 8, 2020 via institutional mail, as I tested positive December 10, 2020 for COVID-19 here at CTF in Soledad, CA. I was put into isolation on December 13, 2020. Til then waiting for the results I was allowed to walk around, possibly infecting others, and I wasn’t the only inmate.</br></br>

Hundreds of other inmates were allowed to do the same, pass out food, housing unit supplies, for three days! Correctional staff, administrative staff allowed us all to infect one another. Please remember that this virus is a community virus, so it was brought in by staff. Things are very, very bad.</br></br>

I’m dealing with survivor's guilt right now because sooo many people did not make it through. Your letter allows me to know that outside of family, somebody else cares. Now we are being treated as if we are the one brought the virus inside the prison.</br></br> 

They have never shut the program down when there wasn’t any virus inside. That was the time to treat it as if it was here. I know that it’s hard for everybody and their families, but when you’re responsible for the most vulnerable, like the elderly in nursing homes and us, because there’s hardly any place to keep six feet distance in here.</br></br>

I take responsibility for decisions I make in my life. Administration, correctional staff these are people that we will refuse to accept the blame that this virus getting inside is their fault. And it’s very chilling to hear their excuses they’re giving to the courts and for California Assembly up in Sacramento.</br></br>

Your project has really, really touched me. Made me feel like it really is gonna be okay. To stay strong and positive things. Thanks sooo very very much!</br></br>

God Bless.
