This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Kern Valley State Prison.</br></br>

Personal experiences I’ve went through in here or the issues inside prison? Because there are a lot of overlooked health and safety issues here where I’m currently housed “Delano, CA.” I am currently housed in administrative segregation due to being a victim of an attempted murder.</br></br>

The system is a strange place, a lot goes on behind these walls. I am interested in speaking with you. I have a lot of stories and experiences I’ve been through behind these walls.</br></br>

This address I’m writing you, is this your place of work? Do you have another address to write to? The phone number you gave me in the letter, do I just ask about you? However you wanna do this lets get started. I got nothing but time.</br></br>

Take care of yourself and be safe.
