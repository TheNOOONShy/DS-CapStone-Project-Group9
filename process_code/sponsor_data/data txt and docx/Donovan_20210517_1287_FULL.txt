Hello PrisonPandemic,</br></br>
I hope this letter finds you and your loved ones in the very best of health, mind, and spirit. Thanks for writing, I welcome all female interaction. I've been incarcerated 21 years for robbery and no I didn't hurt anyone it was a liquor store in the Bay Area. I'm not bitter though, especially not right now cause I'll be home next year, actually in about 11 months. See I haven't received any mail from a woman in so long, I'm telling my life story huh.</br></br>
[Redacted] did not do a very good job protecting us from the coronavirus, nor dealing with the pandemic. This place was not prepared. At the beginning and the way up to like two and a half months ago CDCR was only doing temperature checks on their officers going in and out of the facility. And as far as vaccines they just made that available to all prisoners in February.</br></br>
I understand you can't force people to get vaccinated but there still should be consequences for refusing the covid-19 test that should be segregated for ten to four days. The officers were only being mandated to test after they showed symptoms that's bull. Anyways, lately RID has been on top of their game, but my concern is there are still inmates walking around here coughing and thinking they're too cool to wear a mask.</br></br>
Ain’t that about [Redacted], and they just had an outbreak of coronavirus in an A yard about a month and a half ago, after they resumed contact visiting. Privileges saving a visitor infected an inmate, really? how that happened, I thought all visitors allowed in the facility have to show a fully vaccinated card. Hmm, and we’ve been getting punked out of a lot of programs since then, because of shortage of staff. Got to be COVID19 related, so go figure so?
