Is this the end of plagues as we know it? Since the 1900 there has been plagues. Smallpox, Spanish flu, and now the coronavirus-19. What’s next?</br></br>

What epidemic could kill millions of people over and over again? Only time will tell.</br></br>

I think some plagues are manmade. When others are from parasites and bacteria causing major virus, infections, and diseases. The world as we know it has always been a changing place. War, earthquakes, and disasters.</br></br>

But through it all people have helped, loved, and prayed for strangers, enemies, and even government that don’t have a care in the world for us or each other.</br></br>

As the right wing fight the left wings and the left wings fight the right wing no one wins. If everyone lose the fight for life where people are suffering, dying and even starving in our own United States.</br></br>

It’s taught me a lot about caring and loving where there is none or showing it. How important the next prison is to us and humanity in the USA for everyone to take care of themselves and each other.</br></br>

That’s who wins. All of us together as a nation. God Bless America.
