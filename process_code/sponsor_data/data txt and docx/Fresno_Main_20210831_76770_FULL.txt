This story was told by a person incarcerated at Fresno County Jail.</br></br>

Caller: Well, yeah. I've been here in the Fresno County Jail. I've experienced the outbreak of the mumps and now, you know of course, the coronavirus pandemic.</br></br>

And I, you know, I read all the articles. I do get the paper, and I read the articles on how the sheriff is saying that she's doing this and she's doing that, you know, to protect us. And I've been on COVID-19 lockdown. I'm on lockdown, as we speak, as we're speaking right now, you know what I mean, and I think it's too late in the pandemic for us to be on lockdown.</br></br>
 
The jail should have a procedure in place to protect inmates like me, you know what I mean? Every time we get put on COVID lockdown, you know, our courts stop, we don't have no movement, nothing. You know what I mean?</br></br>

They, you know, they give us one free phone call to our family. You know, and they just started the visits to where one family member can come for an hour, you know, so I don't think that the sheriff's doing a good job because they - it's too late in the pandemic for us to keep getting re-exposed to the coronavirus. You know, COVID-19 was earlier, you know what I mean?</br></br> 

Yeah, in the beginning, you can expect, you know, to have to go through that because they have to get a handle on how to, you know, adjust to the pandemic, but a year or something later, you're still trying to adjust to the pandemic? Yes. Like we're on lockdown, you know, as I speak, and I think there's three other pods, you know, housing units on this floor that's been re-exposed to COVID-19, you know.</br></br>

And it's my - I feel like this that once you realize that there's a problem and you get the proper information, you got the money from the government, you know, you got the information from all the, you know, doctors and stuff, you know how they do that. So, and I know the main thing that, you know, my family was telling me that they had to do, that if my family member came from Texas, they had to shelter-in-place for 14 days before they got exposed to the public.</br></br>

The jail's not doing that, you know what I mean? When a new inmate comes in, if they quarantine that inmate for the required shelter-in-place time, you know what I mean, they're doing their part at that point. If something just happens to sneak through and we get re-exposed at that point, that's just fate. It's meant to be.</br></br>

But when you've got inmates that's coming straight from the receiving and straight into the pods, and you say, "Well, where do you come from?" "Oh, we came straight from booking." They're not protecting us, you know what I mean? They're playing Russian roulette, you know, with our lives, you know what I'm saying?</br></br>

And I'm saying it's at a point where we don't have no one speaking for us, you know?. Because, you know, I've been in the jail, like I say, since [redacted]. I shouldn't be getting exposed to nothing. I haven't seen the sun, you know what I mean?</br></br> 

So, I don't get the chance to put myself in jeopardy. I'm under the control and care of the Fresno County Jail and the sheriff of Fresno County. So, I'm saying it's their responsibility to protect me from these viruses or whatever the case may be. I'm saying when you get put on quarantine, right now, there's no one's testing positive.</br></br> 

I can just go up to the doctor and tell the doctor, "I have a fever." A fever will get us put on quarantine for 14 to 21 days, and by being put on quarantine for 14 to 21 days, that means everybody in this housing unit doesn't get to go to court. Their due process of law stops. You know what I mean?</br></br>

And I don't think nothing can change the Constitution. The Constitution says I have a right, you know, to a public and speedy trial, you know? And I'm saying that's not being provided, right now with the pandemic. And I'm saying that's what the money was for.</br></br> 

That's why the government gave each state money, you know, to make courtrooms to be efficient, to respect the rights of the citizens. Yeah, we're in jail, true enough, you know what I mean, and that's our fault. But we still have rights, and those rights are not being protected, you know what I mean, by the courts or by nobody else. You know what I mean? They don't care. We're just in the shuffle.</br></br>

You know? I think the sheriff should be held accountable for that, you  know? Someone needs to step up and be like, "What about these individuals right here?" You know? The pre-trial detainees. It's kind of like, stuck, we're just stuck. You know what I mean? And we could be put on - we don't have no say-so.</br></br>

No one don't comes and tell us, "Hey, look, this guy did this." Or whatever the case may be,  "we have a case positive in your pod." They don't - no one comes and say that. They just come and put an orange paper on the window, and we're on lockdown for the next 14 to 21 days.</br></br>

So, I - you know, the sheriff don't even send the medical staff in like they did with the mumps. With the mumps, the medical staff came in and they spoke to us. You know what I mean? They came from pod to pod, and they spoke to us and told us how to do this and do that. With the pandemic, they don't do that.</br></br>

You know what I mean? When - earlier last year, when right around when it first started when we first got exposed to the COVID-19, they came in every day, and they sprayed two or three times a day. They came in with this spray, and they sprayed, but here lately, when we've been getting re-exposed, they ain't even doing that. The officers are coming in without even their protective gear on.</br></br> 

They just wear a mask. They ain't wearing a white uniforms like they normally did when it first started. You know what I mean? And I'm saying that I can go to the dentist for a toothache, the dentist can say I have a fever, I can go on Saturday, and he can wait until Tuesday to tell someone that I have a fever, and we're back on COVID-19 lockdown.</br></br> 

A fever is normal when you have a toothache. It's dealing with pain. So, I'm saying they need to be able to come up with a system to differentiate what is a COVID-19 symptom, you know what I mean, or when is it just a common cold?</br></br>

The building is cold. Everybody, you know, walks around with a blanket over them, you know what I mean, and they're not in bed. So, they keep the living unit cold. So, at any given time, you're coming from the shower and this and that, you can get a cold and have a fever. But that don't mean you have, that don't mean you have COVID-19.</br></br>

We just got put on COVID-19 lockdown because an inmate went to the dentist on a Saturday. They came on a Tuesday, put us on COVID-19 lockdown because he had a fever. But he's been in the county jail for over a year and a half. If he had been an inmate that had just came in two or three days ago, I can understand being - having a precautionary, putting us on COVID-19, and having everybody tested or whatever the case may be.</br></br> 

But he's been in the county jail for over a year and a half. So, him having a fever is not from no COVID-19. It's from him having a toothache. They don't have no type of policy to where they're differentiating; you know what I mean?</br></br>

I wrote the grievance already. I went through the process of the grievance. They denied it, talking about their policy, they haven't done nothing wrong. Well I'm not concerned about what you did wrong. What have you done right?</br></br> 

That's my question. What have you done right to keep me from being re-exposed six times since the pandemic started to COVID-19 and I've been in the jail for over four years? I can't re-expose myself. When I leave the housing - when I leave the housing unit, I have my mask on.</br></br> 

You know what I mean? I go through protocols that the government has set up. You know what I mean? When I leave my housing unit, I have my mask on. When I go to court, I have my mask on. We have virtual court, but yet they're stopping our courts. What's the purpose of virtual court?</br></br>

I've been sitting in the courtroom, and I've seen a guy, in court, that's in Wasco State Prison. So, if you can give that guy - protect his rights of going to court, and he's in Wasco State Prison, and he's going to court in Fresno County Jail virtual, why can't you do that to inmates that you place on COVID-19 lockdown in Fresno County Jail? Why can't you fix up a designated area, you know what I mean, for courts? For the lawyers to come and stuff like that?</br></br>

The judges aren't in the courtroom. The district attorneys are not in the courtroom. Everybody's on the TV. Only body that's in the courtroom, most of the time, maybe your lawyer and the bailiff, and if there's any other witnesses that might need to go if they're going to go to trial or preliminary hearing. But other than that, the judge is not in the courtroom.</br></br>

But they ask you to give up your right for the judge not to be in the courtroom. Why should I have to give up a right when it was your responsibility to use the money that the government gave you to make this process functionable for pre-trial detainees? We have a right. It's a right.</br></br> 

It's not no privilege. We have a right to go and face our accuser in a certain amount of time. Due process. And right now, Fresno County is not respecting the due process, you know, of pre-trial detainees. And you know, they could put us on COVID-19 lockdown anytime they want. You know what I mean?</br></br>

And from what I - and I have been here, they sent me to the COVID-19 lockdown unit, but I tested negative. So I asked, "Why am I over here? I tested negative. Why am I in the housing unit of COVID-19 positive people?"</br></br>

"Oh, you have to give us three positive tests before you can return back to population."</br></br>

"But I never tested positive in the first place, so why am I here?"</br></br>

"Well, we can't tell you that."</br></br>

You know, it's my medical. You know? You can talk to me about my medical issue. But they won't. They just put - they just move you at will. I don't know if it's a money thing or what, but what I do know is that four out of these six units on this floor is on lockdown. For being re-exposed to the COVID-19 virus, the Delta virus, whatever you want to call it, you know what I mean, and that's that.</br></br>

You know? They'll send a nurse around in the morning and talk about temperature checks, you know, and everybody is frustrated. They don't do the temperature check due to the simple fact we don't even know why we're on lockdown. The guy you took out of here has been in this housing unit with us for the last year, so how could he be COVID-19 positive, and he's been in the same pod with us for a year? If that's the case, there should be a lot more people laying down sick with those symptoms, and it's not.</br></br>

But you know, and that's what's going on in Fresno County Jail as far as the COVID-19 virus. I did recently send you guys a letter too. You should receive it in the next day or so. But I did write a letter, sent to - I addressed it to [redacted]. I do welcome, you know, your feedback and things like that. I have the number, and I will continue to call and keep you abreast on what's going on in Fresno County Jail.</br></br>
