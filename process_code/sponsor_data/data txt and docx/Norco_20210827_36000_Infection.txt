This story was told by a person incarcerated at Norco.</br></br>

Caller: Can you, do you want to hear my COVID story?</br></br>

UCI: Yes, yes, yes. Keep going.</br></br>

Caller: Okay. So, I was in prison, in Deuel Vocational Institute, which is a reception center, in 2019. In May of 2019, I went to Ad Seg. Do you know what Ad Seg is? It's a hole. It's Administrative Segregation.</br></br>

UCI: Okay.</br></br>

Caller: Are you following me?</br></br>

UCI: I've just, I've never heard of it.</br></br>

Caller: Okay. So, Ad Seg is like, when you get into trouble, you get into a fight, you go to the hole. You go to Ad Seg.</br></br>

UCI: Oh, okay.</br></br>

Caller: Can you hear me?</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, yeah, yeah.</br></br>

Caller: Okay. So, anyway. So, I go to Ad Seg. I'm in there, it's like May. It's around May, like May [redacted] I went to Ad Seg because I was involved in a riot, race riot, and [unintelligible]. And all of a sudden, I got, like, really sick, for like five to six days.I was just down and out.</br></br>

[unintelligible] just like, I had to have my celly, because we had cellmates, do everything. Answer the door, get our trays. And they have people that are mental health professional [unintelligible] that come around in there like, "Are you all right? Are you feeling all right? Do you feel like hurting yourself?" "No." "Do you hear voices?" "No."</br></br>

And like, my celly is at the door and I can't go to the door and look. [unintelligible] my celly and he's like, "Oh, he's just sick. He's sick." Long story short, I get called to medical one day. I never, I get called to medical one day. I never put in a medical request slip.</br></br>

And they're like, "Oh, so, we heard you came down with something." And I was like, "Yeah, I was really sick. But I didn't put in no medical request slip, so how did you even know I was sick?" Because I knew if I put in a medical request slip, it would take days for them to even see me. So, by the time I probably got seen, I would already be over what I thought was the flu.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>

Caller: And they were like, "Well, there's something going around. There's something going around and we're monitoring it." So, I believe that I caught COVID. I mean, it's called COVID-19 for a reason. It came out in 2019. I think I just, I got it.</br></br>

I don't know how. I was in Ad Seg. My celly didn't get it but I got it. Other people on the tier got it in other, random cells. So, I think I've been affected with COVID in 2019.</br></br>

I got out since then in 2020 and I didn't get it. Like, I was around it and I didn't catch it. But I've not been vaccinated.</br></br>

UCI: Was that 2020 May?

Caller: Was it in 2020 May? No, it was in 2019 May.</br></br>

UCI: Oh, 2019 May.</br></br>

Caller: Like May, June, July. Yeah.</br></br>

UCI: That was before the COVID-19 epidemic.</br></br>

Caller: Came out, right?</br></br>

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: But I swear I caught it, though. I experienced the symptoms. I'm Native American and I'm [unintelligible] Mexican. I don't ever get sick and I got sick like I've never been sick before. I had just taken the flu shot.</br></br>

UCI: Oh, what were your symptoms?</br></br>

Caller: I couldn't taste nothing, like food that I was eating. I was still eating. I couldn't taste nothing.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: I was fever, headache, sick, throwing up, diarrhea. Couldn't get up out of bed. Chest pains.</br></br>

Just felt like I, just sickness that you feel when you have never got sick in hella long and you're like, "I'm really sick. I can't wait until I'm better. I can't do nothing," type stuff.</br></br>

UCI: Those are all signature symptoms of COVID.
