This story was told by a person incarcerated at Chuckawalla.</br></br>

Caller: Well, okay. Well, where to start. I think the big part of why, like, a lot of the numbers are, like, really high in prison is because without getting into too many specifics, the facility isn't - it isn't designed for the type of quarantine or various health and safety measures that COVID-19 needs, you know?</br></br>We're living in - well, at least I am - a dorm of 100 and some odd people up to 192 right now and, you know, with - with what we know about COVID-19 is, you know, while you're indoors and with air circulation being what it is, you're more susceptible to being - well, to catching it if you are indoors.</br></br>That's why, you know, with all the restaurants and everything like that.</br></br>UCI: Right.</br></br>Caller: So with just one person getting it in a building, now that entire building has been exposed to - to the virus. And, so, at least at the facility that I'm at, you see the numbers just spike exponentially at one time because you - you'll get one positive, for example, we've had - just had - we've just had this - we've had two positives, and then the next thing we know, we're having 30 positives, 40, 100, and so on.</br></br>UCI: Okay. What - just a quick question: What facility are you currently housed at?</br></br>Caller: Chuckawalla Valley State Prison.</br></br>UCI: Okay. And, so, what - so did you say that you guys are housed, you know, up to more than 100 people.</br></br>Caller: Yeah.</br></br>UCI: Like do you think what is going on is okay?</br></br>Caller: No, not - not at all. It's - it - because what - what they - their policy - at least medical policy is right now is that they - somebody catches the virus and that's after, for example, they test - they tested us today. Well, they're not going to get the results back until probably Monday.</br></br>UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>Caller: So if one of us was positive in the building, we just - they just send us back to our building with the 190 something people that are in here, and now we've spent - whoever was positive has spent 72 hours exposing everybody in the building.</br></br>And, so, while a test is only a snapshot in time as if, okay, were you negative or positive on Friday, that is not necessarily the case for you being negative or positive on Monday.</br></br>UCI: Mm-hmm. And what is -</br></br> Caller: So -</br></br> UCI: And what is troubling you? Like, what's the most concerning aspect about everything?</br></br>Caller: You know, it's the - mainly it's - it's kind of the nonchalance that staff and - has - has with it, you know?</br></br>The - at least the custody staff. You know, a lot of the - the officers, they don't take the virus seriously. They see it as a - a - like they're - I know that - that part of it is if they catch the virus, then they get, like, 14 days paid leave. And, so, some of them that are younger are out and they don't care if they get it because they know they'll be paid for 14 days.</br></br>And, so, that puts the entire prison population at whatever prison they're working at in jeopardy.</br></br>UCI: Right. Right. And how - how do you think COVID-19 has been handled by your facility, I mean, since the beginning of the outbreak?</br></br>Caller: Well, that - that's in numerous ways, you know, all the self-help programs have stopped because of social distancing and they're not allowing volunteers into the prison.</br></br>All of the vocational programs have stopped. And any in-college classes that we had had going on that - that at least for this facility had -</br></br> Caller: - that had just started to ramp up, those are all - those have all been shut down.</br></br>So you really only have as far as, like, self-improvement wise is correspondence college courses going on. Everything else is at a standstill.</br></br>UCI: Mm-hmm. And - and, so -</br></br> Caller: That's - that's probably the big...</br></br> UCI: And, so, how is it being handled differently now? I know you've already kind of explained, you know, how it's being handled differently now, but, like, is there anything that, you know, that troubles you and concerns you about the mannerism that it's being handled now?</br></br>Caller: Is there anything that concerns me about the manner it's being handled?</br></br>UCI: Yeah.</br></br>Caller: Well, I think the big part of it that concerns me is - oh, man, that's a big question. You know, it's - it's how - how all of the - the guys in here, you know, how their lives - because it - the virus is very serious and, you know, while some guys will catch it and they'll get better, there are guys here that I know that are in the hospital right now.</br></br>And the manner that, you know, the custody staff is taking it, that medical is - they're doing what they can, but they're not helping really at all to - they're kind - it's almost begrudgingly, it feels, that they're doing anything just so that they can show on paper at least that they're doing something. I think that's probably the - the most concerning part of it.</br></br>UCI: And if possible, could you please tell us month-by-month how the situation has changed at your facility?</br></br>Caller: Oh, well, at the beginning of the pandemic, so about March-ish, you know, we here at Chuckawalla, we're - we're out in the middle of nowhere, so, you know, there wasn't - there wasn't a whole lot going on here; you know? We got locked down, but there wasn't - there was no cases for a while.</br></br>Going into the summer, though, two of the other yards here, they exploded really because of the dorm setting. And we're now the fourth - the fourth highest in coronavirus cases -</br></br>UCI: Wow.</br></br>Caller: - throughout the pandemic. And that was just over the course of months and the - just a month or two during the summer.</br></br>And then now going into the winter, my - it - it hit - there's four yards. It hit the - it hit A and B and then - and that was a few thousand cases right there. And then it hit just recently in about September, it really ran through C yard, and I'm on D yard, and it finally got to us. And, so, it's just the - because of how kind of spread out we are as far as we don't have any contact with the other yards, but the officers all bounce between the yards.</br></br>And, so, one positive officer can jump two yards and now he's infected both yards. So that was a big - a big thing here. And now it's just kind of running through - through our yard and we're probably going to - I don't think we'll make the third number - the - I don't think we're going to be number three, but we're still rising as far as coronavirus cases.</br></br>And then one of the other - I just recently learned on C yard that they're going through it again. They're getting another wave over there.</br></br>UCI: Oh, wow.</br></br>Caller: So it's - yeah, it's - it - it gets really bad when it does get bad.</br></br>UCI: And what would you think would make the situation at your facility better?</br></br>Caller:	Oh, man. I guess the big - the - the big thing that would make it better is, you know, the addressing on prison overcrowding, that's the big - the big one right there. That's - but all that can't happen, like, with the snap of a finger. I think if, you know, if the medical staff, they - they're not - at least here - they - they don't particularly follow the CDC guidelines as far as, like, we - we had somebody print them up and send them in as far as - as far as what to do with populations like ours, and they're really just kind of flying in the face of everything that they've said as far as even on the CDC website.</br></br>So even if I'm sure if they did just the minimum that the CDC says to do, then things would be better.</br></br>UCI: Right, right. And how has the COVID-19 situation at your facility affected your loved ones?</br></br>Caller: Well, I haven't seen my parents or my grandparents or any of my family, you know, in really this entire year.</br></br>I think I saw them last in January. And then - and then with everything in the pandemic, so going on a year now I haven't seen anybody. I've been able to talk to them on the phone. But other than that, I know that definitely weighs on my parents and my mom and my grandma in particular, my grandparents.</br></br>So - so that's - I know that's really tough on them and I know that's - that's really -</br></br> Caller: - really tough on the other guys here.</br></br>UCI: Yeah. And just - maybe just a quick another question?</br></br>Caller: Yeah.</br></br>UCI: How have you been coping with the crisis?</br></br>Caller: Just trying to get through it, you know, day-by-day. Just tryin' to create like a schedule, you know, just kind of scheduling my days out, work out, do some homework with college, and watch TV.</br></br>Keep myself busy as - as much as I can.</br></br>UCI: Okay. Okay. Well, it is now 5:54. Thank you very much for participating in PrisonPandemic. I'm ending this call with this recording. I appreciate everything you told us and I wish you the best of luck in everything.</br></br>Caller: All right. Thank you.</br></br>UCI: Thank you. Have a good night.</br></br>Caller: All right. All right. You, too.</br></br>UCI: Thanks. Bye-bye.</br></br>Caller: All right. Bye.
