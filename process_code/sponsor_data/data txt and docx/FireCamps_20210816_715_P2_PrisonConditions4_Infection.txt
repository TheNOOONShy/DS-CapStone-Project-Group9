This story was told by a person incarcerated at Fire Camp.</br></br> 

Caller: Gabilan fire camp is not an active fire camp at the moment. We're currently under a two-week quarantine where they are using the PRC test, which has been recalled.</br></br>

UCI: Wow.</br></br>

Caller: So, when the nurse appeared shoving a swab up your nose, and you're like, "Oh, okay, is this the rapid test or the three-day test?" "We're not sure."</br></br>

"Oh, is this the PRC test?" "Oh, yes, it is." "Well, hasn't that been recalled?" "No." Okay, you don't know what you're talking about.</br></br>

UCI: Wow. So the information is not even getting to the staff. Forget the staff think that they're doing the right thing. Sometimes the information doesn't even get to the staff.</br></br>

Caller: Right. It would be nice to have the information, so we at least know where we stand. But they don't provide it. The typical answer is, from staff, because I typically would -- will grill, every time they gave me a COVID test, I would be like, "Okay, is this the rapid test? Is this the long-term test? Are you guys going to be able to sequence the test if I do test positive to find out what variant I have?"</br></br>

Because I'm fully aware that if I have a common cold, I can come up positive with the COVID test, because you guys aren't sequencing the results. Anyone can manipulate a statistic. I'm fully aware of this.</br></br>

So, when I hear the news, and they say, "Oh well, 53 percent of people have the Delta variant." I'm like, "Okay, but you tested 10 people, and 5 people and one maybe gives you 53 percent." I'm not stupid.</br></br>

So, when I'm asking these types of questions to CDCR staff, the nurses, they may be subcontractors, I'm not sure, so I can't really say that with 100 percent confidence, but they don't know. They have no answers.
