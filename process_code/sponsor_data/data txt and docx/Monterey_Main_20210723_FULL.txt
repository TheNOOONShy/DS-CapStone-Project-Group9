This story was told by a person incarcerated at Monterey County Correctional Facility.</br></br> 

UCI: Now, how has the COVID situation been at your facility?</br></br> 

Caller: It doesn't really seem to affect people that much, other than no in-person visits. People get shots, people get tested. You know, I mean it affects your visiting rights, so it's a little more lonely.</br></br> 

UCI: I see. So, you said that the vaccination situation has been pretty okay, because people are getting the shots? Do you have anything else to say about that?</br></br> 

Caller: I mean you can't have in-person visits, which you could have before. So there's that, that affects people and it makes it harder. I'd like to see my girlfriends and have them come and visit me. Because I was living in Santa Barbara, in fact, Santa Barbara State University, where I was involved with a project, and I have two girlfriends there.</br></br> 

UCI: Got you. Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt you. Keep going.</br></br> 

Caller: So, you know, you go, and mainly you're around a bunch of men, where I was used to being with both of them. And I care deeply about them. So, no physical contact. Even if they could come, you're through a glass window, so that's hard.</br></br> 

UCI: I see. So, you said that you had two girlfriends and they're not able to visit you. How has that affected them? How has COVID affected them not being able to ... Like, how has COVID affected their mental state, not being able to visit you? Like how has the COVID situation at your facility affected your loved ones?</br></br> 

Caller: They miss me. I'm their main man. And the three of us, we do a lot of things together. We make love together. And we will go to the beach and do all kinds of things. And now it's very hard on them.</br></br> 

UCI: I see. Now, what has there been - no, keep talking, keep going, keep going.</br></br> 

Caller: They write [unintelligible]. No physical contact.</br></br> 

UCI: I see. So I take it the reduced visitation has been pretty hard on you. Not just you, but also your family.</br></br> 

Caller: Yes, of course. [unintelligible] my two girlfriends.</br></br> 

UCI: Do you have a -</br></br>  

Caller: Luckily, they have each other. You know, bisexually, so they have each other then. I would love to [unintelligible] them and we've been together for five years. They [unintelligible] and a lot of it is just being in jail is difficult.</br></br> 

UCI: I see.</br></br> 

Caller: COVID doesn't help.</br></br> 

UCI: Yeah. I can tell this has been extremely hard on you. But not just you, but also your family. How have you been coping with this?</br></br> 

Caller: How have I been coping with it?</br></br>   

UCI: Yeah.</br></br> 

Caller: I write a lot of letter to them. I get letter from them and my friends and think about them. And what it's going to be like when I get out. And how we'll go on a trip, and how we're going to make love with each other, and all the wonderful things you do together. They're really sexy, beautiful women. One's 45 and one's 32. And I'm 55. So, it's a wonderful relationship. It's a serious relationship.</br></br>   

UCI: That's great. You said that's been hard on you. I mean had on them. This hotline is also available to like family members, so if they want to share their experience about how having a loved one in a facility during COVID-19 has affected them, this hotline is also available to them. So, you said you also write letters to them, so you could include this number and tell them that this is open to them, too, if you'd like.</br></br>   

Caller: I didn't know that.</br></br>   

UCI: Yeah, this is -</br></br> 

Caller: Do you go to UC Irvine?</br></br>

UCI: Yes, I do.</br></br>

Caller: What do you study there?</br></br>

UCI: I'm studying criminology.</br></br>

Caller: That seems to be a - is that a common thing for people that volunteer for this?</br></br>

UCI: Yeah. Most of the people that I know that are in this study are all criminology majors, or criminology professors, or are past criminology majors.</br></br>

Caller: Is law enforcement a class you would take? Or probation? Or what would be?</br></br>

UCI: For myself, I want to maybe go to law school after I graduate.</br></br>

Caller: Okay. That's good. So, you might be a criminal defense attorney.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah. I have a few more questions to ask you, if that's okay.</br></br>

Caller: Sure. Yeah, of course.</br></br>

UCI: All right. I said, this hotline is available to them. If you give them the number, we have a whole set of questions to ask them how they've been dealing with this process. But you said that the main thing that you had to talk about is the limited visitation. How would you have made the situation better at your facility, like overall?</br></br>

Caller: Well, the one thing is I haven't been convicted of anything. So, I think there ought to be a separate set of rules for people that are convicted versus haven't been convicted. But I mean if you could have more in-person visitation. And then if you could have, I know it's difficult, visitation where you can have physical contact. Or you could make love with your loved ones, even spend a night or something, that would be a good thing, and make people more positive and more relaxed.</br></br>

UCI: I see. Is there anything else that you would like to share about your experience in the facility during COVID-19?</br></br>

Caller: I got a question. There's no classes in person yet? What's going on at UC Irvine?</br></br>

UCI: No, not yet. During the fall, we're hopeful that we're going to classes. Most likely we are. So, it's looking like it's on the upside that we're going to have classes in person.</br></br>

Caller: That's a great area. I've spent a lot of time around Newport Beach and going down, you have that Bayfront Park. And I know Morton Irvine Smith, who's Joan Irvine Smith's son that gave all the land to UC Irvine for the university.</br></br>

UCI: Oh, I didn't know that.</br></br>

Caller: All that land. Yeah. Morton Irvine Smith. He's like the black sheep of the family, but he's a good guy.</br></br>

UCI: Oh, thanks for sharing that.</br></br>

Caller: There's a company, it's called SkyH2O you can look up that the Water School is involved with that my friend started. So I spent a lot of time around Irvine and the campus. And I've been out at the Balboa Bay Resort and Gulfstream and that whole area. It's fantastic. You're lucky to university there.</br></br>

UCI: Thank you. I worked very hard to get here. I was originally a transfer student, so I had my eyes set on UCI, and I'm glad I'm here, and I'm glad I'm able to have this conversation regarding your experience with COVID-19.</br></br>

Caller: I appreciate the efforts of all the students and professor. Is it Tunney or Turney?</br></br>

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: Have you met - is that one of your professors?</br></br>

UCI: Who? Sorry.</br></br>

Caller: The professor that's in charge of this PrisonPandemic project.</br></br>

UCI: I do not know which one you are referring to. There are two. One of them that I've been working closely with, she's great. But I know the one that's - oh, the name that's on the letter? No, I have never personally met her.</br></br>

Caller: Kristin Turney.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, I've never personally met her. But she's like the bigwig.</br></br>

Caller: Oh, yeah, so she's like a chair professor of something.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: You never met her, huh?</br></br>
 
UCI: I've never met her personally, no.</br></br>

Caller: All right. Well, thank you for your help and your time.</br></br>

UCI: Thank you for telling me all about your experience with COVID-19. So yeah, this hotline is available to your family member, your two girlfriends that you said. So, if you want to give them this number, we have a list of questions to ask them. So, yes.</br></br>

Caller: Monday through Friday night.</br></br>

UCI: Monday through Friday, five to nine, yes.</br></br>

Caller: Okay, all right. I'll tell them that.</br></br>

UCI: All right. Thank you very much.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, bye-bye.</br></br>

UCI: All right, bye-bye.
