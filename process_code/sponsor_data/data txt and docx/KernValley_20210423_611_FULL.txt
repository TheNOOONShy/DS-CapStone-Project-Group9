This story was told by a person incarcerated at Kern Valley State Prison.</br></br>


UCI: What has the COVID situation been like at your facility?</br></br>


Caller: It has been unpleasant to say the least. It’s been a lot more them controlling us and telling us what to do and not being able to see how our loved ones are doing because of phone calls. No visitation, it’s just been very rough. I mean, no one ever thinks that there’d be a pandemic and now that it’s actually happening to us and it’s like being locked up twice. It’s awful. It’s bad.</br></br>


UCI: How has the COVID situation at your facility affected your loved ones?</br></br>

Caller: What was that, like how it affects my loved ones?</br></br>


UCI: Yeah like well it could be either them or like visitation. Anything that's changed.</br></br>


Caller: Yeah I mean, as far as that goes, I’m an inmate with few resources so I haven’t seen my family since 2019 because of COVID. Unfortunately my father caught COVID and he almost died. He caught COVID and because of COVID he almost like, he caught pneumonia at the same time and that almost killed him. I thought I was never going to get to see my father again due to COVID and the way things went down here.</br></br>


We’re not allowed to have visitation and you know they lock us down because an inmate tests positive for COVID so we’re not able to use the phone and the mail is slow. So I haven’t seen my family since 2019 and it’s affected us really really bad. I even was in a relationship with somebody and because of COVID I’m no longer in a relationship because the distance between us broke us apart and now it’s just a tragedy that happened to me, you know?</br></br>


UCI: How have you been coping with everything?</br></br>


Caller: I mean it’s difficult, I personally spent almost 20 years incarcerated so you just have to cope, you have no other choice. You have to deal with it within yourself. You bottle up your emotions and just do what you have to. There is no really anybody else you can share your emotions with. Everybody’s going through the same thing and doing that in here isn’t looked upon too well, you know? So it’s just you struggle with it. You don’t know what to do, what to say, how to help your loved ones because you're trapped.</br></br>


And to recieve help as well cause’ unfortunately my environment being in a maximum security prison is just like, they treat you like crap. You’re just an inmate, you’re just a number, you know? So, coping with it lately is hard and I guess as far as the reason I’m feeling now is because venting or just expressing what I’m feeling now has kind of helped. My story can help somebody else to deal with their tough time. Man that would be a good thing I can do.</br></br>


UCI: What do you think would have made your situation at your facility better?</br></br>


Caller: Definitely them considering more visitation, a way to visit with our family members, ways to contact our family members, and many really not making it a California wide thing. Chino state prison has three positive inmates but we have none here so why should their status affect our status? Our status at this prison right now is zero COVID, as far as my yard that I’m on there’s zero COVID positives. There’s nothing yet we still have to suffer the consequences of the other yards and the things that they go through.</br></br>


They need to help us talk to our families more. Whenever we are able to call home it’s every two, three months. Lately it’s been okay but by the time we call home it’s like, “Hey, what’s his name did or what’s his name died.” And it’s like what, what’s going on just because we don’t have opportunities to call our loved ones and stuff like that. So, they need to help us reach and be with our loved ones a lot faster that the way they’re doing it now.</br></br>


UCI: How has the vaccination situation been like at your facility?</br></br>


Caller: So far so good. I mean I’ve personally been vaccinated already. I got the two shots they gave me the moderna shot and I got both of them. A lot of inmates are refusing just because they don’t trust the system or the way things go. I got it, it’s pretty much been rolling, they’re doing it. They’re trying to get everyone vaccinated so we can stop this disease, this virus.</br></br>


UCI: Is there anything else you want people to know about your experience?</br></br>


Caller: Well as far as my experience with COVID I mean it’s been horrible. At the beginning, I had a lot more negative things going on in my life other than COVID and then COVID came and it was just like an extra weight on my shoulders. I was in the hole for disciplinary reasons, then COVID came, then my father caught COVID, and he almost died from COVID. He’s damn near paralyzed now where he can’t even walk.</br></br>


I have a son I don’t know nothing about .I don’t know if his family got COVID. I don’t know what’s going on, i have family members in other states and countries. COVID has been horrible, it's been bad. I lost my wife because of COVID. It’s just been really bad and it’s still going on. Within myself it’s just not getting better so my experience with COVID has just been horrible. It’s something that I never want to experience ever again. I’ve lost a lot due to COVID.</br></br>


UCI: How do you think the COVID situation has affected your loved ones as well and just everything overall due to reduced visitation and everything?</br></br>


Caller: I know it’s affected my father a lot of great deals because he’s a business owner and because of COVID he wasn’t able to attend his business and emotionally the relationships between the people I love, as I repeat, I wasn’t able to see my wife because there’s no visits allowed and there’s no way to have that affection with one another. So emotionally it was too hard for her to deal with not being able to see me physically, not being able to come see me and the distance tore us apart. We ended up divorcing and now I had a wife, someone who I really loved and cherished, someone who I changed a lot of negative thinking and negative ways in prison because of her and I wanted to show her that men here can rehabilitate and change and be different. Because of COVID and the distance that it caused, it broke us apart.</br></br>


The communication that I had with my mother and father was low. When I come from a good family, I guess you can say I’m a stereotyped Latino family. It’s broken us apart. It’s been rough, we’re not able to talk as much as we want. Even now, just to get on this phone I had to start getting out of my door to get the phone call. It’s like the cops here are doing nothing, just sleeping. It’s like I have to start yelling out of my door like I’m crazy just to get this phone call.</br></br>


And this thing you guys sent in the main it wasn’t for me it was for my cellmate and he didn’t want to call and share his thoughts but I kind of wanted to call and share my story and see what else and opportunities I can get from your guys’ project. You know what I’m saying?</br></br>


UCI: You’re always more than welcome to write in if it’s easier than calling in. I don’t know if you have that information.</br></br>


Caller: I have the info that was sent by the name of PrisonPandemic.</br></br>


UCI: Okay and that should have the P.O. box information in it.</br></br>


Caller: It has P.O. box California.</br></br>


UCI: Yes</br></br>


Caller: How can this service help me as far as me helping other inmates or helping. What are your guys’ main goal from this project?</br></br>


UCI: The main goal is to bring awareness because there’s no one else that is participating in any kind of program like this. This is the only way that the word is going to get the word out. And we’re also here for family members because family members can also call in or anyone that’s incarcerated from jails or prisons. And then everything is, without including any names or information, everything is posted online. So that’s the only way to really get the word out. And you know, you guys can call anytime during the week whenever you guys’ are allowed your phone calls. You can always write in and it’s always nice to always have someone that you can call. And you can also send drawings in as well.</br></br>


Caller: Oh okay. Wow.</br></br>


UCI: So if someone doesn’t want to call in.</br></br>


Caller: Would I be able to talk to the same person every time or will I keep sharing my personal information with different people? Or…</br></br>


UCI: Unfortunately, not.</br></br>


Caller: Okay, okay.</br></br>


UCI: You’re always willing to write in. It’s always probably going to be someone different. I mean, but you know you’re getting your story out there and then eventually everyone’s going to see it.</br></br>


Caller: If I would want cause’, like I said I’ve been incarcerated almost twenty years of my life since juvenile and I have done experienced a lot, a lot of stuff in prison. It’s like if I would want my story to be told and not be anonymous, is that something that is possible or are you guys’ strictly trying to keep people anonymous?</br></br>


UCI: Unfortunately, we have to make it anonymous. That’s the only way we can do it, yeah. So like the only thing that would be disclosed is like the facility but your name and things like that, unfortunately, we can’t disclose.</br></br>


Caller: Okay I understand. Ok well I can write in my stories, I wouldn’t mind sharing my stories and personal life stories and you guys need it to be anonymous. Whatever I can help, I don’t know what other ways I can help or if you have any other questions but I’d love to help. Like I said I’m an inmate who’s tryna rehabilitate myself and I only have a couple years left and I’d be back out there.</br></br>


But unfortunately due to stuff like COVID it’s like it does things to our minds in here and it’s harder to cope or not have someone to talk to or share with who has some type of professional training as far as guiding me and telling me it’s okay to feel this way because of what’s going on, you know what I’m saying?</br></br>


UCI: Can I give you the National Suicide Prevention Hotline just in case you ever wanna call?</br></br>


Caller: Yeah I don't have a, let me grab a pen real quick. Give me one one second. Hello?</br></br>


UCI: Yes.</br></br>


Caller: Okay so what did you say that this number was going to be to?</br></br>


UCI: Its National Suicide Prevention Hotline if you or anyone else feels like you need to talk to someone.</br></br>


Caller: Yeah okay what's the number?</br></br>


UCI: 800-273-8255</br></br>


Caller: Well, I think I believe you said your name was Stephanie.</br></br>


UCI: Yes.</br></br>


Caller: I’m out of time.</br></br>


UCI: Thank you very much.</br></br>


Caller: Yeah no problem. I will be writing you my story and I guess whoever answers it answers it and I hope that I'll be able to help somebody and get some help in the process.</br></br>


UCI: Please consider telling anyone to write in, call in, whatever makes them feel more comfortable.</br></br>


Caller: Okay thank you. You guys be careful out there. God bless and have a good afternoon.</br></br>


UCI: Thank you.
