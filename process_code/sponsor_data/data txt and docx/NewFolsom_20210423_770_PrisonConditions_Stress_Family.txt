This letter was written by a person incarcerated at New Folsom.</br></br>Well here's how it is behind these walls. We must all wear a mask, and we couldn’t have visits from our family, and they just started to give us our COVID shots which I’m happy to get that, and it’s really been hard on all of us. They had a lot of guys who tested positive for COVID and I don’t know what they did to them.</br></br>

But come on now, these officers had to bring that on to us. We never got to get out!! These officers, I mean the higher up ones, have no regard or respect for us. They treat us like animals here. I find myself trying real hard not to commit suicide. Yes, it’s been really hard on us, yes some guys did take their life, and as for me I’ve locked up since 1981.</br></br>

My case, under SB. 261, I was under age, but the CDCR does not recognize that, so they do everything they can to keep a person like me locked up. I’m being disrespected and discriminated, due to I am a person, who has tried everything possible to be a good person, and stay out of trouble. I was a gang member, but I gave that all up, I’m just all by myself.</br></br>

I gave my life to our wonderful God who has changed my life around and I thank him everyday for that, but all I do is show everyone respect. I don’t care who you are, but as far as my gang, they are the most hated hang in the prison. Bulldogs they have war with everyone, so everywhere I go I must explain myself.</br></br>

Like right now, we are still under strict movement due to COVID and hopefully we will get our visits where we can see our loved ones!! For more than one hour, yes that is I was told and they refused to let my uncle in to see me. He’s real old. I got him and my sister in my life and I’m mentally ill.</br></br>

I have real bad mental problems, I hear voices, see things other people don’t see, that's what I’m told. They sent me to state hospital a few times where I was getting better treatment. It really did seem like I was getting better. But then it all stopped the prison wanted me back in a cell so they could mistreat me and do as they wanted.
