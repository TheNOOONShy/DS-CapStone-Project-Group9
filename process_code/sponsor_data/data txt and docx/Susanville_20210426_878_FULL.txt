This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Susanville.</br></br>
A life without love is like a tree without fruit, if you can not lave anybody today at least try not to hurt anyone – which was not the case here! Back in June, around the fourth of that month in 2020, this institution knowingly allowed other inmates to be transferred here and on top of that because as we all know the more inmates received in a prison institution the more funding that prison institution receives.</br></br>
 So, with that being just one of the many factors the institution of CCC (aka the Susanville) only cared about prosperity of the institution, its correctional officers, free staff, and clearly the welfare of use (aka the inmates) did not matter to them. Worse began to turn worse and one of their very own passed away and then everything became serious but then it was already too late. Both yards were openly infected with the COVID-19 virus.</br></br>
For months I was clearly negative for the virus but due to them moving us around, allowing those they knew for a fact to be COVID-19 positive to be around us and then mixing negative and positive together, I too was infected and became positive for COVID-19. I was scared, in shock, and going crazy out of my mind in my own type of way.</br></br>
I’ve seen individuals (aka inmates) fall out and the paramedics come get them – for a time the staff would try to say it was from the heat (which the weather wasn't hot at the time) or the person was not drinking enough fluids. But we all know you can not hide the truth for long and people were falling out due to the COVID-19 virus and being infected. The higher ups (aka the brass and the wardens are all alike) they did not care and tried their hardest to just sweep the situation(s) under the rug.</br></br>
Such foolishness mixed with craziness without care of their part. From what I've hearing both wardens are in hot water! On April 8, 2021 I finally get a chance to take the Johnson & Johnson shot so I’ve now been vaccinated. But to think about what more could have  done to really prevent the outbreak of COVID-19 here if this institution was not money hungry and allowed to continuously cover whatever there is of importance here. We are so very well out of the way here and nobody really takes the time to deal with issues here.</br></br>
But sincerely I thank you with all my heart and soul for you reaching out to me, you all are blessings within a blessing. Do continue to do as you are doing upon your wonderful platform. I’ve told others to write and reveal their hardships and stories to you so expect (hopefully) more letters to come but then again some of these individuals fear retaliation that’s openly done here. I have only 67 days to go before I parole so I’m ready to put this system and institution on blast so they and others can truly be held accountable for their careless actions and shortcomings. We are still humans, and they do some treacherous things here.</br></br>
The way the COVID-19 situation started is just part of the tip of the iceberg. You all (aka the PrisonPandemic project) are highly appreciated and again thank you so very much for allowing me to be a part of something of greatness.</br></br> 

Thank you.
