This story was told by a person incarcerated at El Dorado County Jail.</br></br>

UCI: You were talking about how the suicide rate has gone up.</br></br>

Caller: Oh, yeah. So since this younger staff has taken over, namely they've imposed a new policy of lock — just locking everybody down all — that way they don't have to do their job as far as classifying inmates as far as, like, you know, separating them.</br></br> 

UCI: Mhm.</br></br>

Caller: They could just put everybody in isolation. So everybody in the Placerville jail is in isolation, solitary confinement. Whether they're good or not, whether they're — whether they're, you know, in protective custody or general population, everybody is in solitary confinement.</br></br> 

Everyone's locked down 24 hours a day, and it's, as you can imagine, detrimental to, you know, their mental health. You got people who are hanging themselves in their cells.</br></br>

UCI: Mhm.</br></br>

Caller: It's never reported; you know? And — and they're infecting everybody with COVID, too, at the same time. The staff is not vaccinated.</br></br>

They keep bringing in new people off the street. They — the staff come and go on a daily basis. And there's no oversight. There's no — El Dorado County has no federal oversight, nobody from the state coming in and checking on them; you know?</br></br>

They don't — they don't anticipate, you know, groups like, you know, like you coming in and checking up on us. There's nobody — until I got, you know, your letter, I didn't know who to reach out to. In fact, I wrote a letter to the editor of the local paper, and they twisted it around, make it sound like that I was just complaining.
