This story was told by a person incarcerated at Corcoran.</br></br>

UCI: Now, my biggest issue I have is visiting, and this is for a lot of us. This, this covers a lot of our issues with regards to having our loved ones come visit us.</br></br> 

You know, now when they come visit us, they either have to have (a) their vaccination card or (b) a negative COVID test within the last 72 hours, I believe. And, which is three days, yeah.</br></br>

And what this - and right now when they come and visit us, and I’m about to get a visit tomorrow from my wife. When she comes in, she has to sit on the other side of the table and we’re only allowed a hug.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>

Caller: And, normally, like if it's for a regular family member then, you know, obviously a kiss on the mouth is not that - or some people, you know, family members and mothers will give them a kiss on the cheek, but we’re not allowed to kiss right now. Which, it really makes no sense cause we’re sitting right across from each other and, you know, we’re all in the same room and more importantly, they’re coming in with - especially if they’re coming in with a negative COVID test.</br></br>

UCI: Right.</br></br>

Caller: And all of us, we get test - we get tested on a normal basis ourselves so if we’re both meeting in a visiting room with negative COVID tests or vaccinated, then why is our interaction with each other under scrutiny?</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>

Caller: You know what I mean?</br></br>

UCI: Yes. 100 percent.</br></br>

Caller: It - it's yeah, and it’s unnecessary. It’s unnecessary. Now when I see my wife tomorrow, we have to - our interaction is under scrutiny if there’s any contact.</br></br> 

And if I do happen to give her a kiss, my visit may be subject to termination. They may tell me, “Hey, you know what? You’re breaking the COVID policy.”</br></br>

“You guys gave each other a kiss so she has to leave.” She drove four hours to get here. “Well, she has to leave.”</br></br>

UCI: Wow.</br></br>

Caller: “You gotta go back to the prison yard.”</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah. And then I could get a write up. I could get disciplinary action against me when, in reality, what actually - what really did I do wrong? Besides showing affection to my loved one?
