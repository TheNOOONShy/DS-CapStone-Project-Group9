But what had everybody confused is that the officers who were here when the virus first hit wasn’t quarantined at all. They continued to come to work. As the days and weeks went by, they continued to COVID test us with that painful, long q-tip up our noses. They continue to cell feed us with those uncovered paper plates that were exposed to the cold air.</br></br> 

Which felt like we were in solitary confinement being punished for a deadly virus that was brought into this institution from the public by prison employees.</br></br>

Anyway, things really turned for the worst when the medical staff started testing us with the ew rapid COVID testing kits. All of a sudden hundreds and hundreds of inmates started testing positive for the virus in the building where those officers that came back from San Quentin Prison worked. After that the virus was in every building, so the institution brought the tents on the yard and started housing all of the positive inmates in them for 14 days quarantine.</br></br> 

Now every three days after we took the test we had to listen to see if our names were going to be called to roll up some of our property. Which meant that we were being moved outside to the tents because the tests came back positive.</br></br>

In the meantime, a lot of us didn’t want to take the new test because we felt like something wasn’t right with it but was told that it was mandatory that we had to take it. Many of us felt like we were being treated like we were lab rats being experimented on. We even stopped accepting the food that was being brought to us by the officers in case of catching the virus.</br></br> 

Anyway, as of today April 2021, I’ve been COVID tested 33 times and I’ve taken both vaccination shots and they are still forcing us to take a COVID test which doesn't make any sense.
