This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Soledad.</br></br>

What has it been like to have reduced visitation from family and loved ones? Well first of all some prisoners don't have anyone at all so we as prisoners ask others to go check on who they can to see if they're okay or need anything. And if that need could be met the men inside their own housing unit do their best to help each other. As for us that do have someone, this has had so many different effects.</br></br> 

For myself, I've become somewhat immune to the separation from lengthy lockdowns due to riots and violence.There's times that emotional constriction takes place and because of where I live I've learned to turn it off and on as needed which no one should be doing because this affects our decision making process.</br></br>

By purposely blocking things out, I know my family misses me and I miss them too. I just have to accept the things I cannot change and stay courageous in what I can, again I'm only in control of myself. I bring it back to basics and write letters expressing unconditional love rather they write back or not, they're doing exactly what they need to be doing and that is simply living their lives.</br></br> 

When I do get a letter it turns out my patience paid off and I move forward, not that I was on hold, I'm living day by day also.</br></br>

Recently the prison implemented video visits for all prisoners yet it's failed to include all prisoners. The prison rewrote the rules and are only allowing prisoners who have tested positive to partake in this exclusive event. My video visits keeps getting cancelled as well as many others within my housing unit. Again our ideas are not important but they could bring the laptop to my building.</br></br> 

As I continue to observe the failures and lack of communication it looks like the elephant might be pregnant and they still look the other way. Iâ€™d love to see my family but the prison decides that for me.
