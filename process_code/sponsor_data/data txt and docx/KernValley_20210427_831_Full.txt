Dear PrisonPandemic;</br></br>

Greetings to you and everyone in your class. I hope that this letter finds you in the best of health, both body and mind. I'm really an avid writer yet I'm stuck on what to write to you. I'm really not the type to write people I don't know.</br></br> 

I've never been the pen pal type, but socially I am an extrovert.</br></br>

Honestly, when I saw your letter on my desk, I thought it was some sort of practical joke from my younger sisters. The handwriting is similar to the way Asians print English don't ask me to explain.</br></br>

One of my sisters graduated from UCI she's an official aardvark or anteater and my other sibling lives in Irvine, so it was suspect. I hadn't realized until I saw your letter that it's been quite awhile since I'd spoke or written to them. Funny how fate makes us do things or give us hints to do things like write my sisters.</br></br>

I don't know what to write to you about you can always watch "Lockdown" on the National Geographic channel it's all fake and lies. Prison is generally a house of pain and misery. Ironically you're surrounded by people 24/7 yet you're the loneliest person in the world.</br></br>

Please forgive my grammatical, spelling, and language errors. Since all the people I write now are people I'm familiar with, my writing has grown very liberal with swearing and grammar has been thrown to the birds. Even my lawyers are used to my transcript-like style of writing.</br></br>

First and foremost I'd like to say thank you for writing a total stranger and giving some positive hope a currency very short in my current environment. I hope that COVID-19 hasn't negatively impacted your life in any way. Basically I hope that you and yours are safe.</br></br>

Honestly I'm safer in here from COVID-19 than the average citizen outside these walls. If the staff hadn't brought the virus in from outside we'd all have been virus-free. I've been vaccinated already although I was hesitant to get it, 'cause all the doomsday zombie movies always begin with some miraculous medicine or medical procedure. I'm not a zombie yet so it must be okay!</br></br>

But in this enclosed environment you can imagine how quickly it spread once it was in the walls. I never caught it and multiple tests were negative, what made it miraculous was my cellmate had it but even though we're locked up together in a 8'x12' cell he never passed it on. So, it is possible not to get it, so please follow mask and hygiene protocols.</br></br>

I'm still trying to figure out what to write am I some kind of psychological experiment? Well as you know I'm a long term tenant at hotel California. I've been here since 2008 for murder. I don't need legal aid, that's what I pay blood-sucking lawyers for who happen to be my friends as well when not "lawyer-ing".</br></br>

Let's see, I grew up in southern Orange County. I live in Huntington Beach, California when I'm not vacationing in Delano, California! My sisters still live in OC, one is a doctor in Irvine and the other sibling is a firewoman at Fullerton Fire Department. So I'm definitely the black sheep of the family.</br></br>

I am the anti-everything of what a prison convict's background should be. I graduated in business. At this time in my life I have no regrets to the crime I committed. Maybe years from now I'll have remorse but I follow the Latin phrase "Res, non verba" (Action, not words).</br></br>

I'm a very blunt and straight forward person and abhor lies and liars. Ironically the most righteous type of person in the environment I'm currently in. Honest and respectful people are the most respected type of convict on the yard. That old adage "Honor amongst thieves!" is a golden rule in here.</br></br>

For a place filled with killers and criminals, lying and stealing is not tolerated. Kinda sick huh? We "sheltered in cell" since March and as I mentioned earlier we worried more about people outside than of ourselves in here. We as convicts are used to being treated like shit, like caged animals.</br></br>

You wrote about positive prison reforms, to be totally blunt with you that's the funniest shit I've ever heard. There's no such thing as "prison reforms". We're treated like shit and the justice system in California is a joke.</br></br>

I was found guilty so I deserve my punishment. But as a legal clerk in the prison library I've seen prisoners that weren't guilty or didn't deserve the sentence imposed by the courts. I am one of the biggest critics of the CDCR, there is so much corruption and cover-up in here you'd think we were in prison in a third world country. So when the pandemic hit do you think they did anything positive for us that we didn't fight for?</br></br>

The company that runs our phone system here would give us two days a month with free phone calls. And on those days they'd lock us down denying us access to the phones with some false alleged reason. You'd think our mail would be more prompt and efficient but it got worse than it's usual ineffectiveness.</br></br>

I've logged every bit of incoming and outgoing mail since 2017 because I must routinely write them a grievance once a year so they'll process our mail properly. The mail is my most common and important way of correspondence with my family and friends. So it is of the most utmost important, more than the horrible inedible food or the corruption of the staff.</br></br>

Of course our visits were reduced but unless you're a selfish son of a bitch, why would you want your loved ones exposed to possible infection? So I think our reduced visiting was absolutely correct protocol. But they should have improved our access to phone calls and more efficiently process our mail it is common sense but they (CDCR) didn't come through either.</br></br>

Since supplies were hard to deliver, all our canteens was on a limit which is bad when we go to store once a month. You'd think that our 30 lb. care packages our families order for us would come quicker due to our shortened store list, but even though the COs have less to do since we're shelter in our cells it takes just as long or at times longer.</br></br>

You would never know this if you've never done time or know someone here. My sisters didn't believe at first but they also know that their eldest brother doesn't complain privately. I've been through worse.</br></br>

We stay in our cells normally but with the pandemic protocols we're confined to our cells 21 hours a day. With an infection virus like COVID-19 and pandemic you'd think they'd give us disinfectant but they give us watered down Windex or a degreaser. I must buy disinfectant from the inmate janitors to clean my cell.</br></br>

If I know you as a friend I'd tell you that your whole project is utterly naive if you think you can help reform this prison system. We're treated like cattle and not human. I've seen this place change like stage scenery in a play when an outside entity comes to audit or come see about a complain.</br></br>

CDCR demands at lease 24 hours advance notice (due to security). In that time we're locked down while everything is fixed! We've gotten most of out reforms through hunger strikes and media exposure. Funny how I wrote earlier I had nothing to write about!</br></br>

I apologize for ranting and raving in my first letter to you. I hope I can find some positive feedback to my negative ravings. I can actually be quite charming when not speaking about CDCR!</br></br>

We are the greatest nation in the world, with the only fair system of justice besides one on one combat J/K, yet our courts are so punitive and our corrections medieval and archaic. I hope to hear your thoughts.</br></br> 

Sincerely.</br></br>

Hello again it is Sunday and our outgoing mail day starts today for the week. I'm writing to you this second letter because as I saw the three letters on my desk that I was mailing, one to my younger sister, the second to a friend, and the third to you. I decided to do something I rarely do I reread my letter and I let my cellmate read it.</br></br>

I asked him if it is seemed a bit hostile. He told me that I bluntly answered the questions about the frustrations of being incarcerated during COVID. I'd answered with my usual sarcastic and cynical charm.</br></br>

He pointed out that I'd tried to explain so much within two pieces of paper, that is not possible. So, I decided to write you another letter introduce myself and hopefully you'll reply the same. I must tell you that your letter really caught me off guard.</br></br>

It arrived after so many coincidences. I had just told my cellmate about how long it'd been since I wrote my younger sister who went to your school, and my friend had urged me on my last phone call to write a story of my life.</br></br>

A subject that continually comes up between friends, family, lawyers and myself. But due to self-incrimination or of others, I continually refuse this idea. So you can imagine how coincidental your letter was. Especially since I'm Asian and we tend to be very superstitious. But let me write to you more politely and personally and hopefully we'll both learn something.</br></br>

I was born in Los Angeles, California but grew up in south Orange County. I went to jr. high in Mission Viejo and [redacted] High until I moved to Huntington Beach where I graduated from [redacted] High. Both my sisters went to [redacted] High until one decided to attend [redacted] and the other [redacted].</br></br>

Each of us is exactly seven years apart in age. My older younger sibling is a doctor of medicine and the youngest a fireman or fire person to be politically correct. I'm sure both have dealt with the pandemic hands on compared to me.</br></br>

I went to prison in 1995 for double homicide. In 2004 the appeals court deemed it justifiable homicide and I went home. I opened up a restaurant, a premium denim line, bought 40 percent shares in a post-production and design company. I bought a nightclub in Korea town and was in the works to buy a Hollywood nightclub as well.</br></br>

But of all my post-release achievements, finding a wonderful wife who didn't know of me or my past and marrying her was my most wonderful achievement. In 2008 I was arrested for murder coincidentally by the same detectives for my prior case, a case the Supreme Court felt I was unfairly charged for.</br></br>

I've been incarcerated for 13 years and my lawyers assure me I'll be home one day. I don't feel so bad because I've done more in my life than many people dream about. I've been all over the world especially Asia, met many different people, both good, bad, and super-bad.</br></br>

I can honestly say I've been on first name basis with over a dozen celebrities good and bad! I see others in here, especially the young ones who've done nothing with their lives so I derive some comfort from my past. The pandemic hasn't affected my family out there and I pray they don't.</br></br>

Prison is hell on Earth and the pandemic just made it legal for the CDCR to treat us even crappier. So, what is the reason for all this? Are you a psych major? Humanities? Do you know anyone in prison? Have you ever been to jail?</br></br>

I wouldn't wish prison on my worst enemies and I have a lot. I'm well educated and very well read so you can imagine how much mental and academic stimulation I get in this environment. Maybe it's good my name was chosen, why was it chosen? Your turn to write!</br></br> 

Sincerely.
