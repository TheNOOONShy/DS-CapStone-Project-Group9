UCI: How's the COVID situation been like at your facility?</br></br>

Caller: Well, it's pretty hectic right now, you know. There's some of us that are on lockdown, you know, 24/7. You know, they're doing, like, quarantine, some sections. Thankfully, my section is not on quarantine right now because, thankfully, nobody in my section has got sick. But it's been pretty hectic, you know.</br></br> 

They stopped all visitations for everybody. You know, and it sucks big time because I'm used to seeing my family, getting my two visits a week every week and stuff like that. And it pretty sucks.</br></br>

And then, they give laundry only, like, two days a week. So, that gets pretty hard as well, you know. You've got to wash your own clothes in your sink and stuff like that with soap and stuff like that. And, you know, there's some people that are downstairs, you know.</br></br> 

They don't get to go out, and they don't get to talk to their families at all or use their phone. And right now I'm calling off the tablet, because I have a tablet and stuff like that. And the way I cope with COVID, I'm able to use the tablets, watch movies, listen to music, and you know, talk to my loved ones, thankfully.</br></br>

And some people that just don't have tablets, you know, they're stuck in their cell. And, you know, they think all day - think about all the stuff that they may be going through. So, yeah, it gets pretty tough, you know. Some people, you know, just cope with it differently than others.
