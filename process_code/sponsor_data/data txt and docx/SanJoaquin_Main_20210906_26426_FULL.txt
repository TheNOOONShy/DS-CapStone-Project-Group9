<em>This story was told by a person incarcerated at San Joaquin County Jail.</br></br></em>

Caller: I have a story to read for you guys. I was referring to it as Immaculate Concept for the Power of Good. But once I looked back to rewrite it onto paper from off the tablet I had and I had [stuff on] emails, I realized that the title's actually The Immaculate Concept of the Power of the Positive, which kind of has a better ring to it, I think. But before I do read that one, I'd like to read you this quick one I had wrote this morning to give you just one hot off the presses to give you direct insight to what it's like here in this jail dealing with this COVID situation and whatnot.</br></br>

UCI: Okay.</br></br>

Caller: It's about an incident that happened earlier in the day. So, I titled this one, I almost wrote this one as if like a diary log. It's a three-page one.</br></br> 

It'll go quick. I titled it Today. So, Today is the title. And here we go.</br></br>

Well, I have to start this passage of what I've named Today by first telling you about something that feels like it happened yesterday. It was at 4:00 am when breakfast was being served. It was oatmeal and soy sausage, my favorite. Yum.</br></br> 

I ate mine quickly and was hungry for more as they had not fed us breakfast for almost a month now, since the COVID lockdown started. They instead fed us peanut butter and jelly sandwiches all day. And with this COVID lockdown, they also have to keep us stuck in our cells 24 hours a day, although lately some COs can be slightly lenient towards what we can and can't do outside of our cells due to the fact that we've now all tested negative for COVID twice.</br></br> 

But we need to clear a third test before they'll lift this lockdown procedure.</br></br>

So, with that, I exited my cell, having already eaten my first tray of food, and approached the top of the staircase to politely ask the CO on duty if I may be allowed to go downstairs into the corridor and ask the kitchen workers for another tray of food before they proceed to throw away the usual 20 trays or so that are extra. The answer I was given by the CO was, "No," as he waved me on with his finger, saying, "Go back to your cell." It was only a few minutes later that one of the kitchen workers were passing by my cell, cleaning up trays left around.</br></br> 

I then asked him directly if he would be willing to get an extra tray up to me when he had the chance, if he could. He was beginning to tell me "No" because this particular CO is just trouble, as he then noticed that two cells over from mine was a tray left untouched that he would be having to grab and throw away anyways. So, he grabbed it and handed it to me as I began to hear the CO muttering something.</br></br> 

But he's got this sort of raspy, whiny-sounding voice, always complaining about something. So, I quickly shut my cell door and ate my food.</br></br>

I assumed he was telling the worker not to do that sort of thing in reference to the possible spread of COVID. Twenty minutes later, the CO arrived at my door, forcing me to sign a write-up while claiming he had told me not to bother the kitchen workers for trays and I went and did so anyway, thereby putting me on a five-day commissary and tablet restriction. What this means for me is that I won't be receiving $50 worth of food I had ordered for tomorrow, including a pad of paper and more pencils that I am now out of.</br></br> 

Beyond that, it means that, with me getting released this Friday, hopefully, that the stories I had access to only through the emails that I had sent on the tablet eight months ago will now be lost forever as I cannot copy them down on the paper.</br></br>

It means the brand new set of headphones I had just bought for the tablet are now useless. It means that the $13 I just spent on buying two movies to watch will be lost. It means I don't have a tablet of my own to make phone calls with now.</br></br> 

It means I will not be able to pass the time for the next five days by listening to the over $130 worth of the music I had purchased on the tablet at $2 per song. And, finally, it means I can't look at or watch the pictures and videos of my children that I have on the tablet that I check out daily. So, then I am immediately now forced with the challenge of: How do I deal with all this? And how do I process what just happened to me, and why?</br></br>

I realize that he feels that I may have disrespected him by disobeying what he said or what he may have thought he said. So, he felt the need to flex his might and hurt me in the ways available to him at that time. And with that, the more primitive alpha male instincts in me want to reach out to my people and give them his name so that they could then locate his address through various channels on the Web, allowing them the ability to then go put hands on him at his home or worse.</br></br> 

But, by now, it's becoming very easy for me to just accept the day for what it is rather than worry about what I wanted it to be yesterday. This ability allows me to now still enjoy the day for what it will be rather than let it go to waste, as I have now already written a new story with the last of my paper, and I will be able to get more time in to work out so that, when I go to bed tonight, I can and will feel more accomplished.</br></br>

So, yeah, that's just a quick little log of things that happen in here daily.</br></br>

UCI: Thank you.</br></br>

Caller: And now I will go ahead and read very quickly The Immaculate Concept of the Power of the Positive, which is one of my favorites. I really cherish this one. I like it a lot.</br></br>

Okay. So, what if there was a way to eventually end all suffering or at least the worst and most unnecessary form of suffering, which would be the kind of suffering caused by one person's actions to another? Surely, you'd be interested in knowing more, right? You see, for many years, I believed that suffering was the absolute way to enlightenment.</br></br> 

I believed it was such a necessary part of the process to bring about change from within. It seems to me that through the trials and tribulations of hard times would come the ability and willingness to give up on the parts of one's own personality that were based mostly on selfish mannerisms and gluttonous behaviors and that a person would then be forced to rely more on the fundamental traits of our innermost self as a sort of survival instinct to be dealing with tragic times or events.</br></br> 

In many circumstances, this proves to be true where, through tragedy, a person can be compelled to change from within and newfound strengths are developed.</br></br>

But it doesn't always work that way. For instance, revenge is something that derives specifically from having suffered. In fact, there have been many occasions in my life where something bad had happened to me. I could not rest until I responded by doing something equally hurtful back in response.</br></br> 

For a long period of time through my many years of running my own construction company, if something had gone sour with one of my projects where I wound up unpaid, my motto was, "Cost me a dollar, and I'll cost you ten," meaning that if someone damaged me in any way financially, I would see to it that the person that caused me to lose money would end up losing a lot more than me, thus making it so they knew that it just would've been cheaper to pay me what they owed me in the first place.</br></br>

But that behavior only seemed to create an endless cycle of revenge that I couldn't keep up with, as the world of construction can be a cutthroat business. Responding to violence or wrongdoing of any sort with more violence and inappropriate actions requires too much energy, time, and effort when, realistically, there's nothing to be gained by getting somebody back for what may have already occurred. It only sets you back further in life, taking up more of your valuable time and money as a result.</br></br>

For years, I kept a detailed list of all the people that had wronged me by leaving me unpaid for services rendered, sticking me with a balance owed of over $100,000 at a time, usually, which always kept me in such a state or worry and distress, feeling like, "The first chance I get, I'm going to go down my list and wreak havoc on those people." Even with me being fortunate enough to be working a full-time schedule of well-paying jobs, I seemed to be constantly looking backwards at days already spent. The baggage to all the hate and intended revenge-to-be had weighed heavy on my soul.</br></br> 

It was constantly slowing me down as I carried it with me everywhere. It kept my mind locked in a permanent state of negativity. Even with me having an endless supply of new well-paying jobs ahead of me, I was unable to appreciate the glory and magnificence of the day for what it was worth.</br></br>

It took many years, but eventually in one single moment of exhaustion from the weight of it all pressing down on me, and with the realization of what I had become and how it was costing me the day every day, I let it all go. In an instant and in a moment of clarity, I released everything attached to the hate and worries of the unpaid dues. My spirits were instantly lifted as I was now free from it all. I took that list, and I threw it away, thinking that it would solve all my problems.</br></br> 

And for a time, that was true. I was finally able to just look forward toward the rewards that tomorrow would bring.</br></br>

But as time went on, and as sure as the world goes around, I seemed to find myself right back where I started. Where, as usual, this or that would happen and here and there jobs are going, hey, once again I found myself sharpening my knife for revenge. But only this time, something's different. Something had changed from within me. Whether it be from past experiences or simply the wisdom that comes of age, suddenly I was able to see the big picture.</br></br> 

I was finally able to see what had been right in front of me the whole time.</br></br>

Suddenly, it was as if I was staring straight into the matrix and I could see the individual components that made up the construct of our entire existence. From out of nowhere, all the ones and zeros became visible to me, with the ones being all the positives in this life and the zeros being all the negatives. I finally saw clearly this ripple effect happening all around me, affecting our entire social existence.</br></br> 

It appeared to me as if our entire civilization was equivalent to a giant body of water with these constant positive and negative ripples bouncing back and forth endlessly. These ripples would then have an effect on everything they touched or came across.</br></br>

It became clear to me that the negative experiences I was having didn't even necessarily derive from the here and now happening right in front of me but were often attached to a chain of negative experiences that seemed to be flowing endlessly through the people around me. This brought me to the realization that any negative action I was to take and any revenge I may seek would thereby affect that person's actions towards future encounters with others that had not yet even occurred, thus affecting the entire world around me in a negative manner. So, in a way, by hurting back those that have hurt me, I was then hurting everything and everyone around me.</br></br>

That feeling sank deep into my soul. My wish then became to find a way to clean and restore the balance within our interactions and our humanity. It was at that time that the immaculate concept of the power of the positive really took hold of me.</br></br> 

I understood how necessary it was to respond to negative actions and influences with positive ones in return. This would then cancel out that negative ripple once and for all that may have been bouncing its way through our civilization for years or even centuries, for all we know.</br></br>

It's not always going to be easy, but it's now with these efforts that, over time, we stand a chance of eradicating the negative in our lives that we are all forced to experience from time to time. These efforts could, in theory, eventually lead us down a road towards a future without the suffering attached to negative experiences inflicted by one person to another, which to me is a far worse kind of suffering than that which is attached to natural causes. In life, there will always be certain things that we just can't change or avoid.</br></br> 

But by maintaining positivity in this world, one thing is for sure, that we will all live in a better world while providing a better future for our loved ones.</br></br>

I write this with hope that people will read it and understand just how important being positive is. I write this with hope that we'll have the strength to do so. I write this so that others and even I, myself, will be able to maintain the integrity of being like a rock - better than that, being like a mountain in this raging sea of negative waves and ripples; that, as they begin to break and crash upon our shores of our own existence, that we may have the power to make sure that they simply then evaporate as the buck stops here. And as the tide rolls out, it carries with it only our love and positive intentions.</br></br>

And that's the end of that one. I thought that's one of my favorites.</br></br>

UCI: That was [great].</br></br>

Caller: Oh, thank you.</br></br>

UCI: Thanks for sharing that.</br></br>

Caller: You're welcome. And I do have one more for you called The Proof, but I'll leave that. Then I could do it tomorrow, I guess. But in the meantime, I could read you this quick tidbit.</br></br> 

I may have time for another. It's not quite six o'clock yet.</br></br>

UCI: Okay, yeah.</br></br>

Caller: I was digging through my tablet over the weekend, just jotting these two stories down, and I found several more that I had forgotten about. And I'm going to miss a couple forever because I can't copy them down. But I managed to scoop this one off there. And now, with this one, you have to keep in mind it was written last year in 2020, our official year of the COVID, you know?</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>

Caller: And it was written on 2020. It's titled Hate. It's sort of like a reverse psychology, little haiku sort of poem but not really written in that form. But, okay. So, it's called Hate.</br></br>

I hate the way this year has been. I hate this Christmas. I hate last Thanksgiving. I hate being in jail through it all. I hate time itself. I hate having no control over anything in here.</br></br> 

I hate the system. I hate being helpless. I hate being useless. I hate being forced to be alive when I didn't ask for any of this. I hate death, always knowing it's coming someday but never having a choice as to when.</br></br>

I hate COVID for taking so much from us. I hate being me. I hate when love is lost. I hate lack of sympathy. I hate lack of empathy. I hate when things go wrong.</br></br> 

I hate imprisonment. I hate suffering. I hate not being able to end all suffering. I hate what's become of our society. I hate making mistakes. I hate not learning from those mistakes.</br></br>

I hate people hating me. I hate bad people. I hate what I'm doing. I hate unfairness. I hate not getting another chance.</br></br> 

I hate youth slowly slipping away. I hate people hurting me. I hate turning the other cheek. I hate being so strong but feeling so weak.</br></br> 

I hate being away from my beautiful children through the holidays. I hate myself for letting it happen. But mostly I hate hating, and I hate hate.</br></br>

And that's that one. What time is it? Yeah, I'm doing okay. I have something else I want to tell you about COVID.</br></br> 

I have a way to cure it and stop all the deaths from happening, but it's a little complicated and it'll take about five to ten minutes to explain. Now that I've now had COVID and I've studied it well, it's something that attacks you mostly in your sleep.</br></br>

And by inducing coma and keeping people bedridden, their preexisting conditions are hijacked by COVID, and they're enraged. And [unintelligible] overnight causes death. But, otherwise, if you keep them pretty much active and feed them through the day, make them sit up and just deal with the pain or whatever their preexisting condition is, then they stand a chance of surviving it. But I'll go more into that tomorrow when I call back with more time. It's stopping any second now.</br></br>

UCI: All right.</br></br>

Caller: There's a clock here. So, I appreciate your time, and I will talk to you guys tomorrow. Thank you.</br></br>

UCI: Okay. Thank you. Okay. Thank you.</br></br>

Caller: You're welcome. 'Bye.</br></br>

UCI: Bye.</br></br>
