Life itself, whether an individual is free or incarcerated, is never truly easy. Nature is constantly throwing us curve balls around every corner we turn. Each one making an impact of varying ferocity. COVID-19 is one of such curve balls that when is most impact it hit so hard has knocked me off my feet.</br></br>
I am now, 24 years old and have been locked up for three years now. I have only been in California for three months before my arrest. All my family is in Louisiana and Arkansas, causing the past few years to be filled with loneliness, and up until COVID-19, I thought it could not get any worse.</br></br>
 Prison itself is horrible, but once you are in prison during an epidemic, you know hell on earth. I was in vocational training learning about HVAC when a seroyer came up to us and our insecure that our facility was now on quarantine, a correctional officer in our yard had positive. Within a month we were inside our dorms on bunks, no more than four feet way from each other. A month later, nearly a hundred inmates went into isolation.
