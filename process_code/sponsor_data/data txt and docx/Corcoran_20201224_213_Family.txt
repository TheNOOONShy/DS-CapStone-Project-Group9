We are isolated and confined to our cells, yet I’m seeing friends in here get taken away to designated blocks that house the dying and sick COVID inmates.</br></br>

Now the lack of communication with our families has been hard to cope with. No visits have made it difficult on my mother, harder than ever in any way. I was so lucky, though, that before they shut down and halted visits in January 2020, I had the ample opportunity to see my mother and stepdad. But I wonder afterwards if that would be the last time I see them?</br></br>

That’s part of the uncertainty and anxiety that I speak of. I hate that prison officials can’t grasp that communication with our loved ones is healthy and vital for all. They have the money to allow video visitation, but they rather see us suffer.
