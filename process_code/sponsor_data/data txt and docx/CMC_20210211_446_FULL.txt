This letter was written by a person incarcerated at CMC (California Men's Colony).</br></br>

Thank you for the well wishes of health during the COVID-19 pandemic. As well as the opportunity to express my feelings and thoughts as an inmate of the California Men’s Colony State Prison.</br></br>
 
I’m currently serving a 28-year term for PC 211 robbery and PC 243 battery. Eighteen years in, through plenty of adversity and tribulations, this pandemic has caused a constant emotional and mental state of duress.</br></br>
 
There have been several outbreaks inside these walls, and I feel the responses were inadequate due to the lack of procedures. For example, CMC was granted funds for the pandemic which were used to build an outbreak center on C-facility of CMC.</br></br>
 
Two huge circus tents were erected with porta-potties and shower units. They were erected and taken down way too early. I state that because the facility could have been used for the numerous outbreaks.</br></br>

CMC shuttles infected COVID-19 inmates with negative inmates. Which means instead of being confined to living quarters, we’re all in single cells. We are transferred to C-facility.</br></br>
 
I’m personally on A-facility, but have been moved to C-facility for two weeks. Our vitals were monitored twice a day for possible symptoms during this time. There is no movement so no phone calls to loved ones or those held dear to convey your circumstances or hear how your family is holding up in society dealing with government shut down, loss of employment.</br></br>
 
December 18, 2020 I was transferred to Sierra Vista Hospital with COVID symptoms. Due to overcrowding I remained by the outside entrance for an hour. I am grateful they brought out warm blankets to cover me while awaiting admittance.</br></br>
 
Once admitted, the nurses and doctors were thorough except for giving me the standard COVID-19 test. The nasal and/or mouth swab. Diagnosis, COVID symptoms instead of positive. Which kept me from being admitted to an intake room.</br></br>
 
It’s almost indescribable to go through COVID-19 without having a loved one or someone dear near or even knowing what you’re going though. Your only company, two armed correctional officers and the two medical personnel of the ambulance. Left leg (shackled to a gurney) and watching strangers walk past you. A clarity moment of life and possibility of death.</br></br>
 
Due to the pandemic, contact visiting has been suspended. Thirty-minute video chats has been implemented for once a month. Although appointments are rare, I’ve been waiting for months. As I write this letter, (yep) writing in an email or text era, mail we receive from outside world coming in takes a minimum of two weeks and that’s being lenient.</br></br> 

Lack of visitation and lack of mail is depressing, frustrating, helpless. Policy is set up as the pandemic continues and policy is subject to change any moment. Regarding which cell you move to, when you can work to support yourself with a Prison Industry Authority job.</br></br>

I pray in the near future the pandemic has given experiences that are learned from and protocols that make sense are implemented. In the meantime, I remain occupying my mind with reading, correspondence courses, and exercising the body regularly. As well as praying to maintain spiritual strength to cope with this crisis.</br></br>
 
This missive is my reality. Random thoughts are expressed. Thank you for lending an ear to my venting. Take care, be safe, remain vigilant with precautions.</br></br>
 
Best wishes.
