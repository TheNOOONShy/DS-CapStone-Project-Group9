This story was told by a person incarcerated at San Bernardino Central Detention Center.</br></br>

Caller:	Well, my experience with COVID-19, you know like - I've been like - there are like - the toll has - I've been incarcerated like - you know and my experience really is my experience has been great, but obviously not - not for a lot of us - a lot of - a lot of different people - a lot of family members. But yeah, like with my experience I just - being in jail back-to-back, and from like - I had two type of perspectives, like you know what I'm saying?</br></br> 

From a - I have a perspective from the outside and a perspective - I realized how different - how the outside of being free. And I know like how experiences - I've seen a lot, and I've noticed a lot. And you know like it's all - like the people that be in jail don't realize how much our people that are out there suffering.</br></br> 

As though like - when I go to like - when I fell for anything like that, I notice that my mom or any of my loved ones, like I feel like they are doing the time with me too, you know. Like, cause you know, they are missing their loved one, some are like - and you just think you're alone, you know. You have people out there that are - that are going through the same thing you are because they miss you.</br></br>

So that's what I - that's what I've been notice - realizing. Like every time I get locked up, my mom is doing the time with me too, you know? So like what I got out of that is like it makes you think - I've been making better decisions.</br></br>

And you know, I just - I just also noticed like how it is like for anyone - I tell you like experience is - like I can't explain it, but I can. You know what I mean? Like I've gone - I've been in for a while, like the whole two years and every time I go back in, I see how other - how other inmates are going through the same thing as well.</br></br>

As if we got to make better decisions, you know. Like, with all the pandemic that's going on, it's like not making it any better, you know. But, you know what I mean, what kind of a - what do you want to hear - Hello?</br></br>

UCI: I'm sorry, can you repeat that?</br></br>

Caller: What kind of - what kind of things like do you guys want to hear?</br></br>

UCI: Any - any stories you have related to COVID-19 or even your experience in prison that you want to share.</br></br>

Caller:	Alright, well with COVID-19 you know, I was saying I - I lost an aunt you know — my aunt. She just recently died from COVID and you know me being in jail, and you know like I can't really do much from inside here but just, you know, pay my respects.</br></br> 

Like I - I've been through a lot - any - anybody else that lost a family member while being incarcerated here gives me - you know like? My experience being locked up like, you know what I - I've felt that a lot of young individuals - like one of the main downfalls that we have, like, most of the time that young individuals get locked up because they're on drugs.</br></br>

And you know what I'm saying? Like pretty sure you have people that were on drugs and half the things they did if they were sober - responded to my flaw was drugs. I didn't — I'm not going to say what of law like - what got me locked up was, you know, saying like, if I were sober as I am right now, I would have never done any of the things that I did to get me in jail.</br></br>

You know like I've been - I've been through a lot in here, and I was beaten up, I'm not going to say because of drugs, yeah but at the same time, yeah, I would've never been going through the things that I went through if I was - if I were not on drugs. I just went through a downfall after - after me and my - after me and the mother of my kids had split. It just leads me to drugs and - and I saying that.</br></br>

I just got myself too deep into it, you know, to even get out like. Barely now I'm barely - barely stepping out and - and like just like talking to myself and saying "You know what I did, I don't want to live this life. I'm not - not gonna foster it - to raise my kids — my two sons that I got now."</br></br> 

I got to do that like - it has taken two years — two, three years of my - of my freedom to want to make a change. And like you know what I'm seeing?</br></br> 

To any like - to any young individual out there man, that - that - that wanted to know about and messing up in life, and don't think it's over, man. You gotta understand, there's inmates here that aren't going home for like - there's just. It's just decisions that people make that they never - that they wish they never made.</br></br>

If you have a chance also to do good, go ahead and don't - don't regret it later in life - like I'm telling from experience from me right now to do it better. There's better out there or better than this. And you know that's all I really have to say.</br></br>

UCI: Well thank you - thank you for sharing. Yeah, is there any - any other other stories you want to share related to your experience with the pandemic?</br></br>

Caller:	The pandemic?</br></br>

UCI: Yes, like how has the pandemic affected you while you were inside?</br></br>

Caller:	Well honestly, it did affect me like because like one of the things that drew me like not being on the streets and during the pandemic a lot of that stopped, you know, cuase there's no game going on and that was my help - for being like - for the future or anything like if I would have - if I would have [unintelligible] instead of doing drugs and living on the streets, I would have probably never gotten into any trouble with COVID.</br></br>

The COVID you know like pushed me - [unintelligible] I'm not saying the COVID like did that - but it was because of - because of that I did - I didn't - [unintelligible] my family everybody, you know?</br></br>

I'm not blaming the COVID because, of course, COVID didn't put a gun to my head, but I am just saying like it drew me into - to not — you know? I'm saying - I'm putting like - I want to say that COVID isn't just all of the [unintelligible], and you know what I'm saying?</br></br>

It - it just damaged a lot of people in my life, made me not accomplish anything I still want to accomplish - but I still have a chance in life, and I'm going go ahead and take it, you know. And that - I'm just trying to lead an example to any other young - young individual out there that - that wants to as well.</br></br>
