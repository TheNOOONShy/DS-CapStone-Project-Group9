This story was told by a person incarcerated at Solano.</br></br>Caller: To begin, I think it's important for a lot of people out there to understand that a lot of times when you see public policies being announced by the California Department of Corrections, that policy is something that the higher ups have put in effect. But by the time it makes it to the local levels within the institution it’s left at the discretion of local bodies as, as to how it is being implemented— if it gets implemented at all.</br></br>UCI: Hm.</br></br>Caller: So, what we have to look at here, with this whole situation with COVID is, over the course of the last six to seven months, there's been a number of protocols the CDCR has, uh, proclaimed to have implemented and, made public in various meetings and so forth that, that, you know, these steps were being taken to protect the inmate population, etc., etc.</br></br>
Now, be mindful. Again, these mandates and so forth, may very well be with good intentions when they come out of the headquarters in Sacramento. But by the time they hit the local level is again left at the whim or discretion of the particular officers transporting prisoners, the wardens, the captains.</br></br>
UCI: Hm.</br></br>Caller: So, what we're seeing here at Solano, for example, is, uh, we're seeing prisoners, as of recently, the transfers have begun again.</br></br>UCI: Okay.</br></br>Caller: And so, I believe the CMC, they had this big outbreak down there, 300-400 prisoners. And so, CDC puts in this protocol that says, okay, there's a 15-day isolation period, we can get you tested, isolated, then put on a bus, isolated again, cleared, and allowed into general population.</br></br>
Well, this testing isn't happening for every person that’s getting on that bus and getting transferred. And they say, “Well, if you previously had COVID in the 14-day, 15-day window, we don't have to test you.” Well, that's not the case here with these prisoners that are getting transferred.</br></br>I just asked, as of a couple of days ago, sit down talking to a brother who just got transferred in from another prison. And I asked, okay, “Hey man, the CDC has this policy, and they're saying that they're not doing, um, no transfers with the exception of like, you know, medical emergencies, R&R, county jail type of stuff.”</br></br>UCI: Yes.</br></br>Caller: So, I asked him, so I asked him, I said, “Hey, what’s your situation? Why was it that you and all these other brothers who come from CMC get transferred?" And speaking for himself he said, well, something about the elevation, his transfer had expired, but they put him on the bus anyways. Okay? I said, “When they put you in a bus, did they do a COVID test?” He said no.</br></br>
“Did they isolate you?” “No.” “So, you’re telling me from the point of your departure to arriving at this prison at no point you tested for COVID. At no point was you, uh, isolated to determine whether or not you had any symptoms, anything like that?” He said, “Absolutely not. They put me on a bus, turned me loose on the yard.”</br></br>UCI: Wow. And so, they didn't give him any tests prior to that, even before then, like, like days or a week before, or it just right before he was transferred?</br></br>
Caller: Never been tested for COVID. So, I asked him, “Have you ever been transferred, I mean, ever been tested for COVID?” He said no. I said, “Have you ever contracted COVID?” He says, “Well, I had the symptoms.” And, you know, the stuff really messed me up. I lost my taste, you know, mouth taste.</br></br>
UCI: Oh yeah.</br></br>
Caller: Yeah. So, I was just like, “Wow, and then they put you on a bus without testing you?” So, I'm thinking like, okay, here we go again, San Quentin all over again, you know.</br></br>UCI: Hm.</br></br>Caller: And, so, right now, that's what's currently happening in the California Department of Corrections. Now, over the course of the last six or seven months, here at Solano there was a particular prisoner who had did a VICE News video— an interview on VICE News. And tha-that video wind up going viral. Uh. I think last we heard something like maybe half a million hits.</br></br>UCI: Wow.</br></br>Caller: And it was just being played everywhere. And so, that particular guy, uh, wound up being retaliated against by the prison administration for reporting at that time what they was portraying to be doing in the public eye but what was really happening in the system in terms of, they wasn’t receiving any face masks, there wasn’t no possibility of social distancing, there was no, uh, disinfectants or alcohol-based sanitizers, anything like that being provided. Yet, the CDC had put this public memo out saying that they was providing all of this stuff.</br></br>
Now again, that memo came out of headquarters and by the time they reached locally...nothing. And so, uh, you know, here it is, you got this guy who blows the whistle. And he reaches out, he does this interview on VICE News.</br></br>
And so here's, here's where, you know, dealing with the public, what they don't understand about these, these, uh, uh, CDCR is, these officers function like gangs in potential. So, instead of the old days where they would, you know, push up the cop in the closet and beat the crap out of you, what they do, they go take 10-15 baskets together, and this particular guy was Black, then they turn around and tell you this, this or this, because with the Blacks the whole cells are being searched. Now, anybody who knows anything about prison politics, though, that is like one of the things that will get a race riot taking off quick.</br></br>
UCI: Right.</br></br>Caller: And so, fortunately this particular guy was able to, uh, negate the situation because there was level heads involved. And they were able to resolve the situation without it resulting in violence. Yet, the fact that you had correctional staff who were attempting to cause this disruption of violence within the prison system because this guy had reported on the COVID thing and basically put the department on blast in terms of their deceptive, uh, uh, PR and stuff that they sellin’ to the public, is something that we see happening not only throughout California but around the nation where prisoners are taking that risk to say, “Hey, look, they're telling you guys out there that they're doing A, B and C to protect us but that's not what's happening.”</br></br>
And the next thing you notice is that this person is getting transferred, he is getting going in the hole, he's getting writeups, I mean, the whole nine. And, this is how the system works, sadly. And unfortunately, a lot of people out there, uh, they don't know who the real crooks are. And so, when it comes to what uniforms a person wears, they see blue and they crumble. But the reality of this, the uniform has nothing to do with the mentality.</br></br>
UCI: Right. Did you feel like it’s, uh, is it, is it widespread throughout California or is it, you know, unique to your situation at your facility or is it, is it, you know, is it a case-by-case basis in terms of the facility?</br></br>
Caller: Well, I would say it's a case-by-case basis due to the facility. Nevertheless, the brutality in retaliation is probably systematic systemwide, and I can, I can honestly say that, as a result of that guy’s video, it kinda made the officials here at Solano step they game up.</br></br>
But now, here it is, you know, six, seven months later and, you know, maybe they don't have control over the situation in terms of who’s coming into this joint, and what they are doing on the other end before they get you. But what they're doing here, it appears that they are trying to take all reasonable steps at this prison to, uh, uh, safeguard the prisoner population as well as staff from the spread of the COVID-19.</br></br>
UCI: And this was only because of the video, the viral video?</br></br>
Caller: Yeah, because with that video hit, you know, uh, we were able to talk to the guy and, you know, everything that rolled down from that situation he informed us with this conversation he had with the cop, with the captain, conversations he had with the IGI. And basically, what they informed him was hey, man, you brought a lot of heat on the administration, there’s people in Sacramento now it's breathing down our throats. We're getting your ass out of here as soon as possible.</br></br>
Fortunately, fortunately, this guy, because of the video, he was able to reach out and I believe it was the, uh, the legal services for prisoners with children, and they assisted him with filing a writ and everything to attempt to forestall the retaliation because now they're trying to transfer this guy to the other end of the state, to a COVID hotspot.</br></br>
UCI: Mm. Oh. Man. That's, uh, that’s unfortunate and, you know, I mean it's also, I think it’s, uh, you know, when we heard about the letters coming out of San Quentin as well, it sounds like it's something that's consistently happening throughout the state. I'm not 100% sure like you said, you know, case-by-case basis. But yeah, I mean, I've heard some things that are similar to this. And do you think that...let me see some of these questions.</br></br>
So, as of right now, do you feel safe or do you feel like, like there's still some other things that, that, that is, is there a way that you could feel safer? Are they handling things better in terms of, I mean, I know you said that social distancing and I think they're probably...you guys have, uh, masks stuff now. But are there still consistent outbreaks and are they, are they still transferring people in?</br></br>
Caller: Well, you know, like I said, they're, they're trying to stay on top of the best they can but it's always one of those things that linger in the back of the mind just how much protection can you move forward to get something like this. And, uh, you know, there's been numerous instances of false positive cases, isolation of various buildings, and people are being sent to isolation.</br></br>
So, it's not that the administration here is not trying to stay on top of it the best they can. Uh. And, in terms of just feeling safe, I don't think nobody feels safe right now with COVID either they’re in prison or on the streets.</br></br>
UCI: Yeah, right. And so, at the beginning of the outbreak, you mentioned there was nothing happening. Now you guys have a little bit of stuff. Sounds like it's being handled differently now. And so, and so, now we're about eight months into this and, um, and so, how do you think this is like, I mean, obviously the visitation is done, right? And there's no visitors or are you guys getting visitors right now?</br></br>
Caller: Oh, there’s no visitors statewide as far as I’m informed.</br></br>
UCI: Right. Right. No programming?</br></br>Caller: You know, there’s modified programs, some joints are in lockdown. I mean, that's facility and facility, it varies. I think, I think in terms of like, the biggest issue right now is mental health. You know, prison as repressive as it is, we do have a daily routine to where we can get out and exercise, we can, you know, partake in group activities, recreation. All of those things have pretty much came to a pause.</br></br>And so, you have a very limited program, uh, no visitation, phone calls is pretty much the only communication we have with the outside world. And, I think it started to weigh on a lot of people, you know. So, it’s one of those things, I think frustrations are mounting in terms of people who are not, uh, you know, able to access, you know, mental health, recreation, the families, stuff like that right?</br></br>Because we all know the issue with the phones, phone calls and stuff like that. Not everybody can afford, you know, to be callin’ their family like that, so, so, that's probably one of the pressing issues right now and the whole issue.</br></br>UCI: Hm. Is there anything that you've been doing specifically to cope with this crisis, like, what do you have a routine that you do, I mean, what do you do to deal with this?</br></br>Caller: Well, you know, uh, prison, prison has taught me over the years that I've been incarcerated, and I've been incarcerated for quite some time, uh, you kinda go with the flow of things and you try to keep yourself focused on doing with what assist you to get through your day. So, for me, what is exercising in the cell, or reading, I mean, the basics of writing, studying and, you know, just trying to stay focused.</br></br>
But even so, you feel this sense of being out of the loop of everything that’s going down because you gotta look at what's happening. You got a lot of us who are waiting for court dates, we got, you know, pending legal matters, and, you know, courts have been impacted to where this is like the legal process is coming in like a dribble. So, uh, even like access to the library, all this stuff has been severely restricted. And, uh, yeah, people are just, you know, trying to get through the best they can right now.</br></br>UCI: Yeah. Yeah. I can only imagine. Uh. Is there, is there anything else that you want people to know about your experience right now?</br></br>Caller: Well, I just, uh, would like to say thank you for all the supporters out there for one. Those who are currently, you know, putting pressure on the California Department of Corrections in terms of making them step up and protect the, protect the lives of the incarcerated loved ones. I think, also, it's important for people on the streets to know that, uh, you know, we are human beings in here despite our mistakes that we've made in life.</br></br>We shouldn't be subject to a death sentence by something that can, you know, be prevented with the proper discretion in terms of, you know, public officials as these officers and administrators are to be simply following the procedures and rules set by, set forth by the governor of California.</br></br>And that's like one of the biggest problems in here is, you know, everybody has this attitude, particularly staff, that, “Nobody tells me what to do. I'm the one with the knowledge and I'm telling you guys to put your mask on, but I'm not gonna work on it.” And so, you know, what we see on the yard is the only time these officers they put the mask on is if this brass walking around. They're the ones who’re bringing this stuff in.</br></br>So, you know, again, just wanna thank the supporters out there in the streets. And you guys there, at the underground railroads for everything you guys do, undergrad scholars, excuse me. Yeah.
