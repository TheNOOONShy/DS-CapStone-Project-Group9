This story was told by a person incarcerated at Chuckawalla.</br></br>Caller: I don’t believe the medical staff really knew how to deal with the pandemic. They kind of panicked in the beginning. Maybe, unknown, not knowing, what the - how it was gonna affect people. We had people move from the yards to create a, from one yard to create a quarantine unit.</br></br> 

But I found out that a number of those people, those inmates that were moved, they were moved into yards that were positive inmates. So, it got to them quicker than it did to the yard that they were on.</br></br>  And some of the process, the procedures were very questionable. But that’s what you get when you’ve got the quality of staff, that medical staff that we do have here. But generally, I mean I was a lucky one, I didn’t have many symptoms so, even, even following the rules that were set, most, a lot of people didn’t believe, and didn’t follow the rules with masks, social distancing.</br></br> 

They still don’t, and that’s, that’s a mentality of the people, not just here, I think over the country generally. So, we’re - things to me it’s not as bad as it could have been. In a way we’re quite safe in here now. So, that’s how I see it, okay?
