This letter was written by a person incarcerated at CSATF (California Substance Abuse Treatment and State Prison, Corcoran). </br> </br>       It’s been hectic being “inside” during the pandemic, protest, politics, etc. Feels unreal. I feel so outta touch with the world. As for as inside it’s hell. I say they don’t know what they’re doing. I’m guessing because this has never happened before. Once people became positive, hold on rewind. </br> </br>       First we wasn’t given mask until May. And they were made out of old shirts and pants by other inmates while staff wore regular mask. Once people tested nobody was positive. Word is staff brought in it. Well how else did it or would it had got in right? </br> </br>       They made people who tested positive move to other parts of the prison instead of quarantining them. Then the remaining people who were left in the pod (eight man living quarters), they moved them in other pods with people who didn’t test positive. When they should’ve been quarantined as well being they was exposed. </br> </br>       Everyone is concerned about their safety, well being, health. There is a lack of cleaner disinfectant, sanitation, etc. There has been 15 deaths that I know of. There’s NO way to social distance. You can't control how the next person carries themself. It’s sad. </br> </br>
