This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Vacaville.</br></br>Thank you for taking an interest in us! It is very much appreciated! I do appreciate your concern - as of now, I am doing as well as can be expected. After all, I am 72 years old. And, recently, I fought stage four metastatic cancer which had spread from my bladder to my liver, lungs and bones. Six months of chemotherapy was not nice at all. My treatment was at UCSF - Mission Bay.</br></br>When COVID-19 first hit the news (March, 2020), they pretty much closed down all programming here at the California Medical Facility. We started out by being fed in our cells or dormitories. (which is still happening now!) That meant that no more eating at the chow halls - which hold up to 300 inmates at one time.</br></br>They started giving the first shot of Moderna vaccine to inmates with "high risk!" (of course, we were all wearing masks since the beginning!) I received my first dose on December 29, 2020. On December 31, 2020, at 11:15 pm, I was told that I had to move to a cell for observation. They moved me to a cell in a different wing - saying that I tested positive for COVID-19.</br></br>At that time, I had to move all of my property to a different wing. On January 4, 2021, I was given another COVID-19 test. Two days later, I was moved to a big dorm that housed the COVID inmates. In D-Dorm, I really reacted to the virus. Apparently, I slept for days - even passing up meals!</br></br>Then, a friend told me about an IV that helped him. The IV took an hour, but the next day, I was feeling pretty good! On January 15, 2021, they moved me (and others) out to the "Tent City." That was not a good experience! The wind was really blowing hard! Then on January 18, 2021, they moved all of us to another wing on the third floor. To [redacted], which was a bunk bed!</br></br>(About 12 or 13 years ago, I was moved from [redacted] down to [redacted], on the [redacted] floor. They said that I was inappropriately housed!) I am still waiting on an appeal that I had to file to get back to [redacted]. We were all promised that we would return to our beds when we got better! So far, that part has not been true!</br></br>I did receive my second shot of Moderna on March 30, 2021 - 60 days after the IV. While I do not have any complaints regarding previous healthcare, I kind of feel like they put everyone in a position to get the virus. I hope that that is not, but I can't help feeling that way! I have been here for 28 years now. Something has been different by the way that they have handled things.</br></br>I hope that this helps you out with your project. You can use my name if you want to! Be well and stay safe.
