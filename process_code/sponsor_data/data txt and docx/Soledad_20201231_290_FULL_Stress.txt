Hello my fellow human,</br></br>

Just received your words of concern and kindness. Thanks for the acknowledgment, and yes we all go through things and come up out of them in different ways. Fortunately or unfortunately I come from an area in Los Angeles known as “The Low Bottoms,” the ghetto if you will!</br></br>

So coming from hard times, conditioned me for a pandemic. Taking the good with the bad, the bitter with the sweet. As for as how we’re being treated in here?! I think the administration is doing as much as they can to preserve their livestock investment. You know, it is what it is.</br></br>

Hopefully this chapter of my life will be over by July 2021. I go to the board and try to be found suitably in March, wish me luck.
