This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Folsom State Prison.</br></br>


Hello [redacted], how are you doing?</br></br>


It was a pleasant surprise hearing from your organization,I apologize for taking so long to respond to your letter. I am afraid that my schedule is really busy at the moment. The institution partnered with [redacted] University at [redacted] and established a Bachelors in Arts program (in [redacted]) at Folsom. I was fortunate enough to be accepted into the program, and have been getting re-acquainted with the University life since January. As you know, COVID protocols have made everyone’s life quite challenging. We have been attending all of your classes via zoom, which has taken a bit longer to get used to. I am happy to have been given the opportunity to continue my education, a lot older and a little wiser, I definitely have a greater appreciation for this second chance.</br></br>


In your letter, you were inquiring as to whether I would be interested in submitting stories to your project. I would not have a problem with submitting stories personally, but I will probably need to find out if the institution has a problem with it. Under normal circumstances I would have a problem, because I know that I have a right to communicate with people in the outside community. However, I am currently one of the Editors (there are four of us including the Editor in Chief) of the Institutions News Paper [redacted]. It has been operating since November of 2019, with our first edition running in December.</br></br>


For the last year or so, we were on hiatus because the institution was having difficulty financing the printing of the paper. That combined with the COVID outbreaks that slowed prison operations, caused the institution to put us on the self. We were recently given the green light to begin operating again (actually, within the last two weeks), which has further delayed my response to you. What is interesting about your inquiry, relates to the future of our operations. We have actually been seeking the assistance of interested organizations, who were willing to invest available resources into the continued operations of [redacted]. I believe that the opportunity to mentor some aspiring journalist and writers, while helping us sharpen our editorial and production skills may turn out to be a mutually beneficial partnership. I do have plans to call the number that you provided, in order to continue this discussion. Please feel free to contact me at the indicated address, and I will look forward to hearing from you.</br></br>


Sincerely.
