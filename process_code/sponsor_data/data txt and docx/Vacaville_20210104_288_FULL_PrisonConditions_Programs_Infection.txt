Hello PrisonPandemic,</br></br>
 
I can’t read or write or spell, but I’m going to do the best I can. I’m at CMF prison in Vacaville. I’m writing you and hoping you can help me or tell me where to get some help. On or around the first part of December 2020 my whole dorm was put in the hole (ad seg).</br></br>

Due to COVID-19, we were on a quarantine already, but CDCR here at CMF did not enforce it very well. And so someone in my dorm went to work. And so he had been going to work for about a week or so. Medical came and got him and three days we were put on quarantine.</br></br>

And no one was to go to work or phone in the big hallway. But we had a guy still going to work and about three day after he was going to work, medical came and got him and said he had COVID-19. And we were all going to the hole, just not the rest of the wing.</br></br>
 
The last guy medical came and got. Medical said he got COVID-19 from staff at work. My point is, he was not to be going to work. I have a HC petition in the Supreme Court. I’m sending you a copy. We have no law library, no plugs, no yard, etc.</br></br>

The California Supreme Court wanted an informal response by December 2020 from me. I can’t read or spell and I’m a ADA inmate with a learning disability. I had a guy in here in the hole try help me, but this is not right, no law library, nothing.</br></br>
 
I’m 64 years old next month. I get out in June 2022. I have appeal this all the way and now it seems CDCR has where I can’t get any help. I’m very sick, also, I have doctors app. on the streets to go to. But due to COVID-19 can’t go.</br></br>

I use a walker, wear diapers. Also from the first of December 2020 CMF, we have been told went from 30 cases of COVID to around 300 to 400 as of today. Hole dorms and over 15 to 200 staff. I did get the informal response on December 2020 from attorney general. Can you help me out here. Thank you so much.</br></br>
 
Thank God I don’t have COVID yet.
