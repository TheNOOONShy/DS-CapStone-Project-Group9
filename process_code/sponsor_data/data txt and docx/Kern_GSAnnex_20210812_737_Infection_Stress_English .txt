This story was told by a person incarcerated at an ICE/Private-Contractor facility.</br></br>
UCI: Talk to me about your story with COVID 19, please.</br></br> Caller: The story isn't personal, but with a neighbor in which I had to look at him very closely and, Thank God, I didn't contract it, but with a neighbor, looking at the beginning of this disease, that is a reality. He would only say "Give me an analgesic or acetaminophen, something, "but really suffering is strong at the beginning, you are starting to fail, feeling very cold and the most surprising is when the sense of smell and taste is lost.</br></br>

So, it's part of being impotent, being close to someone who is going through this and it's totally difficult because these are new diseases in which no one can lead or advise or no one knows what to pay attention to, and only sometimes one grasps some parts of this disease.</br></br> 

UCI: Seriously?</br></br>

Caller: But following some of the information we get from those who are more knowledgeable about this disease, like doctors in general. Sometimes, a person being close to this person who is suffering.</br></br>

UCI: Yes, Yes.</br></br>

Caller: Knowing that you can do is to encourage them to do this or that, although one is not a doctor, but at least not to destroy them the sick person even more. It's very difficult.</br></br> 

UCI: Yes so bad.</br></br>

Caller: Even if you only try by giving Tylenol or a little water.</br></br>

UCI: That's good.</br></br>

Caller: It's something a person can do and well, Thank God, we have information through media like television or radio which helps us orient ourselves even though we are far away. And well, suffering [unintelligible].</br></br>

UCI: Wow.</br></br>

Caller: Is very extreme when it comes to that disease which is a reality. This is part of the experience of observing how this disease or virus damages and attacks.
