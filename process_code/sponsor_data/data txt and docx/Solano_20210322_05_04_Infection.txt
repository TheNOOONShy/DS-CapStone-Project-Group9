This story was told by a family member of someone incarcerated at Solano.</br></br> 

Caller: Okay, there was one other thing that really bothered me about how they handled it-</br></br>

UCI: Absolutely.</br></br>

Caller: Was one of their employees had come down with the COVID, and he was still going to work, and they allowed it.</br></br>

UCI: Oh wow, did they test the individual at all? Or did they not test?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, he had tested positive they called his work and told them that he tested positive, and they still let him go to work.</br></br>

UCI: Oh, and how did you, all you know, feel about that? was it across all employees they were doing this? Or was it just one?</br></br>

Caller: Not that we're aware of. As far as we’re aware of, it was only the one employee. But that's all that we’re aware of, but I'm saying if it happened to one employee and they found out about it, it's probably happened to more than one.</br></br>

UCI: Absolutely, and did you as somebody who, you know, has a loved one inside a facility, do you feel that you know the vaccination process is going okay? What are you able to gather from your fiancé?</br></br>

Caller: I think that the vaccination process is being handled a lot better than the pandemic was.</br></br>

UCI: Oh, okay. Can you explain a little bit?</br></br>

Caller: Well, they've already taken my fiancé, and he's already had both vaccinations, both shots, so even though he's never, because he's never had it, I'm assuming because he's never had it, he's one of the few there that's never had it, he got a shot. And that he's older and he has health risks.</br></br>

UCI: He did. When do you think that he was given the first dose, generally?</br></br>

Caller: I want to say, a month ago.</br></br>

UCI: Oh wow, okay, so sometime in February, that's great.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah.</br></br>

UCI: And then he got his second one pretty recently, then?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, it was just in the last week, a week and a half. Yeah, somewhere around there.</br></br>

UCI: That's great. I mean, that's amazing. Do you find, does he mention if, you know, a lot of, if there's some hesitancy with his peers, or do you see a lot of individuals also getting vaccinated?</br></br>

Caller: He didn't mention anybody else getting, being afraid of it. He did say that he got the chills and that, that was it. He got the body aches and the chills the second, during the second shot, and that they explained that to him that was gonna happen.
