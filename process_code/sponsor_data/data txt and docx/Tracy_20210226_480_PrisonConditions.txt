When COVID-19 first hit, we heard a guy was supposed to go home in about three weeks. He was transferred to a facility that had an outbreak and he died. There are countless stories like this. I’m a 40 year old man, I’m in good shape and I recently (1-5-21) had a bout with COVID-19 and even though I beat it, it was a scary time, I can imagine an older gentleman experience such a intense paranoia.</br></br>

I have witnessed so much mismanagement, this was an unprecedented event but all this was increased because as you know in about 2014, a three-judge federal court panel deemed CDCR to be overcrowded and a violation of the Eighth Amendment. If CDCR would of followed the three judges’ recommendation and released inmates in a timely manner, lives would of been saved because who would of knew the best medicine for COVID-19 is social distancing?!
