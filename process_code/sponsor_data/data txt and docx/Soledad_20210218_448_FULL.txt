COVID-19</br></br>

Puts strain on prisoners</br></br>

Pun intended</br></br>

I am responding to your form letter regarding life in prison during this pandemic. Thanks for asking. So, pandemics and prison. oil and water.</br></br>

Your first question is "What has it been like inside prison during this time"? Back in March as this pandemic was ramping up, those of us paying attention knew that it was a matter of time before it made its way into prison.</br></br> 

What we did not realize was that because this prison is in Monterey county, as are the majority of migrant workers that do not have the means to avoid the pandemic by using precautions advised, that the virus would get here as fast.</br></br>

The guards at this prison are primarily Hispanic. So it puts them even closer contact with the Hispanic population, than probably others. You then couple that with the fact that most guards here are ignorant (ignorant, not stupid) to the seriousness of this situation at this prison.</br></br> 

They have negative attitudes towards inmates and negative attitudes in general, and that is a recipe for disaster.</br></br>

Many comments like, "heh heh, that's one way to lower the prison population." As I write this, the news, KION CBS news, here locally, just aired a piece about this virus exploding in the California prisons. And here where I am specifically, as of today December 23rd, there are 839 positive cases here.</br></br>

I'll go chronologically as this thing progressed. The first thing that they did was to stop all contact visiting before a single case of COVID was in here. Smart move, yes. However, it also spotlights how incompetent the staff here have been in dealing with this pandemic.</br></br>

The spread in here was not inevitable. It was preventable, but poor attitudes, and poor administrative oversight, allowed it to enter the prison. For example, as soon as it was recommended by the CDC that people wear masks, within a reasonable amount of time, the prison issued us cloth masks that the inmate in Prison lndustry Authority (PIA) aka modern-day slavery, sewed us up for us to wear.</br></br>

There still was no known case here yet. Even though it was mandatory for all inmates and staff to wear masks, many staff scoffed at wearing them and inmates wearing them was not forced. Another example, it was known very early on that this virus was transmittable via dogs and cats, at least as carriers.</br></br>

The facility I am in has a service dog program. But because some staff here are involved with the entity that provides the dogs, possibly monetarily. And the fact that the program makes the prison look good,(lipstick on a pig?)the dog program continued for weeks possibly months. Rotating the dogs in and out of the prison to the public.</br></br>

The dogs reside here with their handlers all week. And then are picked up by the K9s for life entity that provides them or correctional staff for weekend public outings. Then after a weekend of licking, snilling, eating, petting, rolling in contaigonville, the dogs were brought back here to the isolated inmate population.</br></br> 

The staff were going to get those feathers in their hats, deadly global pandemic be damned. They still are taking the dogs in and out!</br></br>

Next, at first when the cases started exploding in here, it was in a different facility. CTF North is comprised of North, South, and Central facilities. The virus was spreading through Central facility. Not attached to us.</br></br> 

No problem. Wrong! Staff from over there would and currently still are working overtime between yards. Yes, that's right.</br></br>

Before there was a single inmate case in North facility, staff working over at the known to be infected Central facility, would work their shift over there in the hot zone, and then come pull a shift over here on North facility. That was still infection free!</br></br> 

This policy was questioned by me personally and by some staff. Answer: the guards union says you cannot deny an officer the right to get some overtime pay. Gotta make that money, right?!</br></br>

As inmates, to date, we have no access to any meaningful cleaning supplies to maintain common sense sanitary measures. We are provided a highly watered-down issue of prison made disinfectant called "Cellblock 64". No that's not a joke.</br></br>

Purportedly, at a one to one ratio, nine-one ounce to one gallon, this stuff kills everything. The problem is that it is never applied as the instructions indicate. Which say it must be sprayed or applied to hard surfaces and left wet for 10 to 15 minutes for it to be effective.</br></br>

Never happens. No bleach!</br></br>

Moving on to other safety issues. Currently in a (put a bullet proof vest on after you've been shot) move, we are on lockdown. We are locked in our cells 24/7. We are not getting yard. We are not even getting our shower, at least every 72 hours as mandated.</br></br>

Contrary to the standardized menus that are published, for public consumption, pun intended, when they put on the menu that we are being served baked ham, rice pilaf, stir fry, creamed beef, calico scrambled eggs, broccoli alfredo, chicken tetrazzini, chicken cobb salad, etc. etc.</br></br> 

I assure you, we see no such food as this. The food that we get would make hospital food seem like gourmet food. And I received bigger portions on my tray in second grade than we get here. I've measured it, one ounce of macaroni.</br></br>

And for those who say, â€œOh poor wittle inmate in his cell hungwee" that's a good one, catchy. But I say on a more mature note, since the nature of this post was to expose prison conditions during this pandemic. I say consider your dead mother, father, grandma, grandpa, kids, friends, family members, etc., that may be dead because careless prison staff created a human petri dish in which this virus has spread.</br></br>

They injected it into our sterile environment, allowed it flourish, worked in and amongst it. And then come out there to the Safeway where your mother is shopping and sneeze COVID-I9 infected droplets in here vicinity and then days later you have her cremated. Now who's the criminal? Merry Christmas!</br></br> 

But I digress.</br></br>

Does this make sense? Currently, two inmates are housed in every cell designed for one. My cell mate coughs are posterior. Could never be more than three feet way a from my face. Right now, the prison, in it wisdom is doing this: if one inmate in the cell or two test positive, they move the one off to quarantine.</br></br> 

The other stays behind. Then they move some other inmate in with the inmate that did not immediately test positive, that time.</br></br>

Next thing you know the original negative inmate does test positive on a subsequent test. They move him out to quarantine and leave the other guy behind, repeat, repeat, repeat.</br></br>

The prison was unwilling and unprepared to manage this contagion. Even though proponents of prison reform always cite the overcrowding and "That if a contagion ever got loose in one of those prisons?" well, now you don't have to wonder.</br></br> 

This is as they announce a mutant variant seventy percent more contagious. Better get some body bags!</br></br>

To the dorm</br></br>

As I begin writing this on December 23rd, and confirmed by my December 24th swab test I was negative. However, without leaving my cell for any reason to avoid COVID, when they tested me on December 30th I am now infected, as is my cellmate. Our only contact with anyone was at our door, by correctional staff, inmate food servers, and the medical staff.</br></br>

As a result of the same test on the same date, 32 inmates all in my vicinity all tested positive. We're all locked down, and no one went anywhere. So they are infecting us. The medical staff conducting our vitals, go cell to cell to cell.</br></br> 

Without changing their gloves and without cleaning the oxygen sensor they stick on our fingers one inmate after the other.</br></br>

I wonder how it is spreading? It is peculiar, that these inmate infections are happening about 30 at a time and all within the general vicinity of each other. If I didn't know better, it is as though they are infecting us in batches to ultimately achieve herd immunity, just saying.</br></br>

As a result of being infected by staff, they now have uprooted me from my cell and housed me in the dorm. I am in an open-air dorm with 156 infected inmates. The bunks are not six feet apart. I am on a top bunk nearest the main door coming into the dorm.</br></br> 

My bunk is head height so every infected inmate passes less than six feet from me, exposed on the top bunk. I wonder how it is spreading.</br></br>

Tent city</br></br>

Ten minutes ago, at 8:30 at night, I was in dorm city. Now after pushing a cart with my property in it, through the mud and cold, I have arrived at tent city. Tent city is comprised of 13 eight man tents. 12 for sick inmates and one for staff. They look like FEMAS tents.</br></br>

Last night was the third night in the tent. The tents have heating and air conditioning but someone forgot to tell the company that supplied the tents and generators that preventative maintenance must be done to ensure such things, as fuses, are in working order. The temperature in the tent this morning was 41 degrees. As it was yesterday and the day before.</br></br>

So, I'm infected with COVID, brought in by staff. And now at 2:45 am when I need to use the restroom, I get out from under every stitch of covers that I have, up off my cot, sick, and walk 50 yards to the porta-potties. In the 30-40 degree range, across the dewy wet grass to do my business. Then I head back to my frozen cot, and slip back into my wet sheets from my fever breaking.</br></br>

When the little herd of medical staff come back to do vitals, we all line up sick, outside in the weather. We could go in the 13th tent that the cops use, but the cops don't want us filthy vermin in there. Plus, it's cold outside and their heater damn sure works, so they don't want to come out in the cold.</br></br>

It's cold enough that the medical staff giggle and sheepishly ask us to stick our fingers in our pockets so that they are warm enough to provide correct readings on the equipment. Here's a real hoot for you, at least to the medical staff.</br></br>

I'm a fat white, balding, 37-year-old, but my blood pressure is normal. On one of the vital checks the machine said my blood pressure was like 187/95. I said I don't think the is right. The RN just chuckled and said â€œYeah, half the time this junk equipment doesn't work right".</br></br>

That's funny, right? I'm just a stupid inmate. That according to the CDCR gets the best medical care, even better than people on the streets. Oh and I "should have thought of that before coming to prison", right?</br></br>

Well after 15 days in the tent city, I have been, thankfully, cleared to move back to a cell. Of course, not the cell I had and not with my old cellmate. So, from beginning to end, I started in my cell, got infected by staff, went to dorm city, then tent city, and now back to a cell. Not one thing is different.</br></br> 

No new precautions. No increase in disinfecting areas. No change in staff behavior towards protocols. What was the point in all that movement?</br></br>

Phone access</br></br>

The main method of communication between the inmate and his family is the phone. As soon as the virus officially entered this prison, albeit, on a separate and unconnected yard. Staff took the correct and expedient of stopping all contact visits.</br></br>

This left US mail and Global Tel (expensive collect call system) as the only two sources for an inmate to be in contact with his family. We all know the problems and delays with the US mail even before COVID. And now you quadruple that with staff shortages within the prison because of infections amongst staff, real or feigned. They get paid whether they are here or not.</br></br>

So now we get to phones. If one is in prison, his relationship is already stressed and strained, and now I'll describe a 15-minute phone call. First, as a result of cost cutting, and CTF being an old prison, the phones, 18 of them in a row, for 1,200 inmates, are located outside with no awning or protection from the weather.</br></br>

If it is 40 degrees and raining, and if you want your call, you are going to stand in line for an hour or two to make your call. Why an hour or two? Do the math 18 phones, 15 minutes each, 1,200 inmates. Even though all 1,200 inmates are never on the yard together, the revolving phone line is.</br></br>

So, 72 inmates per hour is the rate on the phone. Now if there are 600 inmates on the yard, and only half (300) want to use the phone, then you may stand in line three to four hours to make your 15 minutes collect call. In the rain in the cold, if there is no unexpected early yard recall.</br></br>

And right now, because of the restrictions placed on us due to the unpreparedness of the prison, we are only getting a shot at yard where the phones are every three to four days and only for an hour or two at a time. Now you have people cutting and bullying their way into line, wow prison is just like free society.</br></br>

And allow me to detail what an actual call sounds like with elderly parent. You dial the number using Global Tel phone monopoly, the phone tells the person on the other end, they are receiving a call from an inmate in the CDCR. Even though they already know what that because they had to create an account to get the collect call in the first place. It's just interrupting your call.</br></br>

Hello. hello. Delay. Yes what. Hello, are you there. What e you there. Yes hello, How are you doing. Good. That's good. How is mom doing and how is her health. Well I got some bad- recorder message; "You are talking to an inmate from the California Department of Corrections, Soledad, California. You and your caller are being recorded."</br></br> 

All of that was stated at the beginning of the call, but now interrupting and eating up more of your phone call. Bad what is she alright. Oh yeah she is doing fine, I was just going to say I got a bad crack in my windshield. Now you are already more than half through you treasured phone call.</br></br> 

Hey did you get a chance to order my quarterly- recorder message; "You are talking to an inmate from the California Department of Corrections, Soledad, California. You and your caller are being recorded." What were you saying now before the recording. I was asking if you had a chance to order my- recording: "You have 60 seconds left on your phone call," ten seconds later the phone automatically cuts off.</br></br>

It maybe days or weeks before you get the chance to go through that gain. Now imagine standing in the rain for two hours only to have no one answer right then. Because the only time of day that you can call, the person you are calling is at work.</br></br> 

I can see, at a glance, this can sound like whining. And very frequently you hear, "well you should of thought of that before you went to prison." </br></br>

Undoubtedly some of you are obnoxiously nodding your head yes because you agree. The problem with this thinking is this; the law is the law whether you are incarcerated or not. It is against the law to rob someone on the street and it is against the law to rob someone in prison.</br></br> 

If the objective of CDCR is to correct one's behavior, and you agree with that idea, then you can't say, "I as a tax paying citizen want these criminals locked up for breaking the law, because I am a God-fearing law-abiding citizen."</br></br>

And then say, "now that you are in jail, criminal, I support the idea of having correctional staff break the law whenever they feel like it and show no example of human decency, because you're in jail and that's what you get". Kind of smells like hypocrisy.</br></br>

The solution</br></br>

The CCPOA (California Correctional Peace Officers Association), the prison guards union, would have the tax payer believe, that on any given day, that the only thing stopping us fire breathing, unredeemable, murdering, raping, child eating monsters from spilling onto the street like a scene from any zombie movie, and devouring the unsuspecting public, is them, the correctional officer.</br></br>

Once they claimed they "walk the toughest beat". A good portion of them don't appear to walk any kind of beat. Before I continue an ugly, but accurate description of guards, make no mistake, prisons are here for a reason.</br></br>

They are full of bad people. The guards have a job to do, most of them do it. Most are respectful.</br></br>

But because of their union, the ones like the ones I am about to describe continue to collect a check and their attitudes, racism, poor work, and social ethics destroy morale for staff and inmates alike. Considering the current climate regarding race and lack of public trust towards government, these individuals actually do a great deal of damage and they perpetuate that goes both ways between cop and criminal.</br></br>

The solution to almost everything wrong in prison is cameras, cameras, cameras. The California prison system, and all that it relates to it has become what it has become because the CCPOA always has and still does absolutely control the narrative regarding this world behind the wall.</br></br> 

I'm certain, the taxpayer, no matter which side of the political aisle they are on, republican, democrat, tough on crime, lock them all up, let them all go, and especially during the current state of the economy, would not stand for what actually goes on in here. If they could see how their tax money is wasted.</br></br>

It is super bowl Sunday. People on the streets are dying, starving, homeless, jobless, etc. All of the kids impacted by this virus, in regard to school will be forever be impacted by this anomaly. Their ability to get higher education, health care, a home, a family, is very uncertain.</br></br> 

So it's a stinging insult in my book, to see a morbidly obese, disrespectful prison guard, lean back in his chair, about to break it, sweating from sitting, stuffing his face, and watching the super bowl. While pulling a double because they manipulate the overtime.</br></br>

I suspect that if the taxpayer could go online and look at a live feed of any prison, at any time and anywhere, inside that prison via cameras, the face of California's prison system would change so fast it would be overwhelming. Accountability.</br></br>

The laws, our sentencing, the amount of prisons in the state are all the result of a public that does not know that they need to know. The handling of and the spread of the COVID-19 virus inside the prisons would all be impacted with cameras. A picture is worth 1,000 words.</br></br> 

The public owns and pays for these prisons. Then pay these guards to do a job. But what kind of return are tax payers getting for their money? None.</br></br>

I envision a website that taxpayers would log onto, that would be similar to watching CBSs Big Brother reality show. And no matter the individual's motives for viewing the goings on inside of a prison. I.e., want to prove/disprove that guards are giving the taxpayer their money's worth, want to see what inmates are doing to be rehabilitated, how they are spending their time.</br></br> 

When riots or staff misconduct is alleged, bingo, high definition proof one way or another. Cameras need to provide the public with full coverage.</br></br>

I express this because for example there may be one or two cameras on any given yard, but all the staff know exactly what the cameras coverage is. So, they sit on their table, or bench, or chair that they do their eating, napping, etc. out of the sweep of the camera. Or they allow the cameras to become dirty so that the footage is obscured.</br></br> 

My entire term I have wished they would wire these prisons up.</br></br>

Footage of guard's misdeeds is the reason they scoff at cell phones in the hands of inmates. The news classically repeats the mantra that inmates use the cell phones to carry out nefarious criminal plots from behind bars. Some may.</br></br> 

I used the one I had that a cop brought in, to talk to my aging parents, play games, get cute pictures of baby animals, and educate myself in different matters.</br></br>

But the thing that absolutely horrifies these guards is when events like a riot occur and the prison tells the media their heroic version of the event, and then some inmate sends the same media video footage of said riot and it shows the guards standing by watching. 

The reason the penalty for a guard bringing in a phone is only a misdemeanor, is because so many of them are bringing them in. Of course, when a guard can buy a cheap 60-dollar cell phone and sale it to an inmate for 1,500 dollars, not a bad investment, eh.</br></br>

The prison also slanders inmates' families by claiming all these phones are being introduced into the prisons by having the female family member secrete the phone in an orifice to smuggle it in during visits. Funny thing though, due to the coronavirus there have been no visits in CDCR since March 2020, but there are still ample drugs and phones everywhere. I wonder where they are coming from?</br></br> 

Need cameras.</br></br>

The questionnaire I received from you was premised on causing prison reform. It is psychologically encouraging to believe that someone cares. I could and happily would elaborate on anything I have touched on or any other questions you have. It's unfortunate that human life is still a commodity.</br></br> 

Slavery is still alive and well.</br></br>

Even after 23 years in here, I still don't stereotype the guards as most of them do us. And I still absolutely believe that cameras would solve everything that is wrong with these prisons. Not clips used for propaganda from some riot in 1989. With technology advancing the way it is, cameras are getting smaller, cheaper, clearer.</br></br> 

If the guards have nothing to hide, "what are they worried about the cameras for?"</br></br>

Veteran music program</br></br>

I mentioned at the beginning of my talk about life inside during the COVID crisis. That there was some positive programming that I am involved in; some of which I actually created. There are two things intertwined. We inmates are trying to start a first of its kind veterans program on my facility, CTF North B facility. And I was in the US army so I'm a vet, and two I am the B Facility Veterans band coordinator.</br></br>

Both of these projects had just got in the air and we were shut down by COVID. Even worse than COVID though, there existed and still exists that same negative, anti-inmate/anti-positive programming attitude at this prison. Their COVID issue just made it easier to slow down our progress while having something to hide behind.</br></br> 

I have included a mission statement for the veterans program and a couple of contacts.</br></br>

In all of this, there is one staff member, he is worth his weight in gold. His son was an Army Ranger and died of leukemia. He supports us 1,000 percent. A lot of staff despise him and call him a "hug-a-thug" cop because he advocates for us.</br></br>

To put it in plain English, we need outside support to be involved and/or support what we're doing. So the whole anti-positive programming crowd here has no room to operate. They do not want to be exposed as having that attitude. They exist quietly and are subversive.</br></br> 

If someone like UC Irvine, or someone within its network is involved bringing positive attention to what we are doing, the aforementioned group will just have to scurry away. Think abusive parents when they think someone is watching.</br></br>

So, my request is for you to help me network and to assist me in getting our fledgling band program off the guard. I have been locked up for 23 years. I taught myself to play guitar in prison and play a pretty mean Stevie Ray Vaughn. I write songs and have been recorded in prison.</br></br>

When I arrived here at CTF in 2018, they had no band program. They had some damaged, old junky music equipment in what was the shower room for the prison gym.</br></br>

I commandeered the 15 x 40-foot room to begin its transition into the B Facility Veterans Band Program. My father donated 700 dollars worth of paint and supplies. And no sooner had I painted the room red, white, and blue, all program was shut down because of the coronavirus.</br></br>

Staff have told us they think both the band program and the Vet program are stupid. What do you say to that? Given the known benefits of the rehabilitative value of music and the arts.</br></br> 

We intend to merger the benefits of learning to play an instrument and or coexisting in a band with the rehabilitative needs of the incarcerated inmates that are also Veterans suffering from PTSD.</br></br>

The state will pay for nothing. Budget constraints.</br></br>

I am free and clear to acquire all the donations I want. I'll make this part very brief and if anyone is interested in helping, they can write me for more specifics. In short, including sound proofing for a 15 x 40 x 12 foot gym shower room with foam rubber acoustic treatment tiles.</br></br>

I need to completely outfit this room for music learning and playing. Plus the sound reinforcement for playing live outdoor venues to a crowd of 200 to 300 inmates and staff, i.e. mixing console, speakers, mics, etc.</br></br>

We need everything literally. Music cords, stands, all instruments, racks, cases, amplifiers, electric guitars, bass guitars speakers, etc. Imagine Taylor Swift building her studio here, then leaving.</br></br>

We need all the help we can get. The form letter you sent premised the whole thing on the hopes of causing prison reform. We are here trying to do the same thing.</br></br> 

I am hoping with some networking, we can find people/companies willing to donate the equipment we need so we can get this music program going. And have the support/exposure we need so that the anti-inmate crowd here will either have to support us or just keep quiet.</br></br>

The main writing here, pages one through five are in response to the COVID Behind Bars/PrisonPandemic questionnaire you sent. That you said you would post anonymously on UC Irvine's website. The separate, but included letter/info about the Veterans Band Program and the Veterans program as a whole, that we're trying to build here, is for your consumption and maybe you can advise me on how to continue.</br></br>

Sincerely,</br></br>

PS. Please make sure the pandemic portion of this writing is in fact posted anonymously. The retaliation for me writing it would be swift.</br></br>

Veterans program mission statement</br></br>

On behalf of the Veterans at the Correctional Training Facility (CTF), Soledad, facility B, I hope that this is letter finds yourself doing well. I am writing to you for a couple of reasons. All of which are positive and have the potential to become something amazing and truly beneficial for incarcerated veterans.</br></br>

Beginning in June of 2019, discussions of making facility B at CTF a veterans only yard began. The reason for such a facility is that the needs of veterans have long been ignored. Especially when it comes to filing for and receiving the benefits which Veterans are entitled to.</br></br> 

In the past, and even still, it has been next to impossible to get the medical examinations that are required by the Veterans Administration (VA).</br></br> 

Often the excuse was that the Veterans are too spread out and it is too difficult for the VA to get to them all. This program would eliminate that by creating one centralized location of Veterans. There are currently approximately 6,900 Veterans who are incarcerated and CTF facility B would become the central hub for those who wish to participate in and qualify for the program.</br></br>

Another benefit for such a facility is that it provides an environment that fosters true rehabilitation, while focusing on the unique needs of veterans. It will also provide a place where the community is joined together with a brotherhood of honor, courage, and commitment. And a loyalty to each other that cannot be replicated or imitated.</br></br> 

The veterans here have already established the following mission statement for themselves:</br></br> 

"We are committed to working as a team in order to help each other overcome the challenges of life and strive for self- improvement and a successful rehabilitation. We are dedicated to working hard at giving back to the communities which we have taken so much from. We stand firm on the proud military traditions of honor, courage, and commitment, and hold each other to the highest of standards."</br></br>

The staff at facility B (from Warden Koenig, down to the housing officers) have expressed their support for this program. And so have some organizations from the outside community, such as Veterans Healing Veterans from the Inside Out (VHV), the Veterans Transition Center of Monterey County, the Defense Language Institute, the Post Naval Graduate School, and Congressman Panetta's office.</br></br> 

From what I have been told, Sacramento has been presented with the idea and are supportive of it as well.</br></br>


Not only am I writing this letter to you to present the idea to you, but I am seeking your support and any services/assistance for it as well. We have hit a bit of a speed bump with the COVID-19 pandemic and have lost much of our momentum, but are continuing to work hard in order to see this come true.</br></br> 

We are committed to our fellow veterans and will never give up on trying to help them make their time in prison as positive as possible.</br></br> 

When this program becomes a reality, it will be the first of its kind in the nation and will be the template that many others will follow. If you are willing to support and/or lend any assistance with a program like this, please reach out to not only us but the following individuals as well.</br></br>

Veteranshealingveterans.org</br></br>

I look forward to hearing back from you on this matter and hopefully working with you in the future on what is shaping up to be a monumental step forward. Not only for Veterans and CDCR but for the state of California as it becomes the model for change.
