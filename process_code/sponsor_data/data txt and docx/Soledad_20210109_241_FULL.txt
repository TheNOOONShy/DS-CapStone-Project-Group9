This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Soledad.</br></br>

December 2, 2020</br></br>

Normally I would type you this letter of great importance. My typewriter recently broke, so this will have to do. I don’t fear CDCR and I’m not one to speak anonymously. So let me share with all of you life behind these walls during COVID-19 epidemic.</br></br>

I am on my 28th year of incarceration in prison, of a life sentence having been wrongly and unjustly convicted out of Santa Clara County. I am 57 years young, single, and a father of adult children. I have very little family and friends left in my corner, but enough love and support from them to keep me strong, alive, and filled with hope. It hasn’t been easy, but I’m a survivor and I refuse to give up hope or fighting for truth and justice.</br></br>

Many people here in prison have no family, friends, or support from out in the free world and that alone is or can be a death sentence. People should never give up on or turn their backs on their loved ones simply because they come to prison and especially during this crisis.</br></br> 

It’s not always about money, packages, or material things. For a simple card or letter can do wonders to boost a convict's mental support and well being. So, for those of you who have walked in these shoes, it's never to late to correct this.</br></br>

I arrived here to Soledad North back in 2017, and early on in this year of 2020 many people did not take this COVID-19 epidemic too seriously. I know I didn’t. But I work here in PIA, textiles, and in March 2020 we were given the task of making, or sewing, face masks for state employees and prisoners. We made about 250,000. Then with the daily news updates is when I, and others started taking this seriously.</br></br> 

Even more so for me when I learned my nephew had become infected with COVID-19. I’m told he is doing well and is stable. But many people still to this day are not taking this seriously.</br></br>

Here at Soledad prison, north yard, a new COVID-19 program was put into affect in which they began feeding us in our cells. And the only prisoners eating in the prison dining halls were certain workers, and only in the morning, and it was one person per table. The level one prisoners housed in the dorm were fed in the dining hall at both breakfast and dinner time.</br></br> 

The dorm holds about 200 prisoners and that number was cut in half due to the COVID-19 social distancing order. And even more so, for at one point I counted 36 prisoners housed in the north yard dorm.</br></br>

Then on April 18, 2020, all the remaining prisoners in the north yard dorm were transferred to the CTF South facility, which is a level one facility. This is so that the north yard dorm could be used as a COVID-19 quarantine housing area. And at the same time half of Rainer Hall, B-side was cleared out of all prisoners.</br></br> 

So as to use Rainer Hall, B-side for a quarantine area for possible COVID-19 positive prisoners. And as a 14-day quarantine area for prisoners transferring, have from other prisoners and prison facilities. As well as for prisoners having to leave the prison and return.</br></br>

What was upsetting about this was that so many prisoners who were situated well and living with a person they knew, liked, and were compatible with, were forced to move. And be placed in a cell with a prisoner they were strangers with, could not, or would not live with. And even in a couple of cases were forced to live with a prisoner of another race. And even though by rule interracial living is enforced by CDCR, many prisoners will not abide by that rule.</br></br>

In many other prisons I have been at, the officers will allow a prisoner to look for a person he can live with when he is told he must find a cellmate. But here only a very few officers will afford you that opportunity. And many times you end up getting stuck with a prisoner who rarely showers, is dirty, and has no priority for his cleansing.</br></br>

All prisoners that were moved, were moved to CTF North, B yard or to CTF South, level one or to other places. Many were moved Lassen Hall to try and fill up both A and B side. Here at Soledad, both, you have A-yard and B-yard. And here where I am housed, CTF North, A-yard you have Lassen Hall - A and B and Rainer Hall - A and B.</br></br>

And then across the way you have also CTF -North, B-yard and housing units “Whitney Hall - A and B” and “Shasta Hall - A and B.” Then on both yards each has a dorm living area which housed about 200 level two prisoners.</br></br>

Up until about a week ago there were only about six COVID-19 positive prisoners placed in quarantine in the dorm area. And as of about a week ago, numerous prisoners testing positive for COVID-19 were placed in both the dorm and Rainer hall- B side under quarantine. Why the separation? I have no answer.</br></br>

Here is what has angered me about the way CTF officials have handled this COVID-19 epidemic. We are at CTF North, A-yard were the only facility/yard with no COVID-19 positive prisoners/staff. And that being the case this facility should of been filled to capacity and then placed on lockdown with no intake and left alone. Then if and when a COVID-19 prisoner arose, take measures to control and treat it.</br></br>

But due to staff and medical staff negligence, on November 21, 2020, Saturday, Lassen Hall, A and B side was placed on quarantine lockdown. Due to one prisoner on B-side testing positive for COVID-19. This prisoner in question was on regular taken to medical trips outside the prison and should of been placed in either Rainer Hall or the dorm under the 14-day quarantine policy.</br></br> 

Soon after six more prisoners tested positive and were placed in quarantine before Rainer Hall and the dorm. I have counted 25 prisoners who are under COVID-19 quarantine. And it's bullshit that CTF officials have been placed a low to no regard for my safety and health or wellbeing, and nothing is being done about it.</br></br>

Today was only the second time that there have been given yard and phone access for 75 minutes. And we only got to shower every three days. We have our temperature taken daily and we are fed in our cell on paper trays. Our premade food trays are delivered to us in metal roll away carts which are delivered to the building. Always cold with small portions.</br></br>

What has angered me and many other prisoners is the prisoners who are under quarantine get yard and phone access everyday. So, prisoners are now faking symptoms. Simply to be placed under quarantine, so as to get daily yard and phone access. I just need to tell medical I have COVID-19 symptoms, and I’ll be quarantined and get daily yard and phone use.</br></br>

On November 21, 2020, Saturday, when we were placed on quarantine later that evening, we were all given the COVID-19 nose-swab test. But prior to doing the test, I witnessed two female Asian RNs sorting out all the test and they had them all on the dirty floor. With no protection to keep them free from dirt or contamination.</br></br> 

When one of the nurses heard me complaining and observing them, they then picked up the big plastic garbage bags. The test kits were in off the floor, and placed them on a table, after first placing down a medical cover sheet.</br></br>

Then since 11-21-20, we have only been given two new medical face masks, which staff receive new ones daily. Because we are prisoners shouldn’t mean we get or are shown less medical care and attention. We are still human beings and this COVID-19 disease does not discriminate. Not all officers, officials, or medical staff treat us less than human. For some do actually care and I can honestly say I care for some of them that I know very well and respect.</br></br>

I understand the separation line, but the bottom-line is we are all in this together and should go beyond all measures to lookout for, and help and try, and cure one another.</br></br>

I am saddened by the many, many lives already lost. Young and old. And my concern is more for my family, friends, and loved ones out in the free world. For not being able to be there for and with them is a heavy burden in itself. I worry for them everyday and to lose one of them due to COVID-19 would take a heavy toll on my mental well being.</br></br>

Left in my corner is my brother and a handful of friends. And not being able to visit with them is heartbreaking. And due to space limitations, I don’t see why CDCR can’t allow prisoners to receive one contact visit for every 90 days. For two hours, Saturday and Sunday, from 8:30 am to 3:30 pm.</br></br> 

Twenty-five prisoners a day for two hours comes to 75 prisoners visits, 50 for both days. And in one month, one yard, both buildings can get their contact visit. But not all prisoners receive visits and this one visit can do wonders for a prisoner.</br></br>

But with or without visitation we must all exercise a lot of understanding, patience, and use this time to build up a strong communication line. To strengthen a bond that’s being tested and challenged.</br></br>

No, I don’t feel safe simply because of how officials and medical staff have responded to and are treating this COVID-19 epidemic. In the beginning most staff were treating us prisoners like we were the ones who could infect them. When in all reality if COVID-19 entered the prison system it would be from an officer, free staff and/or medical staff being infected and spreading it to the prison population. And this was the case at CTF Central.</br></br>

I have refused yard and I refuse to use the phone simply because the COVID-19 positive prisoners are using the same phones as us, who are not infected. Yes, all the phones and sitting areas are sprayed with some type of disinfected, but there are 17 phones on the yard and they should have taped off five phones for those who are COVID-19 positive only. And this is my point of prison officials not taking this seriously.</br></br>

Right now there is no work, education, vocation, meeting groups, or programs. But if and when they do call us to go to work I will refuse if this epidemic is not under control and taken seriously. I am a programmer. I love to work.</br></br> 

I’m a lifer and in my 28 years of incarceration I can count on my hands how many days of work I was forced to miss due to being sick. And my only one disciplinary report was about 18 years ago and for me to refuse work would tarnish any positive program. But that’s how seriously I’m taking this when prison officials are not.</br></br>

I’m coping with this crisis the best I can and mentally it is a challenge, considering everything else currently on my plate. But I will survive the best I can with what is available to me. And with that I ask each and everyone of you able and willing to stand up and be a helping hand and solution and look at “everyone” as an equal and treat him or her as such. God bless.
