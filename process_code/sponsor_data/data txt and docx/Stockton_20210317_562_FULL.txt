This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Stockton.</br></br>Dear PrisonPandemic,</br></br>These people think they're immune from prosecution for murder. I got my head bashed in for questioning a doctor at SATF Corcoran State Prison by a program office worker. And after I was already having problems with my celly. Serious problems and they couldn’t move me or him. I am a cripple with a heart condition.</br></br>

I tried to prosecute and they just grabbed me up and sent me to another prison RJD Donovan, San Diego.</br></br>When I was already endorsed at SATF Corcoran, SATF is not a substance abuse treatment facility. When I first got to RJD, they failed to transfer my heart medication and I ended up at the Chula Vista Emergency Hospital. First of all, when I was brought to WASCO, a reception center, in my wheelchair, I did not know what to expect, first termer.</br></br> Never been in prison before. Never been on parole/probation or even hooked with mental health before.  Without reading my rights they put me in the MHDS, Mental Health Delivery System. And made me 1.3 grade average for not taking a test that’s a reading level of less than a fourth grader.</br></br> 

Does this letter look like that? Then when I got to SATF Corcoran they put me in a class.</br></br>Said I was illiterate and made me go to classes or else I would get discipline R and Rs called a 115 in. I could get more time if I didn’t go.</br></br> 

Back to RJD, when I got out of the hospital, they put me for a EOP yard.</br></br> 

Oh yeah, back to SATF Corcoran. It took three almost four years to get my ID straightened out and I had to do it myself.</br></br>

They could not help me. Anyways back at RJD Donovan when they put me on the EOP yard. It’s a medical yard. I yelled at an officer because officers were calling me, I don’t know them. I’d be the first one to laugh if I thought something was funny.</br></br> Heh this is prison and not to minimize something, but I just committed is what they call arson of an inhabited structure, a 451 violation. At the county jail where I was at I yelled at some officer because they were bumping my legs against the walls in my wheelchair, and they pulled me off my wheelchair.</br></br>  

And because I have a struggle, they took my wheelchair away from me and I had to crawl on the ground. And if I didn’t make it to the door, I wouldn’t get food or clean clothing.</br></br> 

Talk about abuse and neglect and no one, I mean no one would do anything about it.</br></br>I’ve been denied my education, religion, Christmas special meals. They only have Kosher and Muslim. Oh! They have a Christmas meal and Thanksgiving but that’s it, no jubilee etc.</br></br>  

And the protestors burnt down Kobe Bryant’s and families' catholic church. And soon you know the famous basketball player that him and his daughter got killed from a helicopter crash, sad.</br></br>

My CC one Corcoran falsified my SSI number. And transferred it to the Santa Maria Parole Office and not only is it not time to do that. It is not his job description. Two doctors falsified prescriptions here. Help.
