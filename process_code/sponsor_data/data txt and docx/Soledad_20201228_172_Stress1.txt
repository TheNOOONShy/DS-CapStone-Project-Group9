Hello,</br></br> 

First I’d like to thank you all for your thoughtful words of encouragement during these critical times, hard to deal with, which have befallen us all.</br></br> 

Then I’d like to jump straight into sharing my experiences in regards to how CDCR has been dealing with us and our loved ones during the COVID-19 pandemic, or how they have failed to deal with us and our loved ones during the pandemic.</br></br> 

Being in prison at any time is a dreadful thing because it's a place where each day is filled with so many uncertainties, but life during the pandemic has been a total conundrum. We’ve entered a very dark period behind these walls due to the pandemic.
