This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Susanville.</br></br>For months I was clearly negative for the virus but due to them moving us around, allowing those they knew for a fact to be COVID-19 positive to be around us and then mixing negative and positive together, I too was infected and became positive for COVID-19. I was scared, in shock, and going crazy out of my mind in my own type of way.</br></br>
IÕve seen individuals (aka inmates) fall out and the paramedics come get them Ð for a time the staff would try to say it was from the heat (which the weather wasn't hot at the time) or the person was not drinking enough fluids. But we all know you can not hide the truth for long and people were falling out due to the COVID-19 virus and being infected. The higher ups (aka the brass and the wardens are all alike) they did not care and tried their hardest to just sweep the situation(s) under the rug.</br></br>
Such foolishness mixed with craziness without care of their part. From what I've hearing both wardens are in hot water! On April 8, 2021 I finally get a chance to take the Johnson & Johnson shot so IÕve now been vaccinated. But to think about what more could have done to really prevent the outbreak of COVID-19 here if this institution was not money hungry and allowed to continuously cover whatever there is of importance here. We are so very well out of the way here and no one really takes the time to deal with issues.
