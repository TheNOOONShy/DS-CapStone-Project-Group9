This story was told by a person incarcerated at Centinela.</br></br>

Caller: In regards to COVID? Well, shit, some prisons are really going through it, you know, with this whole COVID situation. You know, they don’t tell us the numbers.</br></br>

We don’t know, we don’t get the information, we can’t tell, they’re not gonna tell us, you know, how many people have the virus right here, you know. I just know that they'll have entire buildings that have COVID, people that have it, you know, COVID.</br></br>

And then they’ll wipe out an entire building and put them all in one spot, you know. At a certain point in time, if you caught COVID-19, you were moved to this spot whether you wanted to get moved or not, you had to go you know. But, like, what was the question?</br></br>

UCI: Oh no, it was just regarding anything else that, you know, you would like people to know.</br></br>

Caller: I mean, it would be nice if we had some kind of newspaper in here, to know what was going on, on the outside, you know, or what’s going on at this facility. It would be really, you know, it would definitely help out a lot. It would put a lot of people at ease if we knew what was going on you know, and a lot of us don’t have access to.</br></br>

UCI: Hello?</br></br>

Caller: Nice to be informed here.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, yeah, cut off again.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah. It would be nice to be informed, like to not be stuck in limbo you know, to know what’s going on. In here, even out there, not everyone has a TV and everything, you have to buy that kind of stuff, you know.
