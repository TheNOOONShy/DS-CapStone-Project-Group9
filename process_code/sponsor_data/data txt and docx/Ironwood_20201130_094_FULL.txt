This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Ironwood.</br></br>

To whom this may concern,</br></br>

I am writing to inform you of how CDCR/Ironwood has responded to COVID-19 and its protective policies. I have been housed at Ironwood since my transfer from [redacted]. An attempt to creating a socially distanced environment, and even up to present, Ironwood's efforts to provide a healthy and safe domain have been mediocre and superficial at best.</br></br>

From the beginning this compliance with COVID-19 policy has been dictated by Ironwood's manager and supervisors who are ultimately displaying a nonchalance toward enforcing these policies and continuing to enhance the conditions of this facility where they can.</br></br>

Instead of being genuinely concerned with building a safe and healthy environment, every request toward that end has been met with resistance, excuses, and an almost indifference to the legitimacy of how it will benefit and effect inmates and staff alike. From our perspective, Ironwood has only sought out ways in which they might deprive us of the few privileges that our circumstances allow, and this is orchestrated by supervisors under the guise of "policy".</br></br>

Examples of this abuse: Several months ago, inmates were restricted to the use of every other phone to create social distance, this "policy" was put in place rather than installing partitions. Myself and others submitted complaints on this deprivation and how not being able to communicate effectively with family etc. during this pandemic is causing irreparable damage to the mental and physical health of those involved. My claim was denied, but a month or so later maintenance installed partitions.</br></br> 

Then a new policy was put out citing that all phones would now be available for use, but that 15 minutes between usage would be occupied for cleaning. This because cell block 64 "must sit for 10 minutes" to be effective. This action is obviously an abuse of policy and intended to mock our complaints since nothing was actually intended to provide more access to phones. Under both "policies" there is approximately the same provisions, 160 sign up availabilities for 200 inmates, and this does not consider calls that are missed due to testing, training, or (now) conflict in building meals. I filed a complaint on this policy.</br></br> 

Again, instead of making an effort to compensate for the lack of phone availability and sanitation procedures, Ironwood supervisors have demonstrated that they do not care. Secondly, supervisors and management are condoning a measure of group punishment in confiscation and/or suspending inmate privileges where some can be seen not complying with mask or social distance protocol. Phones have been disinfected, recreation equipment confiscated, and canteen closed as a form of punishment for what amounts to a sporadic defiance perpetrated by a few individuals.</br></br>

In one instance I approached two sergeants and respectfully asked why they were enabling group punishment tactics instead of using the rules violation process to directly address those in non-compliance. I also indicated that they were intentionally inciting tension and stress in an already difficult time. Both sergeants said, "I can do what I want. Write me up."</br></br>

Additionally, quarterly packages are often taking months to be issued, have been damaged and returned without notification or verification and have been issued to the wrong person. We are often relying on hygiene and cleaning products that our families are purchasing to benefit us during this pandemic, and not receiving them in a timely fashion, or at all due to the carelessness of staff, is in many ways disallowing us the ability to keep ourselves clean and safe. Ironwood is not issuing an adequate supply of cleaners or necessary rags, toilet scrubbers or gloves for cell maintenance so we are left to fend for ourselves.</br></br>

It should be noted that without visits, regular access to phones, religious services, self-help groups and other avenues of communication and interaction with family and positive peers, inmates are experiencing greater levels of anxiety, depression, and other mental health concerns that this facility is unequipped to address and treat properly.</br></br> 

CDCR/Ironwood is not considering, or caring about, the fact that treatment of inhumane behavior and neglect is causing a significant increase in the mental health population and that these acquired disorders severely affect the immune system and one's ability combat COVID.</br></br>

I have been reinstated on mental health treatment since early [redacted], and my experiences with Ironwood's staff and mental health personnel has been more than counter effective and discouraging than anything. Per CDCR policy I should've been transferred within 21 days of mental health placement, but here I sit 7 months later, with no significantly effective treatment, and my endorsement expired.</br></br> 

I have a long history of mental health treatment for anxiety, panic attacks, depression, and nightmares, related to long term sexual abuse and PTSD, and though it's obvious that this situation has contributed to the resurgence of those symptoms, Ironwood has not considered it necessary to approve me for transfer where I can receive adequate treatment. I have submitted a complaint on this issue and it has been denied, appealed to a higher level.</br></br>

Staff misconduct related to non-compliance of social distancing and donning a mask is a matter that has existed and been addressed from the onset of this pandemic. Until about a week ago, Ironwood was still using meals in the dining hall and every day we were being exposed to the staff congregating around or sitting on the dining tables, wearing no mask or gloves while conversing over the table, and then instructed to sit and eat at those same tables. When respectfully asked to not sit on the table tops or put their feet on the seats and to have put on their masks and or gloves, we have been disregarded and/or sneered at like we don't matter. Many staff conveniently have something covering their names so we can't issue a complaint. Those we have issued complaints on, from what is recognized, are not being reprimanded in a way to establish intolerance.</br></br>

Subsequently staff are still disregarding policy, often clustered in groups and talking with their mask on their chin, even in the buildings during mealtimes where exposure is more significant. The severity of the affront is in the fact that sergeants and lieutenants are often present when this is occurring. Even with meals being issued in same buildings now staff are still behaving the same and what makes this more troubling is that tables, benches, and other high touch surfaces are not being disinfected afterwards or prior to evening program release. There really is so much, but I want to get this out. I will eventually call the hotline, and I will also write more in hope that together we will prevail in the advocacy of unified compliance and preventing the spread of this deadly virus.</br></br>

I cannot claim that my efforts have been effective, but I am at least attempting to lift my voice in this cause and the demand that CDCR staff be held accountable for their indifference and or blatant respect for human life, our life. My next step is to bring accountability to CDCR, Ironwood management supervisors.</br></br>

All the best.
