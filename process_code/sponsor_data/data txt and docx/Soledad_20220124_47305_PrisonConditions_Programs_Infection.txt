This story was told by a person incarcerated at Soledad.</br></br>

UCI: What has the COVID situation been like at your faculty?</br></br>

Caller: Right now, it’s gotten better. Last year was like our worst year. There's only like three confirmed cases out of a population of about 2,000 people.</br></br>

UCI: Well, that’s good to hear.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, that’s just one facility though. There's multiple facilities. There's three other facilities. So, the number one thing is always going to be, they got to single cell the place if they want to keep COVID down, you know, while it’s active.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>

Caller: 'Cause 92 percent of the population at this facility is vaccinated, but the problem that is going on is they just don’t get it.</br></br>

You had a major outbreak. We had like 21 people or really, I think it was higher than 21 people die at one facility. And then the prison probably 30 people died and they had like hundreds of people with COVID. And they move them around the building.</br></br>

They call themselves trying to isolate, but you know, there is an incubation period. So a guy will leave one building and they isolate him in another building and then they have an outbreak there. Then they’re moving people around and they're transferring people.</br></br>

And so now, it's come to the point where they do post-transfer isolation, but they shouldn’t be bringing anybody in for a couple of months. Whenever they have outbreaks - but they give us a better program. Last year we were locked in our cells. Now what they are doing is they're running programs by buildings.</br></br>

So like you program with your whole building and then like when they have, we have this thing called day room. So that's where you get your shower and then they have a couple of phones inside the building. </br></br>

You get a, they do half, they do one side. So half of the inmates in the building that holds like 250 people come out. So they'll have like 125 people, but they're spread out 'cause only half the building is out. And then they're allowing some people to go to work.</br></br>

They got like, they call it a critical workers list. And so that helps. There's like a couple of other little things. I mean, they gave us a - Mount Tamalpais College of San Quentin gave us a care package, which was nice.</br></br>

And then we were allowed to get COVID packages, which you actually paid for but they allowed you to get an extra package. But COVID proved something with the vendors. They were all shell-shocked 'cause canteen couldn’t handle it. They couldn’t handle the orders.</br></br>

So when you put in an order, say you put in an order of $240 to go to canteen, you’d only get like $130 worth of stuff and it creates another problem. So every month everybody is trying to go $240 'cause they don’t know when they are gonna go to canteen. So that is one of the things.</br></br>

And then the package companies, they got like 10 of them. They’re all private corporations you people or you can pay to have stuff shipped in to you. They can’t handle the orders. Sometimes they leave out like 10 of your items.
