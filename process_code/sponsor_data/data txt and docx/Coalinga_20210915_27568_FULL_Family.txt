This story was told by a person incarcerated at Coalinga State Hospital.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, I’m calling from Coalinga State Hospital, and I’d like you guys to check into their very, very restrictive visiting procedures and policies. Basically, since we can’t have home – since we can’t have visitors, what they do is they supply us a little tablet. And we can – they pay for us to be able to, whatever it is, Skype or whatever it is, to visit with our family.</br></br>

But this is the restriction, it’s only one person and only one person we can visit, okay? Well, I’m personally am married. Here at Coalinga State Hospital, there’s a few same-sex legally married couples, okay? And we have joint family and friends that are our support system.</br></br>

But yet, we can only visit one. I can only visit either with my sister or my sister’s husband, okay? Or my cousin or my cousin’s husband. My husband can only visit with one person. So how can we have a support system?</br></br> 

Number two, what if our parents were still alive? And we can’t visit our parents? We can’t – what if some of us around here have four or five kids or grandkids? And we can’t visit with them all at once, you know?</br></br>

And then, the staffer sitting there while we’re visiting. You know, it’s just very un-therapeutic, very restrictive, and to me, very mean, very malicious. And, you know, I mean, these people here, they don’t take anything into consideration other than security, security, security, security, security.</br></br>

But their - their visiting regulations here for during the pandemic, it’s hard enough as it is being locked up in this hospital. It’s hard enough to be able to do all the court stuff that we have to go through. It’s hard enough with the restrictive evilness that DSH is. And then we can’t even have a proper visit? You know, I mean, this is just baloney, straight baloney.</br></br> 

I’d really like you guys to check into the visiting procedures here and how it’s just demeaning, demoralizing, and extremely un-therapeutic for people in treatment. And you guys should actually be open before 5:00. Thank you.
