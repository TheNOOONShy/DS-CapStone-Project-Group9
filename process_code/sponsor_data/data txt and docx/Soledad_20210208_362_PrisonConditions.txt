This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Soledad.</br></br>

On December 27, 2020, a good friend of mine died. On December 31, 2020, I went to meet up with the kitchen officer to talk to him about my concerns on how the administrator was handling the COVID-19 pandemic by violating several health and safety codes. I asked the officer for information on pertaining to the side effect of once you had COVID-19.</br></br>The officer didn’t provide any information that could settle my nerves but told me that if I don’t show up for work I’ll get a 115 and mess up my chance at the parole board meeting. I will leave it at that for now but if you need more inside information please feel free to write and ask. And by the way, I no longer work in the kitchen, I took a stand! So if I get a 115-disciplinary action- then I’ll explain it at board when that time comes. Once again, thank you.</br></br>Respectfully.
