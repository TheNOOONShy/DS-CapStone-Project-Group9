To whom who may be interested</br></br>

I am an inmate in California State Prison and as of now is in good health. I would like to thank you for concerned with the well being of inmates as well as my health. It's always nice to hear from someone who care.</br></br>

About my time here.</br></br>

I am now 23 and is now working on my fourth year being incarcerated in California systems. As a person, I wouldn't expect for those that have never been to know how it is here, nor what it feel like.</br></br>

My time here has been a hidden war with me versus a mental aspect. Without explaining, just the thought of prison is deeply depressing, not to mention not having people in your corner. I finally come to terms it could always be worth something.</br></br>

It's not all bad, at least someone care.</br></br>

I think it's not all bad just because someone care. Talking and getting an understanding on how a prison used to be. On a scale with how it is, today shows a big turnaround, or the start of one.</br></br>

Hearing how it was then is exactly what I thought it was today. I could have adjusted to fit in/stay, but all in all I'm glad it is not as dangerous as it was. I blew my power out for a weekend and almost lost my mind.</br></br>

Saying that I have to say, whoever thought it was cool giving inmates televisions should have won a Nobel Peace Prize! We should be able to get one or two more complaints. My fan, coplayer, and TV take up all three available slots. So it's kinda mandatory I get a cellie with a hotpot. See the problems with being a man?</br></br>

The programs suck, mostly just this prison.</br></br>

This being my first year in prison I have no comparison. Luckily I made it right before the pandemic hit so I got a sneak peak of program. Yard and dayroom be at the same time.</br></br>

Those two hours and 30 minutes of leg stretching, conversing, and/or fam conversations on the phone was nice. I liked using the phone then heading outside once done.</br></br>

It's understandable that only one level can come out at a time, it's easier workout time, it's kind of a lot of us. My time on regular program is over. Bye bye cafe.</br></br>

It's been bad since quarantine came.</br></br>

Since we have been on quarantine, things seem to get worse. First the visits stopped. One of the best things of being here is the way everybody's face would light up once they see you. Can go a long way with that alone.</br></br>

The second thing was the yard change. The only thing good that came from one full building at yard, other than our heath, was finding other people to help pass the time with.</br></br>

Shortly after that we were given mask to wear. Which made no sense given the situation. It was understandable until things got out of hand. With dayroom leaving our possession we had nothing.</br></br>

They kick us while we were down.</br></br>

It's bad we have nothing but a shower and phone call, but it's fuel to a fire when we get wrote up for not wearing a mask. The reader should be aware we are inmates being held against our will in these closed environments and all we wanna do is go home.</br></br>

With it being three months off your good credit date, the peace officer are issuing write ups for not wearing mask. So why weren't the correction officers wearing mask? We're technically already in quarantine while they infest us.</br></br>

If we are here rehabilitating, then why are we forced to take abrasive action to do so? To be heard? For peace officers and correctional officers to bring peace and correction?</br></br>

Why must we argue angrily, fuss, and have 602 wars for our correction and peace? If they were here for correction they wouldn't write us up for minor things like speaking to another cell while we come out for showers. They would correct us.</br></br>

We get write ups for napping a little too long at count time. Pushing our freedom from us a quarter year when all that was needed was a light tap on the cell door. We get write ups for delaying a peace officer from reading a memo posted on the wall while being out for a shower.</br></br>

If not now then when is the right time to read it? Phone calls? Officers be short on staff two buildings away and yet we get shorted on our phone calls that we only get every other day.</br></br>

With our block having all the staff needed how are we getting shorted? Who was that, that decided we should only get video visits once a month while our regular visits are every weekend?</br></br>

Does that person or people believe seeing your loved ones less during a time like this help us rehabilitate better? I apologize for not making the passage shorter or in its own paragraph with why it's heading/leading through.</br></br>

I would like to know if it's true.</br></br>

Last year a memo was passed stating everyone that didn't get a write up the last few weeks get 12 weeks granted towards our early release date. Is that all a worldwide crisis is worth? Not my point.</br></br>

In this country things are not single handedly ruled. They need boards, congress. What's known as politicking, where there are two sides of the argument. This case specific is I speak of is the 1,170 if I'm not mistaken. If I am please excuse me.</br></br>

This motion gets all enhancements taken off any case. If I'm wrong then for sure it takes off gang and gun enhancements. Which is what seem like the only enhancements here.</br></br>

If the prosecutors are here to decide if we did the crime or not and attorneys are here to defend us, then why are there problems with releasing unneeded extensions on the outrageous and inhumane times we are being sentenced to? If not 1,170 then 1,070.</br></br>

You asked and here's the answer.</br></br>

It's been disappointing during these times, poorly protected. My safety doesn't seem to bother me as much as how I'm being treated. It was expected limitation were to come caused by the pandemic, but it's just lazy on the video visits and un-understood.</br></br>

The only coming to terms I have been doing during these times is the people here and who pledge to protect only seem to care about getting paid to keep us here. Is it true?</br></br>

I would like to first apologize for waiting so long to reply. I guess I had to digest the question first. Secondly, I would like to thank you for caring.</br></br>

Thank you to PrisonPandemic as well as the PrisonPandemic project.
