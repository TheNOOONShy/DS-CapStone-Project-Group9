<em>This story was told by a person incarcerated at Larry D. Smith Correctional Facility.</br></br></em>

UCI: How has the COVID situation been like at your facility?</br></br>

Caller: Well, it's been sputtering along. They just recently stated that they would force those who are going to take the COVID test, and that prompted some of the people who were reluctant to, you know, take the test. But, there's still quite a few persons who refuse.</br></br>

UCI: And how has the vaccination situation been like at your facility?</br></br>

Caller: How has it been like?</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, like, the vaccination process?</br></br>

Caller: It's been going slowly. But, you know, as I was saying earlier, they, you know, offered to us. And I just recently completed mine. And so, there is quite a few who refused to take it for some reason or another.</br></br> 

[Unintelligible], you know, it's due in part because they feel that they don't take the test while being here then, you know, they'll stay in the County that much longer and, you know, that state, you know, more hesitant about infecting them.</br></br> 

But, like my celly, my celly hasn't taken his test. And, you know, that really concerns considering that, you know, I've taken mine.</br></br>

UCI: Oh, okay. So, you've had both vaccines?</br></br>

Caller: Yes, taken â€“ did you say did I take both tests?</br></br>

UCI: No, the vaccination, like the vaccine, the shot?</br></br>

Caller: Yes, I've taken both of mine. Both Pfizer.</br></br>

UCI: Oh, okay, good. That's good. And how has that situation been like at the facility where you're currently at? How's the process?</br></br>

Caller: Say that question again for me, please?</br></br>

UCI: So, how's the vaccination process being handled at your facility? Like, the vaccine?</br></br>

Caller: The process going?</br></br>

UCI: Yes.</br></br>

Caller: It's going. More of the individuals who were hesitant about taking the test, one, they had got word from staff from one of the nurses they would be forced to take the test if they went up state and for them to go ahead and start taking it. But, again, you know, there's quite a few individuals who are still reluctant to get it such as my celly. My celly hasn't taken it either.</br></br> 

And, you know, he [unintelligible] himself, you know, like 23 hours a day. And so, you know, that concerns me a little bit.
