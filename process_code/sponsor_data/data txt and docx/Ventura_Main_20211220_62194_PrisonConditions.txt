This story was told by a person incarcerated at Ventura County Main Jail.</br></br> 

Caller: The deputies are all walking around with their masks covering their mouth, but they don’t cover their nose.</br></br> 

And the only– the only place we get hand sanitizer is if we go through the tunnel to the court side. They don’t have any han– hand sanitizer for us here, although you can get antibacterial soap through the commissary. But of course, you have to spend your own money for all this commissary stuff.</br></br> 

So, my brother has to put money in my account, and then I have to fill out a Scantron. And then, they– they bring me my stuff. So I’ve– I’ve bought a lot of stamps and envelopes. And I’m sending you postcards, with artwork on it, from other inmates.</br></br> 

And I'm sort of in control of everything because they don’t really care and they’re in here. We’re all kind of in here for the long haul right now. We’re probably gonna be in here through at least [redacted].</br></br> 

Most of us– because there’s one gentleman– he’s been waiting for a placement in a– in like a sober house. But there’s– I don’t know. Apparently, there’s a very few openings for these sober houses right now.</br></br> 

UCI: Yeah. I was gonna ask how has the court system been like with the pandemic?</br></br> 

Caller: You know, it’s– it’s really crazy because it’s all done on Zoom. And we go into these things. They call them, “Condos.” But, it’s just a room with a bench and then there’s a computer screen. And then, you see who you’re gonna talk to—like my public defender.</br></br> 

But then they have like a Spanish interpreter ‘cause there’s a lot of Latino men in here, of course, ‘cause we’re in California. And, so they have an interpreter. But people pop in and pop out and they– someone’s in– someone’s seems to be in control of who comes on the screen. So sometimes, if you’re talking, you’ll be on the screen or the judge will be on the screen.</br></br> 

And then, he asks you, “Oh, who’s in Condo [redacted],” and “What’s your name?” And– and then you know, “who’s”—. And then, my public defender has someone fill in for her ‘cause they have to be in court. But, she– she Zooms me from home.</br></br> 

And sometimes, people Zoom and they’ve got the background is like, you know, a beach scene with a palm tree. Or they blur the background ‘cause they’re at home and sometimes, you know, a family member or a roommate will– will walk behind them and go in the bathroom or something. I don’t know.</br></br> 

It’s very very strange.
