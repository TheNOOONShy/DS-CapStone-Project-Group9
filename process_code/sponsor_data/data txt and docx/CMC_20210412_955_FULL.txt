Hello UCI,</br></br>


I received the thank you card and I wanted to say thank you for posting my story on your website. Things are getting better here for us. More time out of the dorm to enjoy the sunlight, more interaction with more fellow inmates, in-person visiting is about to start this weekend, and education classes at a limited capacity.</br></br>


I am staying busy doing correspondent self-help courses like Getting Out by Going In and Success Stories. And being an inside organizer to get people to support Assembly Bill 1509 that will eliminate excessive gun enhancements. I am just interacting with society, trying to build strong connections. I commend you on the positive work that you are doing for people that are incarcerated. Stay safe and keep doing good work. I look forward to sharing my stories with you.</br></br>


Thank you!</br></br>
