I would be happy to share my story. I've also passed the information to a few others that had a story to share, so I hope for a good turnout. So I'll begin, it's February 23, 2021, we have been on this lockdown for nearly a year. March of 2020 was the month the virus first arrived at CMC according to the prison staff. I along with many others had gotten sick around December of 2019.</br></br>

There was no testing at that time, so the flu-like symptoms that I felt, I thought were normal, other than why I couldn't taste anything? Once the symptoms were being broadcasted on the news, I finally understood this was no ordinary flu. I didn't mention this to my family, so not to worry them.</br></br>

By April, we no longer had any program, visits were shut down first, and everything else followed. The prison had been turned on its head. The staff couldn't figure out what to do, nor do I feel that they really saw the seriousness of what was happening.
