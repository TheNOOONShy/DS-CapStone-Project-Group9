PrisonPandemic,</br></br>


It is nice to know there are people out there that care about our safety and health. Well all of my cell mates got infected. My friends in other buildings got really sick and I myself got sick, but being a prisoner they only give you enough attention so they won’t get in trouble.</br></br>


There is no such thing as social distancing in prison! No matter how much they slow us down. They took our visits and only four people in your cell can use the phone! It makes me feel angry because in all reality, every inmate in here knows that they only act like they care when Sacramento is walking around, but they don’t care about us.</br></br>


I’ve been coping with this because I have no choice! I’m just a number and a paycheck to these people.</br></br>


My safety is okay. I know that if I get sick they’d just throw you with other sick people. And just check on you to make sure you aren’t dead yet.</br></br>


I refuse all medical attention here since I’ve been down cause I don’t trust these people. Thank you for giving me an opportunity to talk and for reaching out. God bless, be safe.</br></br>


Sincerely.
