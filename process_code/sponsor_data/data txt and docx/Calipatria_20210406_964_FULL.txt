This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Calipatria.</br></br>

Well it's been a living hell with COVID-19 pandemic in the prison system because we can’t do the things we were used to doing like visits, family visits, yard. We couldn’t even go to school or work if you were what they call an essential worker. For example kitchen workers. Cause you have to feed the prison population.</br></br>

We couldn’t even go to church if thats your cup of tea or if you’re a believer in Jesus Christ. Well to be honest you’re probably more safe in prison with this COVID-19 virus flying around us in the air. But on the other hand it’s sometimes you’re likely to get it.</br></br>  

In a six by nine inch cell because of the six feet social distancing. So it’s damn if you’re on the street and damn if you’re in a prison cell. So it could be scary. Who wants to be in prison for so many years and die in prison and never get out to the real world.</br></br> 

It could be scary and an awful thought to never see the streets or your loved ones again. Especially your children and grandchildren. It could be a very hard pill to swallow but basically anyone can die from anything.</br></br>

Well for me, I haven’t had any visits in five years. It’s not because they don’t love me. It’s because my family is very busy. But we went from visits to no visits due to the COVID-19 pandemic. So I could just imagine how wonderful it could be to have visits.</br></br> 

And then no visits, it could be very depressing. And the inmates not only look forward to seeing family, and loved ones, or friends. They also look forward to the better food they can buy in the visiting room ‘cause they have vending machines so their families can purchase.</br></br> 

So that’s special. The food here sucks.</br></br>

Also with the COVID-19 it was a very bad time because our families weren’t working and couldn’t send their loved ones no money or packages. So it may be rough but thank God for our stimulus checks ‘cause that’s how we got our relief and made ends meet.</br></br>

But for me, I’ve been coping with the COVID-19 pandemic by praying, working out, writing letters, staying positive with good thoughts. I couldn’t even go to my prop 57 board hearing due to the coronavirus.</br></br> 

It pushed it back a few months cause I’m prop 57. I go to board every year in September, so I got a letter from my board hearing lawyer.</br></br> 

So I will be going to board this September 2021. That’s on a Monday. So that and the fact that I already got my first and second dose of COVID-19 vaccine and my stimulus check. Also meeting you was the best thing of this story being written.</br></br>

Well it has been a pleasure to have the time to write to you and to present my story to you in hope that it has enlightened you to the fullest. So that you could understand my feelings and emotions during the COVID-19 pandemic.
