This story was told by a person incarcerated at LA_MensCentral.</br></br>

Caller: We had, it was crazy because we had the most cases of any [unintelligible]. I personally know three people that were actually affected and died from COVID which is really kind of a sad thing because I know that the policies, the procedures, the cleaning practices, the hand sanitation, that just wasn’t there.</br></br>

Even before COVID even hit, we were saying that the free staff would bring it into us. “Why aren’t you wearing your mask, why can’t we get masks?” We weren’t provided with none of that PPE until after everything hit and everybody got sick.</br></br>

And it’s just so, I look at it like, how many inmates died throughout the state of California? And you look at the number of, of COs and stuff that died and I wish people would ask, “Why did so many inmates have to die and so few employees and police?”</br></br>

Well, when us inmates got sick with COVID, they pushed us all into a small, confined area of just the people that were diagnosed sick, even though other people were getting sick. They were moving us at 12, one o’clock in the morning and disrupting our living environments where…</br></br>

They knew if we were housed together and there was a few people were sick, the chances are the majority of people were sick.  And so, they moved us, dislocated us from our primary living locations, and shoved all sick people together. And when you put sick people with sick people, we got sicker.</br></br>

Like myself, I didn’t have the symptoms that I had when they finally put me with the sick people. And I sat there and I reported how bad I was feeling. And I got a chance to get my prison records and stuff and the nurses that they brought in and hired just to come in and take our vitals and stuff, they didn’t know nothing.</br></br>

They falsified a lot of paperwork and the reason I didn’t go man down and get further help is because they were just leaving, you know I been down for 21 years. They were just leaving people’s property there and leaving it there for two weeks.</br></br>

Somebody could steal it, ransack it. And I have a lot of legal documents, I’m back down in LA County on a resentencing hearing and I got a chance to maybe go home, you know, so it was crazy.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, and you know, referring back to the question, how did you cope with the situation?</br></br>

Caller: For me, it was just, just stressful, and just very disheartening to see the callousness and the treatment that we received by prison officials. Like one point, they had a section of people that got guilty, got guilty, got found sick with COVID.</br></br>

And so, they tried to remove surrounding people around them to try to stop the spread of the disease and they refused to move. So, they came in and they threatened us and tried to get us all to sign a waiver that we wouldn’t sue them if we agreed to live with the people that were infected or they brought infected people in.</br></br>

People that were housed with infected people, they brought them into our environment and that’s what had caused the outbreak in the first part. So, it was all very just, very I guess you’d say stressful, it was alarming, it was concerning because they weren’t…</br></br>

They sent me, I was a porter so they sent me to a training course with, to how to handle and treat COVID cleanup and stuff like that. And all the information we received was basically all, it was a lie. And the people that were putting on the orientation were people that were infected and sick with COVID in the first place.
