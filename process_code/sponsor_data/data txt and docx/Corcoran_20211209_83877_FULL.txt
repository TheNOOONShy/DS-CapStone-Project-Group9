This story was told by a person incarcerated at Corcoran.</br></br>

UCI: What has the COVID situation been like at your facility?</br></br>

Caller: Well, the COVID situation has been real, it’s been like a roller coaster. And it’s at times, it’s been a contradiction in itself, you know?</br></br>

And what I mean by that is, of course, I mean, to begin with, you know, there’s only one way the COVID comes in and that’s through the staff that work here.</br></br>

UCI: Right.</br></br>

Caller: And, you know, we - we don’t get it. We don’t get out. And the screening of the staff is, well, from what it appears, it's not good enough because there’s constant outbreaks. There’s constant people catching it.</br></br>

And when I mean staff, not just guards, but also other staff that come in, they work here. Whether it be medical staff or the, the people who – the cooks who come in and prepare the food and stuff like or help us supervisors preparing the food for that matter.</br></br>

And they come in and a lot of times instead of them - they don’t practice social distancing whatsoever. They come up to us, they’re like, you know, just like two to three feet away from us. And they're constantly not taking it as seriously as they should as far as, you know, keeping the mask on and being social distant – socially distant from us.</br></br>

And it just seems like, you know, it’s more of a punishment when there is - or this whole pandemic has been more of a punishment on top of the punishment.</br></br>

UCI: Right.</br></br>

Caller: If that makes any sense.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, 100 percent.</br></br>

Caller: And, yeah, and for me, the - one of the biggest downsides of this is, like, for instance, even before I get into the biggest part I was gonna mention, for instance, you know, they limit our interaction as far as releasing us all outside. We get less outside time because they don’t want so much mingling but, you know, we all do mingle.</br></br>

UCI: Right.</br></br>

Caller: So it kinda - it contradicts that. You know? It contradicts that. Yesterday they limited the amount of people going into the dining hall. You know? Skipping tables.</br></br> 

You know? Using the social distance thing for the dining hall and yet when dining’s done they release all out to the yard together.</br></br>

Caller: So it’s such a huge contradiction. Like, why even go through that?</br></br>

UCI: Right.</br></br>

Caller: To have us do these things that don’t help anybody. Now, my biggest issue I have is visiting, and this is for a lot of us. This, this covers a lot of our issues with regards to having our loved ones come visit us.</br></br> 

You know, now when they come visit us, they either have to have (a) their vaccination card or (b) a negative COVID test within the last 72 hours, I believe. And, which is three days, yeah.</br></br>

And what this - and right now when they come and visit us, and I’m about to get a visit tomorrow from my wife. When she comes in, she has to sit on the other side of the table and we’re only allowed a hug.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>

Caller: And, normally, like if it's for a regular family member then, you know, obviously a kiss on the mouth is not that - or some people, you know, family members and mothers will give them a kiss on the cheek, but we’re not allowed to kiss right now. Which, it really makes no sense cause we’re sitting right across from each other and, you know, we’re all in the same room and more importantly, they’re coming in with - especially if they’re coming in with a negative COVID test.</br></br>

UCI: Right.</br></br>

Caller: And all of us, we get test - we get tested on a normal basis ourselves so if we’re both meeting in a visiting room with negative COVID tests or vaccinated, then why is our interaction with each other under scrutiny?</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>

Caller: You know what I mean?</br></br>

UCI: Yes. 100 percent.</br></br>

Caller: It - it's yeah, and it’s unnecessary. It’s unnecessary. Now when I see my wife tomorrow, we have to - our interaction is under scrutiny if there’s any contact.</br></br> 

And if I do happen to give her a kiss, my visit may be subject to termination. They may tell me, “Hey, you know what? You’re breaking the COVID policy.”</br></br>

“You guys gave each other a kiss so she has to leave.” She drove four hours to get here. “Well, she has to leave.”</br></br>

UCI: Wow.</br></br>

Caller: “You gotta go back to the prison yard.”</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah. And then I could get a write up. I could get disciplinary action against me when, in reality, what actually - what really did I do wrong? Besides showing affection to my loved one?</br></br>

UCI: Yep. No, I totally understand.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah. And so, it - at the end of the day now, because the staff come in and bring this virus in, we're the ones that are - come under scrutiny. And it doesn’t seem like there’s any, how can I say this, like any repercussions on them for bringing it in in the first place.</br></br>

UCI: Exactly. Yep, that’s what I was gonna mention.</br></br>

Caller: All the repercussions - yeah - all the repercussions, they’re all on us.</br></br>

UCI: Yep. As if it’s your fault. It’s crazy.</br></br>

Caller: Right. Exactly. Exactly. And so, you know, and they’re constantly doing that: “Hey, you guys need to do this.</br></br> 

You guys need to do that and we need you to do all these things.” And it is - for the most part, the majority of us are real clean people in here. We clean up.</br></br> 

We’re constantly cleaning surfaces and, and, and, and common areas and, and, and stuff like that. That we do on a normal basis even without the COVID.</br></br>

UCI: Right.</br></br>

Caller: You know?</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>

Caller: But it just seems like, it just seems like - yeah if we don't - if we fall short when it comes to this scrutiny that we’re under, we get - we get disciplined for it. You know, we get some more things taken from us. Whether it be, you know, like I said, visiting or some type of privilege.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: Whether it be buying food, buying food, you know?</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>

Caller: And.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, it’s sad.</br></br>

Caller: And so it, yeah and so, like I said, I just feel that, for the most part, they don't - they don't put their staff under scrutiny. It’s us that go - that gets under s- that’s under scrutiny. And right now, from what I understand, you know, the staff, their union, they're fighting to not be enforced to take the vaccine.</br></br>

UCI: Yep.</br></br>

Caller: They're going back and forth, you know, they're going back and forth in court about that, because it's their free choice, even though they're state employees, you know, and they're sworn officers. They’re sworn to protect and serve.</br></br>

UCI: Exactly.</br></br>

Caller: And by protecting us, who are under their custody.</br></br>

UCI: Yep.</br></br>

Caller: To protect, you know, they should be tested more often than they, than they are now because the last time I had inquired about how, how often the staff are tested, I was told that it’s approximately about a week. They’re - every week.</br></br>

UCI: Jeez.</br></br>

Caller: And - and in one week- I mean, so much can happen in one week.</br></br>

UCI: No, totally.</br></br>

Caller: You know, they can come in and bring the - bring the vir- you know? And in one week that’s really, that’s - that's - I don’t think that’s often enough.</br></br>

UCI: Not at all. And, yeah, it’s ridiculous like you said, if they’re in charge of people and the safety of other people then in - I mean, to me, in my personal opinion.</br></br>

Caller: Right.</br></br>

UCI: I don’t think it should be a question about that 'cause it’s like you signed up for the job, like this is what your job is, you know what I mean?</br></br>

Caller: Right.</br></br>

UCI: No, totally. And sorry, if I’m quiet. I’m just letting you talk. I’m just - 'cause it’s when we -</br></br>

Caller: Okay. No, no, Go right ahead.</br></br>

UCI: You know, when we go over these recordings, like, it’s just- if I’m constantly interrupting you, like you know it drives it crazy. So I'm just letting you talk. I got some other questions to ask you.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, tell me.</br></br>

UCI: So what about - like so you mentioned vaccinations. Like have people been getting vaccinations at your at Corcoran?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, yeah. Definitely. They do offer vaccinations and they, and I’m glad you brought that up too, with the vaccinations, recently, just recently, I don’t know if you’re aware, but they’re actually kinda forcing it on us now. I took the vaccination even though I didn’t want to because I’ve never caught the COVID.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: I don’t know if I’m asymptom- I don’t know if I’m asymptomatic or what the deal is, but I’ve never caught it. I've never tested positive. But just recently, I’m not sure if you’re aware, and I believe it’s on the websites or what not, if you’re not vaccinated you will not be allowed to have visiting privileges period.</br></br>

Caller: And so -</br></br>

UCI: That’s crazy.</br></br>

Caller: If I wanna see my wife and my loved ones, I have to have to take this vaccination, regardless of any religious beliefs or beliefs I have. Because the few rights that I have now are infringed on if you, if you - in my opinion. And so, I recently had to take the vaccination because I’m not gonna, I’m not gonna, I’m not gonna be penalized by not being able to see my loved ones now.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, and so at your facility.</br></br>

Caller: Oh.</br></br>

UCI: Sorry, go ahead. Is there - did you wanna say more about that?</br></br>

Caller: No, no, no, no, that - no, no, yeah. Yeah, no - I was just gonna say that, as of now, now they’re even - they’ve been asking, they’ve been asking everybody to take the booster shot. Now, right now, they're going through alphabetical order from your last name and giving everybody the booster shot who took it six to eight months ago.</br></br>

UCI: Wow. That’s crazy.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, booster shots are going around right now.</br></br>

UCI: So.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah.</br></br>

UCI: What - did people - how was the outbreaks? Like did a lot of people get sick? At Corcoran?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah. You know what? I have a newsletter that I get that it has all the statistics on that and Corcoran is one of the ones that got hit the worst because this one is - especially if it’s dorm living. Because there’s so many people just stacked like sardines.</br></br>

UCI: Yep.</br></br>

Caller: In dorm living. And when - you can only imagine, in that it spreads like wildfire. In dorm living.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>

Caller: So, all the prisons that have dorm living got literally thousands of cases. Of positive cases.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>

Caller: Thous- since the pandemic started. </br></br>

UCI: And so.</br></br>

Caller: There have been - there - uh huh?</br></br>

UCI: It’s just - how does- how did the staff treat the people that were sick? Did anybody get any medicine? Like, were they quarantined? Like?</br></br>

Caller: No this is - I’ll tell you what they do. What they do is they take you and they lock you down in a cell. That's it. For 14 days.</br></br>

UCI: No medicine?</br></br>

Caller: They lock you down in the cell. No medicine. The nurses come around and just pretty much tell you to drink a lot of water. Stay hydrated.</br></br>

UCI: Wow.</br></br>

Caller: That’s what they do to them. That's what they do. They don’t give us, you know, electrolytes. They don’t - none of that. They just tell you.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: The only way is - you’ll go - is if you can’t breathe, then they’ll take you to the outside hospital. That’s literally - if you’re gasping for air - that’s the only way, that’s the only, that’s it. But other than that, you just get a 14-day quarantine and they just tell you to drink a lot of water. That’s it.</br></br>

UCI: That’s insane.</br></br>

Caller: If you test positive.</br></br>

UCI: Did you wanna call back? Do you have time to call back again?</br></br>

Caller: You know what? There’s a line right now. I don’t know if I can. But I can call back another time though.</br></br>

UCI: Okay.</br></br>

Caller: Another day.</br></br>

UCI: I appreciate it.</br></br>

Caller: You can just tell - yeah. Yeah, you can just tell, you can just tell by my voice, if you want to again.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: Just tell me the time, like you did this time, and I'll do it.</br></br>

UCI: Fantastic. Thank you so much, and you know, let your friends know if they want to also have their stories told. You know, tell their stories about their experience like the hotline is up 5:00 to 9:00 p.m. Monday through Friday.</br></br>

Caller: Okay. Will do. Thank you.</br></br>

UCI: Thank you, brother.</br></br>

Caller: Thank you for your time too.</br></br>

UCI: You too.</br></br>

Caller: Bye-bye.</br></br>

UCI: Peace.</br></br>

Caller: All right. Have a good one.</br></br>

UCI: You too.
