Prison conditions
Still this prison is putting large military style tents on the yard prepairing for the worst I guess. They have portable showers and port-a-potties on the central yard as well. These things should bring fear to my heart and perhaps to someday would but as I said, the Lord has given me peace and I am not worried. I do feel a great deal of remorse for what is shown on the news and some of the incredible suffering. I will continue to pray. Thier are several reports of inhumane treatment of inmates being housed in chapels here at the prison with no toilets having to use a bucket and showering in freezing conditions using a water hose to clean themselves. Custody allowing other inmates to pack other inmates property (which is not allowed) and the lost of valuables. Also staff packing inmates property and not using a property card to correctly inventory, again alot of lost valuables. This is only some of it, however, this was not my experience. Just some of the dark side of what exist here.
