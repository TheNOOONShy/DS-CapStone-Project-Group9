This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Delano.</br></br>

All the other 20 inmates were put in the same building in dirty cells, all single cell. All of our property came with us, so we had our appliances. However, we were unable to plug in our appliance because none of our cells had outlets.</br></br> 

They had the wiring for plugs, but they had the covers over the outlets so we couldn’t plug in. Now I’m told that for the next 14 days I will only come out of my cell every three days for a three-minute shower and back in.</br></br> 

I was one of the lucky ones that had some personal books to read that kept me busy. The building had about three cells that did have electrical outlets for those that had medical appliances that needed to plug in.</br></br> 

My stay there was 17 days because on the 14th day there was no doctor to sign my release on a Friday so I was stuck for the weekend. This happened on September of 2020. I was lucky to go back to the cell I was in before I got moved. Dang cellie, he never was moved.</br></br> 

I tried to avoid going to a medical as much as possible to avoid another incident. Giving up on some medical treatment hoping that it was enough to avoid being quarantined again. Wearing a mask was not enough because even if you wear it just coming across someone that’s infected will still put you in quarantine.</br></br> 
        
Well I found out that it doesn’t matter how much we try to avoid others. Medical has its flaws. Every person that takes medication had to go to medical, take off their mask. take the medicine in front of medical staff, and drink from a fountain that is not being wiped after each patient.
