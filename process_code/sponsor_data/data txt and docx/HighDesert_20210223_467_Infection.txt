This letter was written by a person incarcerated at High Desert.</br></br>Now as for the pandemic, I caught COVID my self being an critical worker for COVID because they did not provide us critical workers with the right PPE materials. It wasn’t given to us during the time it broke out here and HDSP. However my experience I could not taste, smell, nor eat. It felt like my life was coming to an end.</br></br>I was placed on quarantine in a cold cell with no blanket or sheets for three days. Feeling like I was going to die until a nurse finally saw me and ordered me some medication. However I am a COVID survivor and to keep it simple it wasn’t very easy experiencing that, it was very difficult to cope with. No phone calls, no mail, no canteen.</br></br>Yeah it’s deep just thinking about it. I am happy to still be alive and make it through. I wasn’t the only one who went through and made it. Two inmates died!</br></br> 

So it’s a blessing to be alive. At the same time I did not want to be a critical worker based on the whole experience I went through. I caught COVID, survived, and would’ve appreciated an expedited release being that I have a few months left and they denied me.</br></br>And the population on this yard all caught it based on CDCR poor decision. By placing inmates who had it from say yard on this GP main line yard thinking that it would resolve everything all it did was spread. However it’s not or there isn’t a voice for us. None of us including our loved ones like how we are limited to 30-minute Zoom or Skype visits, it’s bad here.</br></br> 

We don’t make our draws for months at a time whenever store is ran. And a whole lot to explain but I’m staying strong. Hoping to make it out of here alive.
