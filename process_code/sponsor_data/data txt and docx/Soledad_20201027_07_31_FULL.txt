This story was told by a person incarcerated at Soledad.</br></br>

Caller: OK, so picture if you can, your bathroom. In your bathroom, you have another person living with you. Inside that room, it's only the size of the bathroom.</br></br>

So in that room, you have two TVs, two fans, two hot pots, one toilet and one sink. Whenever you want to eat your food your cellie might have to use the toilet, and vice versa. The other thing is, you're in that cell 163 hours a week.</br></br>

UCI: Wow.</br></br>

Caller: Before the prison pandemic, we were out of our cells from 6 a.m. to 9 p.m. at night, except for one hour because they do count.</br></br> 

UCI: Yup.</br></br>

Caller: Another thing is you receive three small kid meals a day. The food that they feed you, the budget is $3.50 per inmate per day.</br></br>

UCI: Mhmm.</br></br>

Caller: So you can imagine what you’re fed.</br></br>

UCI: Right.</br></br>

Caller: You don't have family or friends that can send you what they call a care package. Or send you money through the electronic system. It’s called JPay. You can't go to the store, there's a store here.</br></br>

And they stocked it with all the needed items like food items and stuff you want to cook with and all your hygiene. But you can also order the same things from the package. With the restitution, some guys can't really get money in because when they get money in, if your family sends you $100 you only get 45.</br></br>

UCI: Right.</br></br>

Caller: And everyone has restitution because when you go through the court, you gotta- they give everyone restitution now. There used to be a time when you came to prison, and they didn't give you restitution unless you had a victim. Now everyone has to pay restitution.</br></br>

So if a guy gets- say you, you're blessed by your grandmother and she gives you $300, you get 135. The prison sends the rest to the victims fund, regardless if you have victims or not. Packages, they're all private corporations. Your people order online, some of the name companies, one is Walkenhorst's, the other one is Access Securepak, and one is called Union Supply Direct.</br></br>

They charge you like $10 for shipping fee, but you can order like television, radio, tennis shoes, your clothing, food. It's a good value for what you get out of there, but some of the prices are high.</br></br>

UCI: Yup.</br></br>

Caller: Before they had that program, people's family could just send stuff in. And what was good about that is if you had a grandmother or somebody had a whole bunch of canned goods, they could just send the canned goods in the mail.</br></br> 

They stopped that program. It actually made it more efficient but now people have to pay out of the pocket to get the packages. You're allowed three or four of those a year every 90 days to get one. For this year because of COVID-19 they're allowing us to get one extra package.</br></br>

But your family still has to buy that. Most of the prison jobs pay from eight cents to 24 cents an hour. They max you out at 150 hours so most inmates aren't making more than $36 a month.</br></br>

Now I just told you you can spend 220 at the store so you know where that other money is coming from, the street. The other thing is they have what they call Prison Industry Authority here. That's guys that make the shoes that we wear, the boots, the clothing.</br></br>

And those guys get paid more money. They make- the most they make as $1.10 an hour and they- those- it's only- put it this way: This facility I’m at has 2000 people, only 300 guys are PIA.</br></br> 

UCI: Mhmm. Wow.</br></br>

Caller: Plumbers- if you're a plumber, electrician they pay you $1 an hour you know, if you got that skill training.</br></br>

Some of the depressing things are more that we don't have updated media like you have on the street. We have Direct TV but they only give us the local channels. ABC, CBS, NBC, PBS, CW, so we don't get MTV, we don't get CNN, we don't get any of that stuff.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah that does not occupy your time.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, yeah. So you know as far as a guy being in the cell that amount of time- and this is a level two facility.</br></br>

UCI: OK.</br></br>

Caller: Level two facilities are the second lowest. So like San Quentin right now is a level two, Folsom is a level two. This place I'm at, I’m in Soledad. This is a level two.</br></br> 

It's supposed to be least restrictive because you earn your way down from the level fours like Pelican Bay and High Desert State and Corcoran. And then there's a level in between called a level three, so once you get down to this level you've gotten more freedom, because you've earned it from positive programming.</br></br>

UCI: Right.</br></br>

Caller: So guys here usually have about 15 years to 20 years in the, in the penal system. They are doing expedited releases. But those are for guys that only have like two or three years remaining.</br></br>

This is the number one prison though that lifers are going home, they're beating San Quentin. In Soledad- I mean um, I forgot the other place- Solano.</br></br>

UCI: Uh huh.</br></br>

Caller: What were you going to say?</br></br>

UCI: What is like what's the current COVID situation there right now?</br></br>

Caller: We had some cases, we were the last ones to get COVID here. This place for a long time didn't get it. They did a raid on 300 inmates who are outside agency.</br></br>

When they did that raid, those officers infected guys, because nobody around here had it, you know, only police can bring it in or staff. So no one had it, and then after that, we started getting cases. Currently, they have about 40 active cases.</br></br>

But 170 people have been affected, you know, but now, they only have about 40 guys that have it. And so what they- the way they have it is there’s 10 housing units here. They have them segregated, so we actually go to the recreational yard by ourselves, we don't go with any other wing.</br></br>

UCI: Mhmm.</br></br>

Caller: Only if you're on the job site do you socialize, but they gave us- we got N95 masks, everybody got those now. So the guy from Twitter paid for that- Jack Dorsey.</br></br>

UCI: Oh, yeah.</br></br>

Caller: So-</br></br>

UCI: So that's going OK, is there anything that concerns you?</br></br>

Caller: The number one thing that they can do- the level that we need them to do, is they need to get the occupancy down to 95 percent. If they don't get the occupancy down to 95 percent, there's no way to have space.</br></br>

You know, it’s just- because one housing unit, say it’s 175 cells, that's designed for one person to be in the cell, they got two people in every cell. So you have a housing unit with 350 people in it. It’s only twelve showers.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: So- it's, that's why I use the bathroom there, because that's what the cell is actually like. In a college dorm room, at most colleges are bigger than that, and you don't use the bathroom in there. You know, you walk down the hall to the bathroom, unless it's one of the new age dorms, or you know, it's a real confined space.</br></br>

San Quentin and Folsom have the smallest cells, but these are pretty small. You know, the newer prisons that were built in the 90s, with the prison boom, they have larger cells. So, but just imagine you're in the bathroom for 24 hours a day.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: They bring your food to you too.</br></br>

UCI: So if possible, could you like- so COVID started, you know, I mean, it really blew up like in March, and so you said you're the last facility to get it?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, we didn't get a case until like, September. Actually, was it? It was September or- wait a second. It was August.</br></br>

UCI: Wow.</br></br>

Caller: We didn't get a case until August.</br></br>

UCI: So could you like trace? So every month? So as soon as March happened, everything went down on lockdown- no more visitation, no more programming, nothing, right?</br></br>

Caller: Well, yeah, they stopped visitation in March.</br></br>

UCI: Right, OK.</br></br>

Caller: They were just being- preparing for it. Now, you can go online to the CDC website, and it'll tell you under COVID-19, it'll tell you the infection at each prison.</br></br>

Or you can go to the San Quentin Prison Law Office, they will tell you that information too. They manage those numbers because they have to report it to the health department and the counties.</br></br>

UCI: So since I mean, since you guys have been on lockdown, and off and on consistently since March, I mean, pretty much the whole time, what have you been doing specifically to your wellbeing and like your mental health and stuff?</br></br>

Caller: Man I’ve been reading, I've been reading. I'm taking a couple of distance learning courses from a college that's here. I'm taking two college courses. And then I'm doing this, we have a program here called the Five Ventures, you can look it up.</br></br>

The other thing is, you know, it's just, it's like a daily grind. You know, the human condition is awesome. It can adapt to any situation given to man but you just have to, like, figure out a program for you. Some guys don't have it that good.</br></br>

They can't, you know, you don't have a TV. We have guys in here with no TVs in their cell. So they're in there 23 hours a day, or they have no radio, they're in there 23 hours a day, you know.</br></br>

UCI: Wow.</br></br>

Caller: Because when I say the 23 hours, you're actually in there 24 because they shower you three days a week.</br></br> 

UCI: Mhmm.</br></br>

Caller: So and that's really what I mean- you're only out of the cell five hours a week. Normally we'd be out of the cell from nine, that's it from 6 a.m. so that's like we'd be out of the cell 18 hours.</br></br>

UCI: And- so how do you think I mean, do you do you have, you know, family and stuff on the outs?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, I have parents and I have friends. I have a friend that sends me packages. And I have both my parents are able to send me money. But there's guys in here that don't have that.</br></br>

UCI: Right. How's that affected you? I mean, how's it affected your loved ones?</br></br>

Caller: Well, I'm able to call ‘em, you know, I can't tell you how it's affecting them because they can’t visit me, but you know, they just keep telling me, let me know when visiting is available, you know what I'm saying? So, I know it's not going to happen this year, 'cause you can tell by the program, the way they're managing it.</br></br>

It’s rough in here. I mean it's, you know, we had one suicide this year in this building. Other than that, that was about it.</br></br>

You know, guys are just coping with it as much as they can. I mean, because they see what everybody else is dealing with on the street.</br></br>

UCI: And so do you guys, you said you have N95 masks now?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah.</br></br> 

UCI: OK, so everybody's got at least one?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, well, what they did was, they made us these cloth masks. They made- they gave us each five. Well, when they actually got COVID in, they started giving them out to people that were like working in the laundry and all that.</br></br>

And then finally they filtered them out to the building. Now you can just walk up- they got, they got a locker that they store em in and you walk up “Hey, Officer, can I get one of them masks? I serve food out here.” So anybody that serves food, they get a couple of them.</br></br>

They still do our laundry. So our laundry is being done every week they wash your, your whites, your blues, they wash your sheets, they wash your blankets once a month. This is one of the better weather climates in prisons, it doesn't really get too hot, and it doesn't really get too cold here.</br></br>

UCI: That's good. Is there anything that you can think of that would make this- I mean- anything better right now?</br></br>

Caller: Like I say if a group of people, of do-gooders want to give these guys care packages, because they're going to be away from their family. And when I say care package, I'm talking like toothpaste, deodorant, soap.</br></br>

You know, they have limitations on what we can get in here, but there's a there's a mechanism for people to do. We used to have churches donate that stuff.</br></br>

UCI: OK. That's great. Is there anything else you want- for anybody to know about your experience at all?</br></br>

Caller: I mean, don't believe what you see on TV because it’s totally different in here than that. It's not like it was in the 80s. It is not as violent as it was, but there are yards like that. It’s nothing like that.</br></br>

UCI: Right. OK. Well, I appreciate your time, man. It just- I know we're gonna get cut off right now. So thank you for participating in this- in this call.</br></br>

Caller: OK, thanks.</br></br>

UCI: All right.</br></br>

Caller: Have a good night.</br></br>

UCI: You too.
