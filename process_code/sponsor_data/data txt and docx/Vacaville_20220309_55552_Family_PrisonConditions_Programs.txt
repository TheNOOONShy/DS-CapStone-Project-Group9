This story was told by a person incarcerated at Vacaville.</br></br>

UCI: Sorry, how has the COVID situation affected your loved ones?</br></br>

Caller: Oh, it’s just kind of bad. My brother had COVID. He had COVID-19. He had to be quarantined for about 10-14 days. He had [unintelligible]. We try to keep in contact [unintelligible] in case something bad happens we would know. We’ve talked to each other before it do happen.</br></br>

UCI: And how have you been coping with the crisis?</br></br>

Caller: It’s been kind of difficult for me because I’m not used to having my life turned upside down due to COVID-19 and that I have to carry myself in a certain way. That I have to follow the rules and regulations according to the facility to try to stay COVID-free.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, definitely. What has it been like for you to have because I know you said you’re in a separated area. What has it been like for you to have reduced visitation and programming?</br></br>

Caller: If you have COVID-19, they put you in a separate area, in another part of the institution. They warn everybody that you got it. But they separate you from the ones who do not have it.</br></br>

UCI: And what about programming and visitation? Has that been reduced?</br></br>

Caller: About medication?</br></br>

UCI: Visitation?</br></br>

Caller: Yes. They have. They normally take you to the outside hospital. Either take you and put you into another [unintelligible] where they can keep a close eye on you and find out how you’re doing and take a lot of tests. They normally test you everyday and make sure you feel alright or sick. They check your temperature, your blood pressure, and stuff like that.</br></br>

UCI: Okay. What would have made the situation better at your facility?</br></br>

Caller: What happened?</br></br>

UCI: What would have made the situation better?</br></br>

Caller: What kind of situation is it? Where I am at?</br></br>

UCI: Like is there anything that the facility could have done to make the COVID situation a little bit easier on you?</br></br>

Caller: Yes. There is a lot that could have been done such as you know, make sure that they give you cleaner for your hands. Make sure that you’re able to take a shower whenever you need to shower. Make sure to keep the air around your place clean and have the cell clean. Stuff like that.</br></br>

UCI: Okay. What else do you want people to know about your experience?</br></br>

Caller: Well, you know, listen up. They can keep inmates far apart so they can socially distance. Six feet distance right? But it is difficult to stay socially distanced from another inmate while you are in the same institution, you know what I’m saying? So you have your own cell, your own living quarter.
