UCI: What's it been like for your loved ones to have to go through this as well? Just to like know that you're going through this on the inside?</br></br>

Caller: It's mental stress for them. It's emotional because they can't hug us, they can't spend time with us, and they can barely see us through this video conferencing. Video visiting going on. So, it's just mental stress for them.
