This story was told by a person incarcerated at Avenal.</br></br>

Caller: They were trying to play catch up on something that was way ahead of them, you know. And they started putting up these partitions, these plexiglass partitions. I mean they’re trying to do all those little, little things, these little subtle things to us, to make it seem like they’re doing something, but in reality, whatever the public has been told, whatever public sign, these people have failed miserably, containing the COVID.</br></br> 

There’s not too many cases now, again, again they’re starting to reopen the program for us again, we’re still limited on the amount of things we can do like an exercise equipment, no softball equipment, but they’re letting these guys play handball, which is, you know, four guys to a court and there are 16 guys out there.</br></br> 

So you gotta whole group of guys again, just breathing all over each other without masks on. So, I don’t hardly ever go outside anymore anyways, so it doesn’t matter to me but, I mean the biggest, the biggest problem to me is this administration has done was to move people.</br></br> 

And, you know, even though only staff members, they know what the hell was going on when that was happening, because of course you know, we can only ask the officers that are working in the building, “What’s going on?” And when they don’t know, then, then nobody knows and we don’t know what happens so, but here we are.</br></br>

2021, I don’t know how many new cases are still here in the prison, but I know that those of us that are able, we have a good mask, a good supply of masks, the N95s, the pop masks, we’re making our homemade masks now. They would frown on that back in the past, but now they don’t care that we make our own masks.</br></br> 

You know, we have to do what we have to do for ourselves because, you know, in all, in all seriousness, we’re kind of butt hurt you know, these guys don’t really give a shit about us. You know, so, it’s hard to explain to our families, the way that we live in here, because you know, they can’t experience it, but I can understand that the world is like a big prison right now because of COVID.
