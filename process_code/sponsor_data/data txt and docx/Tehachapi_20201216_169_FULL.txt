Dear UC Irvine student,</br></br>      
                                                                                             
Hello, my name is [redacted]. I hope you and all staff, students are doing well. You wrote to my celly (cellmate) but he isn’t gonna write back. He handed me the letter you wrote, so I thought I’d take a few minutes to respond.</br></br>
 
First, I want to thank you all for thinking of us that are incarcerated, stuck between a rock and a hard place. As requested, I have no problem sharing my experience locked-up during this extremely hard time. Doing time with pandemic and with holidays, we can’t even see our loved ones.</br></br>
 
I’ll share in my next letter if it's OK with you, even though it wasn’t me who you wrote to. Sorry. I’m not too good of a writer. I would like to call but we only get one phone call per day (15 minutes), which I use to call family. So please bear with me and give me the OK to write. I hope and wish you all a merry Christmas and a happy new year.</br></br>
 
Sincerely,</br></br>
