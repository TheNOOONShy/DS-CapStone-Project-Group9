What has it been like to be inside without visits? I’ve actually never had a visit, so when they stopped us from using the phone it was dismaying to be unable to hear my mother’s, sister’s, and brother’s voice. I had to learn from here that my niece and nephew tested positive three years and one year, respectively, for COVID-19. They are well now.</br></br>

And how have you been coping with this crisis? I continue to pray for everyone’s safety. I have only been sick once and 32 years of my life for 24 hours and no longer. So for me, it was the word of God, studying chemistry and Brazilian Portuguese, history, and exercise. I speak with my family as much as possible and attempt to stay positive, though at times I have dark thoughts. These things can be rather disconcerting.
