This story was told by a person incarcerated at Avenal.</br></br>

Caller: It was hard to be able to wear a mask. And it was uh, they harassed you, they didn’t, the staff didn’t wear a mask. It was um, you know as quick as we wanted to be able to wear a mask, they weren’t letting us wear them, it wasn’t until like a whole building tested positive, that they took it more seriously.</br></br> UCI: Are they saying that because of identification purposes?</br></br>Caller: Can’t hear.</br></br>UCI: Are they saying you can’t wear it for identification purposes?</br></br>Caller: That’s what they were saying in the beginning, and it was really ironic because they called me over by name, and told me that I couldn’t wear a face covering because they couldn’t identify who I was.</br></br> UCI: Okay, what’s being handled differently now?</br></br>Caller: What’s being handled differently now, right. The hard part now is nobody wants to get tested because the results now are, they’re gonna take the whole dorm, and I kinda get it, I understand nobody wants their whole dorm, to you know like if one person tests positive inside a dorm they take all eight people and put them over in a lock-up unit in quarantine.</br></br> 

So everybody’s property has to get boxed up, packed up, and you have to move over there, um freezing cold cell for 14 days and come back.</br></br> But at the same time, you know, this second wave of the pandemic, what’s gonna happen? What’s gonna happen when the flu starts going around?
