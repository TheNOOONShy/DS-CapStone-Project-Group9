This story was told by a person incarcerated at LA_MensCentral.</br></br>

UCI: Damn, yeah that’s very hard to hear and very unfortunate that things went down that way.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, I just wish there was some more oversight and somebody who, like the CDC or somebody, they had no plan or no procedures. The inmates see, when they would try to push them on plans and procedures, they would just get lied to.</br></br>

And they kept notes and they asked them, “Why aren’t you guys wearing a mask? There’s a big breakout.” “Oh, we’ll deal with it when it hits.” And then it hits, and then, I think nine inmates, seven to nine died at Avenal State Prison and it was just too many. I bet you maybe one to two COs or free staff died.</br></br>

And that’s just, like I said, because they got to go home, socially distance, and take proper medicine to heal themselves and get better. We were just crammed into a, we were crammed into a small, confined area, sick with sick people just gets people sicker.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah. Apart from that, is there anything else that you think would be very helpful for people on the outside to know?</br></br>

Caller: Man, just that, you know, we’re not all child molesters, rapists, and murderers here in prison. There’s a lot of people, like myself, who’ve been down for 21 years and have got a proven record of rehabilitation and stuff.</br></br>

By the grace of God here, I just got sentenced, ten years off, and I go back on the [redacted] of next month and hopefully maybe they’ll take the life sentence off. You know, that just because we’ve committed crimes, we’re not all just horrible people in here.</br></br>

Sometimes, I think that the media portrays us as all child molesters, rapists, and murderers and we’re not all child molesters, rapists, and murderers. We’re human beings that made a mistake. We didn’t make a mistake that should deprive us of having a clean environment to live in or be treated like, basically felt like we been treated like animals during the whole pandemic basically.</br></br>

And it’s sad that people don’t see that a majority of people are coming out of prison anyways. And I sometimes think about how people are treated like worse than animals, how do you expect them to be treated when they get out on the outside?</br></br>

They control them here, but when they don’t have any control out there, maybe situations come back. And I think it makes for a more dangerous society for our families and loved ones, that they actually create people and so much hate and animosity by the way that we’re treated inside here, especially when it came to the pandemic and all that.</br></br>

Getting COVID and the lack of information and the unsanitary conditions and being forced to move and just the treatments. I was one of the most outspoken person. I filed three grievances and it’s basically CDCR just said, “We’re doing the best we can.”</br></br>

Well, I think they could’ve done a lot better, CDCR, as far as… And I think just the experience of coming here to LA and being made to sit in a paper suit, freezing, freezing cold teeth chattering, begging for help, and they just said, “We’re not equipped to handle this, you need to file a complaint.”</br></br>

And I still haven’t been filed a complaint. Quite truthfully I’m scared to file a complaint because the people who do file complaints, you know, bad things happen to them. But it’s a lot better than it was when I came here 21 years ago.</br></br>

But at the same time, I don’t think that any, if anybody was to come and look at the process that an inmate has to go through, coming into LA County, where you’re made to stay in a paper suit for two days in freezing cold conditions until you get medically evaluated and your COVID test, that’s just not a proper way to treat somebody.</br></br>

They could give them a blanket or something, a hot meal or something, but literally for three days, I didn’t see nothing. And, you know, I just, by the grace of God hopefully, I get a chance to, to be able to breathe the air of freedom and do right and honorable things like I will do if I'm given that chance.
