Happy New Year! I’m from San Diego area, and currently in Chino prison (CIM). Never been in prison and am bewildered to say the least. More disheartening due no, family, etc., one out there. Here’s my c-19 story.</br></br>

I'm housed in two man cells on C yard. Also known as east yard. We’re two miles east of main prison. There’s approximately 790 inmates on this yard, except for now we are on a COVID program.</br></br>

One entire building of 100 cells was emptied for c-19 isolation for entire prison, all yards. To do this, inmates were transferred in spring to various prisons. The transfers stopped because supposedly inmates from here were positive c-19, and brought into San Quentin.</br></br>

On September 24th, many inmates were tested here for c-19 and unfortunately many had positive tests. When you get a positive test here, you must pack your belongings and go to the isolation unit on this yard. You lose your cell during this procedure.</br></br>

If you show no symptoms, as I did, you get out of isolation in 12 to 14 days, and put back in a regular building. We’re told we can’t get or give c-19 for 84 days from positive test date.</br></br>

They’ve just begun to retest those that are close or at 84 days of positive. A few, before major testing, had a positive with random testing. Only a handful on C yard, this so-called second wave, so far are positive.
