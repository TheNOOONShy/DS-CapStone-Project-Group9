It’s difficult being locked up during this time of COVID-19, not being able to see or talk to family and friends, and not to be able to say goodbye to the ones you love that lost to COVID-19, or to be able to put them to rest properly.</br></br>

Some people think we’re safer being inside prison, but this is not a clean place. We only get cleaning supplies once a week and when the COs feel like giving it to us. We’re not able to get mask often. I’ve had the same one for 4 months that I have to wash nightly.</br></br>

There is no way to social distance the six feet if someone sleeps right above you, even more so in cell  living. Two people in one cell, that’s not six feet apart for sure, it’s four feet that I’ve counted. I feel that inmates that have five to six months to go should be let out to make room for the 6-feet social distancing, that is one way to slow down COVID-19 in prison.</br></br>

I cope by pray to the lord of my understanding for better days to come and having faith in that.</br></br>

Thanks so much. Please be safe and God bless.
