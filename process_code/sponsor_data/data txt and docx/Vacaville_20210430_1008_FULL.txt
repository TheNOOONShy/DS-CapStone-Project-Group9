This COVID pandemic caught CDCR with its pants down. It was Ill prepared and for the first 6 months, they were running around like headless chickens. Safety protocols are never followed up on. Cleaning supplies are non-existent. We are kept together unit by unit. It’s a real restricted movement. I broke a bone in my hand. The bone was sticking out for six months before I got an operation. They placed two surgical pins through my bone. And after a few weeks, the pins became dislodged, worked its way out, and broke through the skin. I complained for weeks, all that they said was there’s nothing to be done. </br></br>
When I broke my hand they made a brace out of cardboard. I filed a federal civil suit against the prison. I’m single celled. I rarely come out. I’m taking college courses, which I do in my cell. Cell feedings at first there were lots of COVID tests. Not anymore. They offered vaccines. I refused. I don’t trust it. We haven’t had contact visits in over a year. So tell me why this place is flooded with drugs? Like I said I stay to myself workout in my cell. I have to bathe in my sink cause we only have access to showers 3 times a week. I’m in perfect shape so I don’t worry about my safety. It’s just me.</br></br>
 I don’t like anyone and I would rather read a book than listen to these idiots. I don’t want to hear about places you have never been and shit you’ve never done. The name of the game is self-improvement. Being the best version of me and being productive.Other than that, everyday is ground hog day. I do the same thing every day. I don’t count days. I count push-ups.</br></br>
But there are positives every day. We go on and off quarantine every other week it seems.I have lots more to share but I have a lot of things I’m working on right now. I can chat later. I have plenty of stories to share. If you want to know how corrupt this place is, just look me up on Facebook. You will see that my profile picture is inside my prison cell. Imagine that.</br></br>
