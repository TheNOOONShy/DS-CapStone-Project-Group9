To whom it may concern:</br></br>

Hello. I am currently serving life in California Institution for Women.</br></br>On July 30th I was told I had COVID-19. Seven days prior we were on modified program due to the outbreak. The first test I took I was negative.</br></br>
I was assigned to a program they call IDAP. I am a wheelchair pusher, but I had not been working. I am not considered a critical worker, so that means I never left the unit (Harrison A).</br></br>Seven days later I tested positive. On July 30th I was moved to a quarantine unit RC. I was placed in cell.</br></br>The conditions of the cell were this. Both windows were broke out, glass was on the outside and inside of cell. The screens were pulled back allowing birds, rodents, and dirt to come into cell.</br></br>
There was black and green mold in sink and toilet. I was given three to five minutes to clean the room myself with a respiratory disease. The chemicals that were given to me was in a broken spray bottle and was told to use pads to clean with (pads) sanitary napkins.</br></br>Even though I never had a fever, I had chills, sweats, cough, shakiness, awful headaches, no taste or smell, vomiting. It took me two hours to clean the room. They did do vitals but never a doctor to listen to my lungs.</br></br>

We slept in the same bedding for the first nine days of quarantine. We were only allowed five-minute showers every other day. If they didn’t mess up on the hallways, sometimes three days. I understand the title 15 says they only have to give us showers every 72 hours, but with exception they should have allowed us to have two to five minute showers a day, two shifts.</br></br>

It takes for our families and outside agencies to call down here and fight for them to do anything naturally for us. I know we are in prison but for them not to do the same things that come natural to a human being is beyond me. We have never had any follow ups to check if there is any lasting effects.</br></br>

They now have us back on quarantine. I now live in Wilson A. We had one positive test, they removed her and put her in RC.</br></br>

They do shower us every day now, but the point is it keeps coming here when it shouldn’t.</br></br>I was only sick for seven days. The test after I was tested positive came back negative non-detected.</br></br>

Medical here is not what it should be. They take our temps daily but out of the 300 women that had COVID in and from June to September only about 20 of them had fever.</br></br>I have written two other places about this with no response. I want to get a lawyer but the lawyer I wrote the letter came back saying unable to forward but a stamp from the mail room said accidentally opened.</br></br>How many other letters have been stopped in the mail room and not delivered? I am going to attempt to mail this to you.</br></br>Sincerely</br></br>
If you have any questions please feel free to write me.</br></br>
And yes I am willing to write down everything to anyone if you need me to.</br></br>
Thank you for your time.
