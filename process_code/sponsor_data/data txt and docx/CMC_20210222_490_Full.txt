Dear UCI PrisonPandemic,</br></br>

First and foremost, I want to thank you for the letters. It takes a lot of commitment to sit down and type someone in prison a letter. Especially someone who you never even met, but thank you for your concern. As you know life in prison has changed.</br></br> 

I am not going to sugar coat anything, I am going to give you the straight truth. I am what you call a real person. I call things like I see it, that's all I know how to do.</br></br>

I have been incarcerated 21 years so I have seen change before the COVID-19 crisis. The COVID-19 pandemic just gave CDCR more power to really take everything from the prisoners. I understand that COVID-19 made it where that had to be restrictions. And so we are dealing with those restrictions but lets not be fooled, these prison yards are dumping grounds pre-COVID inflicted inmates.</br></br> 

Thirty days ago 19 inmates that are a part of two separate fire crews tested positive for COVID-19.</br></br>

I am at a fire camp where there's three fire crews. When I found out that I had tested positive, I wasn't surprised because I began having the symptom around January 1, 2021. I knew I had COVID-19. I began to lose my taste and my smell. I felt fatigue, tired, coughing, sneezing, runny nose, and other minor symptoms.</br></br> 

I had the virus. Once I began to accept that I would be living with this virus for a while, I kept a positive outlook like I have been doing with any other situation that arises while I am in prison.</br></br>

I am a positive person already so I wasn't going to let a virus stop me from achieving my goal, and that I'd to get out of this hell hole. The COVID experience was short lived on this yard. Once the administration learned that they didn't have any control of this virus they took us all off quarantine and opened the yard back up. We were all moving around each other again, negatives and positives.</br></br> 

That's what it has become in prison. People are walking around asking each other "are you negative or positive?" It has died down now because we are all back running around with each other.</br></br>

Being in prison at this time is very hard for some people, and the reasons why are because some of these inmates have family on the outside that have the virus and they are more worried about them. Being inside of prison is hard, it is the hardest thing any human being can ever encounter. I have encountered it for 21 years and 2021 will be my last year.</br></br>

I have endured everything that you could ever imagine in prison, nothing sexual, nothing weird like that. I am talking about the oppression. Prison is a place of oppression. So even before the pandemic I was being oppressed. That's just the way it is, but I put myself here and so I have adapted to deal with that kind of stuff. I am a health man.</br></br> 

I am an inmate firefighter. I hike tall mountains, walk miles and miles with a fifty pound backpack on my back. I ran five miles everyday, do 1,000 pushups, and weight lift. So when the virus entered my body, my body was already ready to defeat it. So I won on that part, so far, so good.</br></br>

Mentally, I had that covered too because I am trained to go through battles in this world. I have always been a strong individual. Being in prison now is harder than ever. Visitation is over. That's tough, tough as steel. There are so many men who look forward to those weekend visits, and for them to just  be taken away is very tough on the human mind.</br></br> 

I personally don't have anyone to come and visit me. I don't have a girlfriend. My family is up in age and they don't drive long distances anymore, but I have learned to deal with that over the years. I am not going to lie, once I received your letter I was very happy to see a female name in the letter. I thought that I had finally got someone to write me.</br></br>

Visits and mail are the two big things you can allow prisoners to have. Now one of those is gone. Now you have to deal with communication in another way and that's the prison phones. People don't like writing anymore because the technology is so advanced now.</br></br>

People don't write. And a woman is not especially going to write. It takes a special woman to even sit down and entertain her thoughts and what she is feeling, put all that down on a piece of paper, lick the envelope and send it. I don't have those types of privileges. It makes me feel really good that someone believes in me, that has never met me.</br></br>

And I am going to end this letter by saying this letter from helped me cope. That's how we cope by getting mail from people who haven't forgotten the forgotten. If I could get another letter from you, that would be all the energy I need to get through this crisis. We just want to hear that people like you care.</br></br> 

You could never understand what I am going through because you would have to be living it to understand. Just know this living with COVID-19 in prison is like being punished twice. You are already incarcerated, and now you are living with a virus. It can mess with your psyche a little.</br></br>

Now that I don't have much longer to go in prison I am more able to deal with these kinds of things much better. I am just so excited about getting out soon that I don't even think about testing positive for COVID-19. I have enjoyed writing these words. I hope that I have shared a lot and you can get an idea how I feel.</br></br> 

I am OK. I can beat this virus. I can do all things through Christ Jesus who strengthens me. I hope that I can hear from you again. Until then take care.</br></br>

Yours truly.
