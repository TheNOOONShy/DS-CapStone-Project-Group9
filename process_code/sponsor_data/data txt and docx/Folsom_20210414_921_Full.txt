Whom ever reads this letter, hello, and because the letter I received was signed by (redacted), hello to you. My name is (redacted), from Compton California, and I’ve been incarcerated since September 2012. During that time I have seen and experienced many different things on all sides of the spectrum.</br></br> 

So when this COVID 19 pandemic hit the US, we all figured will be relatively unaffected in prison. In my mind, I thought we were one of the safest populations due to the minimal and limited contact with the outside. Boy was I mistaken. Turns out we’re one of the most vulnerable. Well, at least one of the most vulnerable here in California.</br></br>

Primarily because of the crowded institutions and the way our programs are structured for yard, chow, were assignments etc. Most things are done in massive. But that is only relevant with spreading the virus. The only contributions factors for contracting the virus was the prison staff.</br></br>

The virus was introduced, it spread like wildfire. To be fair, old (redacted) State Prison was not designed, and not equipped to deal with something like COVID 19. The measures taken by staff to combat the spread of the virus were-futile and few in between as a whole sent out the new guidelines state wide. It appeared to have the right intentions.</br></br>

For the US here in (redacted), things have finally become better. We’re still on a modified program, which ,means we’re on lockdown in all but name. Currently, I'm in administration segregation, the hole, and we seem to have more recreational time then the general pop. We are all in single men cells, here in ad-seg, and have individual walk alone yards. You would think us safest from exposure right?</br></br>

On the contrary, we are put at risk almost daily. The building where we are housed in has three floors. Each floor has two tiers running parallel. (redacted) are used for ad-seg inmates. (redacted) is used to house the positive COVID cases. So if and when an inmate tests positive from anywhere in the prison, they are housed in (redacted).</br></br>

For ten to 14 days, doesn’t sound bad on paper right? Except for number one. Prison staff make their rounds and walk through all three floors at their pleasure, cross contamination. Number two, inmates in ad-seg must be escorted at all times. There is no establishing order as to who escorts who, so we are unable to get escorted physical holding or grabbing us.</br></br>

By staff assigned to (redacted). Number three, everyday on our way or to the walk alone yard, we must pass by (redacted). Let me mention that where we are housed, there are no solid doors to our cells. We have opened bars and mesh gates. Number four, there isn’t very much adherence to PPE and sanitation rules by staff.</br></br>

They’ll put on a pair of gloves and touch anything and everything, and handle our food, laundry, and personal property. Since CDCR first cancelled all visits, we were supposed to receive phone calls more frequently to keep in touch with family and loved ones. Not much has improved in the regard for those of us in ad-seg, we are entitled to one call a week. But are only receiving calls once every two to three weeks, depending on the mood of staff.</br></br>

Some staff purposefully run calls at inconvenient hours to create difficulties for some inmates. Or they run the calls in random order and so skip some of us. It’s incredibly frustrating we have filed 602 complaints, but have seen little relief. It may appear inconsequential to an outside, but I assure you it is not. I have not seen my family in over a year. Finances aren’t great so I can’t call collect as often as others, and the mailroom staff here.</br></br> 

Are by far the most inefficient, and unorganized. An incoming letter takes anywhere from two to four weeks to reach us. Your letter is postmarked March 2021. So there is an obvious strain on my family and my relationship with my wife has deteriorated. The prison advertises video visitation but has yet to inform us how to apply for one or how our family can register.</br></br>

Perhaps from the outside, it may seem things are as well as can be but it is an accumulation of inconveniences that makes things difficult for us inmates. I understand prison is my punishment and I am reminded of that almost daily, but the lack of effort by staff and the unaccountability of their mismanagement and during the pandemic, is not part of the judges sentence. Lastly, you ask how are the vaccinations going for us. I don’t know how general pop is fairing, but Here in ad-seg I have yet to see anyone be offered the vaccine.</br></br>

I hope that this letter provides some sort of help in some way. It is inspiring to know that you guys are having the conversations out there and have us in the mind. I don't claim I understand your goal or your aim but I hope you guys achieve and acquire what it is you’re after. If I knew of a better way to help and contribute, I would gladly do so.</br></br>

 With said if you need any further assistance from me all you've gotta do is ask. You mentioned in your letter something about art I'm not sure what you guys have in mind but on my Instagram account (redacted), run by a relative, you can see what I can do.  If you guys have a specific request, i’ll be glad to help. Hope to hear back from you guys.</br></br>

Goodluck with everything and God bless.
