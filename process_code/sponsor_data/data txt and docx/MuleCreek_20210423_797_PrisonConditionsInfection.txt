This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Mule Creek.</br></br>I received your letter today. You know, it really made me happy. This place truly sucks during any time we're going through. So, the COVID was just stress. To be blunt the officers in my building didn't give a [redacted] about us.</br></br>A lot of the inmates wouldn't take the precautions seriously so they wouldn't wear masks, continued to shake hands and some of these dudes passed out our food. And when these dudes came up positive the cops still let them run around and do whatever.</br></br> I'd say about 45 inmates out of about 200 didn't test positive (me and my celly included), I made sure everything that came in my cell got stripped and scrubbed with soap and water.</br></br>We wouldn't eat anything that wasn't sealed, and we washed the packaging. It was so frustrating because these officers are in charge of checking these inmates to wear masks and lockdown the ones who test positive and they'd let them run around and carry on.</br></br> If I say something I got to be ready to fight, 'cause how I'm telling someone what to do, it could be taken as disrespect real easy. So, I'm stuck at staying out of trouble and not getting sick.
