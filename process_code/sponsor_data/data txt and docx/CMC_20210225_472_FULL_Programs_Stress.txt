Hey first I hope this letter also reach you both physically and mentally in the best way possible, as for me I'm doing okay now.</br></br>

See how I'm holding up in here, it is very difficult in here at the moment. We are on a very strict program, before the COVID name to this prison we were getting four hours of yard, visits, jobs, school, programs, church set. Now we getting one hour of yard maybe. We are cell food and the food always get mixed up with each other.</br></br>  

Because they serve us with like a fake out food tray. So solid be in my jell-o or cake, gravy be all over my food. It's annoying to be honest. I haven't seen my family in over a year now.</br></br> 

I've also had the coronavirus since I've been here and that was scary. People was dying and calling for help and it takes at least 10 to 15 minutes before a nurse even makes it to your cell. They took the workout area away. It's basically no program at this prison.</br></br>  

Some people that's in here who been down 30 to 40 years can't deal with it. Me I'm okay at times, I'm almost done with my time.  Also there is no way for us to get credits for time reduction because no program. So yeah it's frustrating.</br></br> 

But I really appreciate you believing in me, prison is not for the weak. What's in here and out there family, friends, and lovers always leave you in here to struggle alone and the COVID made it worse. But I'm as solid as it gets I might bend but I will never break.</br></br>  

If you do post this letter on your website I want people to know who wrote this letter. So you can go on my social media if you want and attach a picture of me to my letter because I think this is a wonderful awareness to everyone. Thank you so much. God bless and be safe.</br></br>

Thank you, PrisonPandemic.
