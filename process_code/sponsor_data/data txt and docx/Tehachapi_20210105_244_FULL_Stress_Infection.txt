This letter was written by a person incarcerated in Tehachapi.</br></br>

All our years, rabies shots to attend school grounds and drink a pink milk carton. For our learning to not understand the race production, telecast, networks, different parts of the world. A European as handsome as it sounds we have no vaccine that injected in the body terms of the encyclopedia, dictionaries of televises to hear.</br></br>

It’s normal to stay away feel safe, or gather around what makes you feel normal. And hear and see the human race has to walk around with a face mask and not see our teeth or maybe whisper with a quick nod.</br></br>

I believe the facial feature is attractive and also maybe a getaway enjoy what can come off, serve, delight, and help yourself. It’s a strong thing to see our world suffer January 200. The Pfizer vaccines are being delayed.</br></br>

How much is used before they throw it away of what's concealed throughout. The needle, the practice nurse and how long the way, principles, doctrines and mental support of all human history. It’s abnormal enjoy my daily living of what I was raised on and continue the process a vaccine.</br></br>

A number, a smell, a dose, a tick, maybe a morphine, a sedater, smell, or taste. It’s respiratory, lungs, nasal, and deep breaths. I wouldn't know how to graph or correspond on terms of COVID-19, and what it means to me in a different time like this of what the world is living right now.</br></br>

Incarcerated is being in jail away. Shut away certain rules to understand and know why we understand the way we do. COVID-19 sounds harsh, man made. It’s in the air, it’s in mass and matter.</br></br>

Thing why certain people died throughout the world history. Labeled facts, prints, statements, and book written. It’s ugly throughout the world. It’s pretty in some lands. It’s painful in operations and it's slightful for interesting.</br></br>

People in some padding colorful, thick, or thin, a nice respiratory onset to not smell. I'm comfortable, I enjoy my aroma pleasant. I’m to myself, I prefer being alone, no problems. To sit back and understand the world is doomed.</br></br>

Incarceration is a long time for my sentencing of what I was sentenced to. A carjacking conviction of by the people, five to seven ruling lesser crime of carjacking. No guns were found but to sit there hear write man convicted me of losing trial sentence of 20 years. No guns, no witness.</br></br>

To commit to prison for my wrong, is difficult for a human. A person in the world and everything we studied.
