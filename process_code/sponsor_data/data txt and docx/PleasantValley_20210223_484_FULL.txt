Dear PrisonPandemic,</br></br>

Hello mija, how are you doing today? I hope and pray just fine. And these few lines find you, and all those that concern you strong in mind, body, and spirits. As for myself, I’m okay.</br></br>

Taking one day at a time, remaining positive and focused as much as possible. Each day moving forward.</br></br>

First and foremost, it was both an honor and pleasure to meet you. And I can’t thank you enough for taking the time to share in your concern about me and what we’re all going thru in here at PVSP. Honestly, I don’t even know where to begin.</br></br> 

I guess I can start by telling you a little about myself and some of my experiences.</br></br>

I say some 'cause if I told you all of it I’d be writing you a book long story. So, I am a young half a century year old, but my spirit is twice that and my disposition is that of the sun. Bright and full of light.</br></br>

I’m a single father of four and a grandpa of six. I’ve been incarcerated for 26 years. I have eligibility for parole date on September 4, 2024.</br></br>

I do plan on pushing it a lot sooner, so I’ll probably go back to board like 2022 or 2023. We’ll see. But again, I have to complete one or two things as well as continue to positive program.</br></br>

I have come a long way, and have made a complete 180 degree change in my life. Today, I have just about five years clean and I am 100 percent dedicated and committed to my sobriety which I am now going on four years, four months on. That might of sounded a bit confusing to you right?</br></br>

Well, the five years thing I was referring to was write-up free. Four that stands for basically rules violations. My first 20 years of incarceration I carried both a mindset and belief system of that of a gang member, and the same as I was from the day I committed my crime.</br></br>

Today, however I am on a Level four behavioral override, and have been since November 2017.</br></br>

I’ve been doing, and have been involved in various self help groups such as CGA, stands for Criminal and Gang Members Anonymous, NA, Prisoner of Peace, Substance Abuse Program. And Long Offender Program which carried r-six courses, such as Victim Impact, Criminal Thinking, Family Relations, Denial Management.</br></br>

And I also did a stint with (YAP) Young Adults Program that worked with at risk kids from the community.</br></br>

Each l-top course was three to six months, 225 hours each class. So like I mentioned, I am driven and determined and dedicated to my change. I look at it like if I can heal and change, then I can show all these youngsters coming up both in the system right now and hopefully once I get out there that anyone can change!</br></br>

Most are stuck on not knowing “How to?!” Well, I have, and carry that remedy, and it's looking right back at you! Hopefully, moving forward, I’ll get the chance to tell you my story, cause trust me, it is a very powerful one.</br></br> 

Well, let me get back on track. Okay, so on this COVID-19 issue; this is what happened to me, and what I experienced. It all started on November 19, 2020.</br></br> 

It started out like any other day, but it would not end that way. At 10 am that day, the nurses came into my block D-four, and tested me for COVID-19. They stuck a long q-tip up my nose that made me feel a little uneasy and disoriented. So, what I forgot to mention is, I have been battling pneumonia and valley fever since like July.</br></br>

So at 3 p.m. I was called to the D-yard medical to see a doctor. She goes to tell me that she wants to test me for possible TB. And at first I was like, "okay sure". But then she goes on to tell me that she wants to send me to the outside hospital, and immediately my antennas went up, and I said, no, absolutely not!</br></br>

I said, “You can test me here, on the yard, but I am not going to the outside of the hospital with the underlying health conditions that I have right now!"</br></br> 

So, she goes on to say she’ll see if she can test me here on the yard, but if she does, then I am going to have to be quarantined in my cell for seven days. I was perfectly fine with that, and I let her know that.</br></br>

So she sent me back to my cell, and said, she was going to order the TB test, and they’ll call me back once it comes from the pharmacy. So again, I go back to my block, and I jump in the shower. I’m in the shower for about five minutes and the CO in the tower tells me that they want me back at medical.</br></br> 

At the time, I don’t think too much of it, so I just throw on my shorts, and a blue shirt.</br></br>

Normally it's required to wear your blue’s at medical or you won’t be allowed in. Well, once I get there, the RN tells me I have to go back, and put my blues on, 'cause I have to go to (CTC) Center Treatment Clinic and they’re gonna do the TB test over there.</br></br> 

I looked at her, and I instantly knew she was lying, so I said, “no, I’ll wait here” for the test.</br></br>

She said, “stop, just go over there, they’re already waiting for you!" I was a little hesitant 'cause I felt it in my gut that something was fishy. And I even commented on that. The doctor stuck her head out of her office and I asked her, “what was going on?" She just dismissed me and said “go to CTC”.</br></br>

To avoid any problems, cause unnecessary attention, and/or have the COs come and escort me, I went ahead and followed directions. I got to CTC, and the RN had a COVID-19 test in her hand, and said, “You're here for a COVID-19 test and transport to the hospital.” I instantly said, “No, I'm not!"</br></br>

And just so you know, I already tested for COVID-19 earlier today in my block. I went on to tell her that I’m just here for a TB test! She basically ignored me, and the COs put me in a holding tank and told me to put on a plastic jump suit, and face mask.

I was pretty adamant at informing them that I cannot chance going out to the outside hospital. In fact I feared going out, cause I knew I’d be put into risk of contact.</br></br>

I refused, and referred, and refused, but my refusal fell on deaf ears, about 20 minutes into the back and forth. Finally the COs said, “Look, to avoid any unnecessary bs, just get in the van, so we don't have to spray you. Either way you will be going, and you can refuse once you are there."</br></br>

Again, the last thing I can afford is a write-up so that was what I was thinking and feared at that moment. So I followed directions like I was told, and dressed for transportation. All the way to the hospital I kept telling the COs that this was a bad idea, and I was being put at risk of catching COVID-19.</br></br>

They just kept saying, “You’ll be alright”.</br></br>

So, once we arrive, I did not feel right and I begged the COs to please don’t take me in there. But again, my pleas fell on deaf ears and they kept saying, "you’ll be alright, you're just gonna get a TB test, and you’ll be out of there." As we’re walk in, I’m escorted into a room in the ER and I swear, it was a scene out of a movie.</br></br>

There were people everywhere and it was packed. People were literally sleeping in the hall way, and make shift beds were side by side with plastic separating each person. It was both sad and scary all at the same time. So, I’m now in a back room with the two COs when a nurse who was nice and hella sweet came in and the first thing she asked was "what?", and “why?” I was there.</br></br>

When she finished reading my paper work, and realized what I was doing there, her jaw dropped, as she couldn’t believe that I was actually there for a TB test. Her exact words were, “you are kidding me, why couldn’t they administer the test at the prison?" My response was, as I looked at the COs was, “My words exactly?"</br></br>

So, it was around 10 p.m. when I was admitted. I was put in a room on the fifth floor with what I believe was a zero pressure room. So, the first couple of days went some what normal, they kept drawing my blood, having me spit in a little cup for like three days straight.</br></br> 

The only good thing was the food was hella good and it was the first time I had seen cable TV, specifically ESPN and FX.</br></br>

It has been like 26 years since I last seen ESPN, so that was cool. That really helped me keep my mind off of the circumstance I was facing. I thought that I would be okay considering the fact that I had my own room but I was only being naive.</br></br>

I had at least 10 people a day and night coming and going in, and out of my zero pressure room on the fifth floor. So there I was hoping and praying against all odd’s that I wouldn’t be exposed and have to fight for my life. It was not to be! On the day I was to be transferred back to PVSP, which was four days into my stay at the hospital.</br></br>

Oh! I almost forgot, I tested negative for tuberculosis which was the whole reason, and concern for the visit. I was administered a COVID-19 test, I explained to the nurse that I had started feeling a little sick and hot. They took my temperature and sure as all out doors, I had a high temp of 99.1.</br></br>

I was scared shirtless to say the least. One of the RNs that came in tried to instill some calmness and told me not to panic cause that will only make it worse. He said that he’s been treating just about everyone in the hospital that's tested positive and that those that remained both calm and optimistic got better faster and healed sooner.</br></br> 

And those that panicked got a lot more sicker, and worsened their situation.</br></br>

So, from that moment on I basically just tried to refrain from thinking negative and kept praying and talking to my higher power. I knew, if I stayed in control of what I can control I’d be a lot better off than not. So, I just put my big boy pants on so to speak and did the very best I could to leave it in God’s hands.</br></br>

I had a high temp. The night hot flashes. Cold chills made my night miserable. I woke up to a stomach ache and body aches that felt like I had gotten ran over by a truck.</br></br> 

I had diarrhea like Niagara Falls, nothing would stay down and I started to throw up pretty much whatever I ate that day. 

I felt, straight up, like I was going to die.</br></br>

But one thing I have learned about myself is, that I am a fighter. I was fighting for the wrong purpose, and for the wrong reasons most of my life. It was now on and for all the right reason to stay in this battle. All I could think about were my grandkids, and the special women in my life who I promised, I would never give up.</br></br>

Yes, it was an experience I would never wish on anybody, and it's been one pandemic that has changed life as we all once knew it. But it was one I weathered and made through only to come out stronger. On Thanksgiving Day around 9 pm I was released from the hospital and sent back to PVSP.</br></br>

Yes, I made it but I felt so different. I was still feeling symptoms, shortness of breath, and headaches. Not to mention confusion.</br></br>

Once back I realized the whole week I was in the hospital, D-yard was in disarray. And everybody who tested positive for COVID-19 was being moved into four block and those that we’re in contact were put into five block. The yard as we knew was on lockdown and program was now shut down.</br></br> 

The first week in three block, I couldn’t contact no one in my family. No phone or outgoing mail. Nothing!</br></br>

That changed about seven days in. I was now placed on a 20 day observation status. I was still experiencing some side effects but more than anything, I was really feeling very lonely. In all of my incarceration, and I have been through some tough situations and circumstances, trust me I have!</br></br>

This one was so different psychologically.</br></br>

My spirit was on zero and I felt so unsteady. The everyday normal activities were difficult and just plain hard to complete. So, every morning I clean my floor with a wet towel, which is what every man, in every cell in the state uses to clean their floor with anyways. That is something I do everyday and have done since day one, and well, I had a hard time doing that.</br></br>

I was breathing hard as hell as if I had worked out, when I stood up I lost my balance and was unsteady. I never felt like that. All I could think about was "why did the doctor, who well knew that, I had underlying health conditions still decided to send me out to get exposed?"</br></br>

So, about two weeks back, I received via prison-mail my results from the November 19th COVID-19 test and sure enough it came back negative. Surprise-surprise. Here I am, some three months later, and really trying my best to put my experience behind me. But I can’t help but still feel like I’m or we’re not out of the woods yet.</br></br>

I still feel wheezing in my lungs. I still feel shortness of breath. I still feel a little stressed and lonely throughout the day. But I strongly believe it's just a matter of time before we all get past it. It won’t last forever.</br></br>

I do want to thank you from the bottom of my heart for taking the time to share with me and let me know that there is people, regardless of the fact that we know them or not, who actually care about us in here. I can’t say it enough how much that means to us. I appreciate it to the end of the earth and back.</br></br>

And to all of you at UCI and the pandemic project, I tip my hat and I am so proud of you. That's right! Continue putting it down and pushing for what is right out there and in here. Take care, and may the main-main and women up above continue to shine bright on you as we all move forward.</br></br>

Long love and respects,</br></br>

PS, smile, your thought of the day- of today and always.</br></br>
