This story was told by a person incarcerated at Tehachapi.</br></br>

UCI: How are you handling this? It must be really stressful of course.</br></br> 

Caller: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. It's definitely, it’s definitely a frustrating situation. It’s, it can be very depressing. But, I mean, I just try to make the best of the situation by, you know, just trying to understand the situation and understand what I can control and what I can’t control, you know. </br></br>

UCI: And how about your family and your loved ones? What do they do? </br></br>

Caller: Well, I don’t write to them, they don’t write to me. We don't have any contact or visits so I haven't been able to see them since March. So, I call them, I call them occasionally, and they told me that I just found out that my niece is pregnant. She's due this month. And she's got the COVID. So that, you know, that worries me. </br></br>

UCI: Of course, of course.
