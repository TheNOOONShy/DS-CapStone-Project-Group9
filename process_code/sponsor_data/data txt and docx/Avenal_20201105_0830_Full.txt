This story was told by a person incarcerated at Avenal.</br></br>UCI: What facility are you currently housed at?</br></br>Caller: At Avenal State Prison.</br></br>UCI: Okay and what is the current COVID-19 situation at your facility?</br></br>Caller: Right now, it's pretty I mean minimal. What’s happening right now is you have a lot of the inmates who had tested negative previously, they’re testing weekly every Friday. And so, if any of those tests come back what they’re doing is they’re basically quarantining the dorm where the inmate lived who test positive.</br></br> 
And then the inmate who tests positive is moving to the three yard here, and then at Avenal State Prison, and then the rest of the dorm is being quarantined themselves on another yard, on the A yard, or alpha year. So, I mean it's just kinda, just all over the place. You know there doesn’t just seem to be any systematic thing and you know they seem to be in the stance of moving people kinda just willy nilly not based on anything.</br></br>
And kinda pretty much also going against what the CDC and the WHO have come out and said about you know quarantine being shelter in place and you know confined to quarters you know the CTQ that military uses you know when any of their you know military members have to be quarantined or confined to quarters you know. It doesn’t seem that the CDCR is doing that.</br></br>UCI: Right, and what do you think is going okay in your facility?</br></br>Caller: You know I think the way that they have the, well and then that’s the funny thing. See they have the, the yard's pretty well quarantined where you know we don’t go to chow together, we don’t have yard together, you know there's not any education going on where there's cross contamination you know. So, they work you know.</br></br>
They’ve done a pretty good job on that you know, on the yards, keeping the inmates separate. But then again moving and cross contamination through moving inmates between yards you know seems to be going against what they’re trying to attempt to do. So, I mean you know it there's nothing that seems to be consistent.</br></br>UCI: Right, and what is troubling or concerning to you personally?</br></br>Caller: Well to me it just seems that the way that they; instead of you know, like I said you know way back in March you know they shut everything down. So, the chapel was closed, the classrooms were closed, any of the vocations that were going on or any self-help groups that were going on where inmates were coming together from different buildings you know and in any you know large group setting was basically squashed you know. And to try to confine the spread you know, and masks were issued to all the inmates.</br></br>
And there was a point there where they-, there was a point there when they were you know bringing meals to the building to try to you know kinda stop the spread and stuff and you know it did spread pretty much like wildfire.</br></br>
And then you know they forgot that how widespread it’d gotten, and they just seemed to still just be moving inmates you know just it seemed willy nilly and not really doing the shelter in place and the confined to quarters that the CDC and the WHO has kind of instituted for the rest of you know basically the world you know. And you know if somebody goes out to work and gets infected you know they don’t want even those people coming back to their families you know.</br></br>
And so, they’re telling them to go and quarantine elsewhere until that 14 days is up so that way they can go back to their families and not infect everyone. And you know it just seems that the movement that they’re doing isn’t doing that and it's just cross contaminating the yards and keeping the pandemic going here.</br></br>UCI: Right and how is COVID-19, how was COVID-19 handled at your facility at the beginning of the outbreak so probably like around March, I would say, was probably the beginning of the outbreak, how do you think it was handled?</br></br>Caller: Like I said, I mean they immediately shut everything down you know. Nobody was going to chapel, so religious services were shut down, vocations and education were shut down. They started having you know each individual building go to chow you know separate from the other buildings.</br></br>
And then once that building was done with chow they’d wait until that building was completely back in their building before, they sent the other ones out. And then in between chows they’d be sanitizing the chow hall, you know, and trying to stop the spread of it and the cross contamination from, you know, each building. Which, you know, which I liked, and you know it seemed to be working.</br></br>
And you know whereas at first, they had started moving individual inmates or dorms or quarantining them, you know, when anybody tested positive. And then after that you know they stopped that, because or they’d bring them back because you know like the building that I'm in they, we had about 85% of our building of the population in the building test positive within the first you know, two months.</br></br>
And so, it just showed that if you leave the building alone, let everybody catch it and then you’re not going to have all these other you know positive people coming out later and just having the continued you know spread of it. Whereas you get, you let everybody confined, let everybody get it at once and then you know sure you might have you know and just like we’ve seen you know that there’s different levels of you know virus spread in individuals and it affects individuals differently.</br></br>
But the fact is that the more people that get exposed to it, the less likely you’re going to have cases lingering on you know throughout however many years it takes for this pandemic to stop. You know where there’s a, you know a, what is it they’re trying to get the inoculation or the for it, so people can’t get it anymore. So.</br></br>UCI: Yeah. Do you think it's being handled differently now? Or do you think it's been consistently the same from like the beginning of this?</br></br>Caller: No. No, I think cause for a while they stopped moving inmates. And then once it started to calm down a little bit then they started putting inmates in gyms on different yards. They started putting inmates in different buildings on other yards.</br></br>
And you know it just seemed like there was more of a likelihood of getting the cross contamination kinda that we’ve seen. Which puts not only the inmates’ health at risk but also puts the staff and you know any of the free staff who come out and you know the custody staff puts them more susceptible to catching it.</br></br>
You know when you have inmates from other yards coming over to your yard or you as a staff member being sent to another yard you know with inmates who you haven’t been exposed to or that you haven’t worked around.</br></br>
So, you know I don’t know I just think there’s been a lack of consistency and a lack of knowledge of what the World Health Organization and the Center for Disease Control has truly been trying to do. You know which is to stop the spread and you know it seems that the CDC has kinda taken their own interpretation of it and that’s kinda what they’ve been going with.</br></br>UCI: Right, right. And what would make the situation at your facility better do you think?</br></br>Caller: I think like they did for a while there where they just shut everything down and just stopped any you know intra-yard routes. You know where you allow inmates just because they’re exposed; like we had a situation here where an inmate there was a, there was the large outbreak going on in one of the other yards.</br></br>
And so, they were moving any inmates that tested negative to our yard. And you know and so this inmate was moved to one of the dorms in the building that I'm in and cause he had tested negative and yet before he left he was letting the staff there know that he wasn’t feeling well. And so, and yet they moved him anyways.</br></br>
And then upon moving him he moved to one dorm. And then two days later he was moved to the dorm that I was in. And then like three days later they take him over to medical and he ends up testing positive.</br></br>
And so, two days later they send him back-, they send him back to his yard after he had already exposed you know a whole building to and plus, he was out using the phones and he was interacting with other inmates. And so, and we understand how and not always wearing masks and so and we already understand, and we see from the news, and from everything that’s going on, from what we’ve experienced here how fast this thing spreads like wildfire and stuff.</br></br>
So, when you have one inmate who was over at a yard where they had a mass outbreak going on and just because this inmate tests positive you move him hoping he doesn’t test positive and then you have him less than a week later testing positive and then you move him back anyway. That just you know it just doesn’t make any sense.</br></br>
You’re putting a lot of inmates at risk and then plus the building that I was in was supposed to be the quarantine building for all the inmates that were 60 and over to come and kinda have this be the building. And so, and there were a lot of those who didn’t test positive when the first outbreak came.</br></br>
And so, you know you’re putting that at risk group to a higher risk by moving another inmate over who test positive when you when in the first place you were trying to protect those older inmates from catching the pandemic and or the virus.</br></br>
And so, it just shows a lack of consistency and a lack of knowledge of what to do. And I understand they’re trying to do as best they could but if they would truly look at what the CDC and the WHO were trying to do and how they were trying to stop the spread, they seem to be just you know lighting fire to the virus and letting it spread you know instead of trying to contain it within individual inmate groups you know and individual buildings.</br></br>
And so, you know I don’t know I just think the lack of consistency has been the most concerning you know and kind of the lack of care.</br></br>UCI: Right and how do you think the, COVID-19 has affected in your fa-; sorry, how has the COVID-19 situation at your facility affected your loved ones?</br></br>Caller: I just think there's some you know some added stress there. I mean with them already dealing with it out there and you know being locked down and seeing-, and kinda seeing the inconsistency that’s been going on in here. That’s kinda just been kind of I think concerning.</br></br>
You know when I talk to my parents or anybody in my family you know it just seems to you know that they don’t understand it but at the same point you know there’s not much you can do.</br></br>
But I mean kind of just look out for and try to take your own personal precautions that you can by wearing your mask and trying if you know that an inmate maybe has tested positive or you know or there's a situation, there's something you can do to try to protect yourself and others you know trying to take that standpoint.</br></br>
You know just to not be that spreader or be that person who you know affects somebody negatively. And just always kinda to reassure my parents too you know that I’m safe and you know I'm just trusting in what God’s doing here and you know, knowing that he’s in control of all things.</br></br>UCI: Right, right. I just want to say thank you so much for participating.
