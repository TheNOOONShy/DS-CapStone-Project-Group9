This story was told by a person incarcerated at Butte County Main Jail.</br></br>

UCI: What has the COVID situation been like at your facility?</br></br>

Caller: At first it was kind of, it was alright, they was allowing like, free calls and stuff, you know what I mean, we were able to contact our family. But then they took the calls away and shit. I currently like, I currently lost one of my cousins over the COVID flu. You know, it’s kind of depressing.</br></br>

They got us locked down, we're locked down like 22 hours a day. We ain’t getting really no phone calls or nothing, or really nothing really special here, you know? It’s kind of like making us act out and stuff, you know?</br></br>

UCI: Act out? Can you elaborate on that? What do you mean by act out?</br></br>

Caller: Like, you know what I mean, well we’re just bored, you know what I mean? So, you know what I mean? There’s like, we’re on a standstill, there ain't a lot of like, movement in here, you know what I mean. There’s a lot of assault on inmates, there’s - you know what I mean, assault on staffs. Shit like that.</br></br>

UCI: How is the staff taking care of you guys?</br></br>

Caller: They don’t really care. They don’t seem like they got any kind of like, empathy or anything, you know?</br></br>

UCI: Even the medical staff?</br></br>

Caller: Like, even medical staff. The medical here sucks bad.</br></br>

UCI: Oh. As in what way?</br></br>

Caller: Like - like, just as far as like, our medical like, for - for like measures, you know? I wear eyeglasses, I wear prescription eyeglasses. I’ve been here for four months and I can’t get an optometry appointment.</br></br>

UCI: Wow.</br></br>

Caller: You know, and I can’t see shit. You know what I mean? So, you know, there’s only so much to do ‘cause I don’t got medical insurance that'll pay for optometry. Like, I can’t see the TV from my cell. I can’t read a book because I can’t see shit. You know? They don’t care.</br></br>

UCI: How has the vaccination situation been like?</br></br>

Caller: I got the vaccination. I got the one where you only need one shot. I got it.</br></br>

UCI: Oh, the Johnson & Johnson one?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah. I got that one.</br></br>

UCI: What happens if an inmate says that they have COVID? How does the medical team respond to that?</br></br>

Caller: They - they will give, they will give you like, cotton swabs, you know what I mean? They’ll give you the COVID test. They really don’t, they really don’t give a shit about us. You know? Life's cheap in here, to be honest with you.</br></br>

UCI: Cheap as in?</br></br>

Caller: Cheap as like, they don’t give a shit.
