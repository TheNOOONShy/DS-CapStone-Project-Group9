Hello PrisonPandemic,</br></br>

May 9, 2021</br></br>

Well you have written me wanting to know what it's been like for us in here during the pandemic which has been rough. I had the COVID and thought I was gonna lose my life to it especially the way we were handled was not right. I can tell you that things are kinds looking up now but seeing everyone sick and just being around it was not cool, looked like some zombie stuff.</br></br>

Anyhow I don’t know exactly what all you guys are trying to know from me. The questions you have asked are about visits which I don’t get, we are on a lockdown to which is rough but us as inmates we manage. Anyhow sorry but I don’t know what else to say. 

Would be nice to hear back from you guys, God Bless and hope you and your families are okay with the pandemic and all take care.</br></br>

Sincerely.
