Now to speak on this Pandemic and the safety of those of us within these state institutions for there are people who have become infect with this contagious disease! And the institution’s head designee and its security force are acting as if we the prisoners are bringing this highly deadly microorganisms! </br></br> Now I personally have been blessed for I have not caught the virus, and I pray to the Heavenly Creator of all I know an all I don’t know, to keep on watching over me and protecting me! For at my age of sixty plus, Covid-19 could kill me. </br></br> For the medical quality within this very institution is not even adequate; now I’ve not heard of any prisoners dying; but I have heard that there has been some farther prisoners that have been hospitalized. </br></br> And practically every day there are on an average from one of the four yards, about twenty prisoners being quarantined for Covid-19! But the crazy part of all this is once people have been placed on farther day, obvious they are placed back around or in the same building as before! </br></br> But my point is once the individuals whom have been removed are replaced back in the same building there are new cases; so people are just being infected and Quarantined over and over again! </br></br>
