This story was told by a person incarcerated at Fresno County Jail.</br></br> 

UCI: What has the COVID situation been like at your facility?</br></br>

Caller: Well, they take me out, they take me out every day to go to court. And they test me in the morning, and I'm negative, and then they throw me back into an infected pod.</br></br> 

UCI: Mmhmm. Is there -</br></br>

Caller: Because the pod is on quarantine. Yup.</br></br>

UCI: And what is your - how has the vaccination situation been like at your facility?</br></br>

Caller: What's it like?</br></br>

UCI: Mmhmm.</br></br>

Caller: We're just slammed down all day. We don't get to, we don't get no activities or anything. Our calls are limited. We don't get no calls to call our family, our visits are cut off. Healthcare is really slow. It's just real bad.</br></br>

UCI: I'm sorry to hear that. And how have you been coping with the crisis?</br></br>

Caller: Off and on, it's odd because we've been on quarantine since March of last year at least four times. Including this one, about five times, I would say. And they give us vaccines, and then they just keep bringing people in off the streets and throwing them in the same pod with vaccinated people, and then it becomes an occurrence again.</br></br> 

And then, they test you, and if you're negative, they still continue to keep you in the same pod with positive people. It's just really backwards.
