Hello PrisonPandemic,</br></br>

Good morning to you and all those around and I want to thank you for reaching out to me with well wishes and concerning for our well-being. I received your letter last night in good health and spirits. I was very much surprised.</br></br>

First, we do not know each other and second I receive very little mail. But I’ll do my best to answer your questions and hopefully by the end of this letter you may gain some insight and something positive is gained. When I first heard of COVID-19 I was not worried because I was still in the county jail and information was very limited and it was not in the U.S.</br></br>

So the thought of it affecting my loved ones or myself was quickly dismissed. As it made its way to our country is when it became the talk of the jail and by March it was all anyone talked about. But the only information we got was news or newspapers. The biggest issue I had was I, like most people, I wanted to know if my family caught it would they die.</br></br>

And if they did, how would the jail handle it because that is my biggest fear, is to lose a loved one while being here. In the beginning that was the biggest issue was we all had questions with no answers. I hate using this word but as a inmate you are the very last to receive any notices. Most of the time we are just ordered to do something without any explanation like moving or changing your living situations.</br></br>

Oh and before I get to the part where we have to interact with C.O.s, please know that most inmates harbor hate and bad feelings towards C.O.s. I just want to make it clear that that is not me. I hate no one and understand that my actions are what lead me in here and for the most part the C.O.s are just doing what’s told to them. Most of them.</br></br>

By the time I arrived to prison which was Wasco State Prison in March 2020, we were told that all visits were no longer available. And at this time we were not issued any P.P.E. or instructions how to lower the spread of a virus that we know nothing about and that was the hardest part, was not knowing. While waiting to be housed in Wasco we were all placed in a cell, about 40 inmates per cell.</br></br>

But as I stated before this was in March and at that time the social distance was not implemented and if it was we did not hear of it yet. I received my first mask in the end of April but 95% of people did not wear them. We had to have them on our person but staff did very little to educate us on the importance of wearing them.</br></br>

A big thing with inmates is contact with friends and loved ones so a good thing the state did was at that time, twice a week we were given free phone calls. Something that has never been available before. But that was a huge help, it’s custom for inmates to complain about what they don’t have but very few are thankful for the little we do receive and that was such a huge blessing for me.</br></br>

I don’t have many people in my life but the few I do have I love them with everything I am. So being able to speak to them and know that they were well and handling the lockdown as best as they could was a small relief. So at that time the only way you could contact family was phone calls when the C.O.s let you out of your cell.</br></br>

And mail, the mail was a joke. One letter I received it took the prison 13 days to give it to me and I understand everything is slow but I thought 13 days just to receive a letter was mind blowing. And like I had mentioned for someone that receives very little mail, it was a big thing the rest of the inmates that were housed there were dealing with the same thing.</br></br>

As for as time out of the cell we were allowed about 40 minutes to shower and interact with each other. And we would get that once a day. The days we would have yard it would be around 90 minutes and we would receive yard twice a week. The same thing is given at the prison that I’m currently in now.</br></br>

Since my arrest in November 2019, I have not been out of my cell for more than two hours a day. So we all spend most of our time in the cell. When I first arrived here there was no COVID-19 cases and for the inmates it was impossible to catch it because we can’t come and go like staff is able to do. So once someone comes into contact with someone that has COVID, they shut the prison down.</br></br>

So that small time that we were allowed out that was no longer given to us. There was one month that were not given a chance to make any phone calls or shower. We managed to keep ourselves clean by showering in our sink. We call it bird bathing. So for us that was very frustrating. “But hey it’s prison,” some would say.</br></br>

This past February is when the prison went around to hand out a survey to see what we thought about taking the vaccine once it was available to us. At that time I did not know enough to want to take it and then to learn we could not work or go to school without taking it. So when the time came to take it, I said yes and as of March 5th, I’m fully vaccinated. And we were given Moderna vaccine.</br></br>

There still is a small amount of inmates that have not taken the shot but it’s not due to them not wanting to take it, they have to wait their turn. I know the prison was offering visits online so for those that do receive visits they could see and talk to their family through webchat once a month for 30 minutes. And the next step for visiting would be if you wanted a physical visit you have to be vaccinated and your family must take a COVID test 72 hours before coming.</br></br>

But most people have many questions about how CDCR will handle the visits. But it’s good to see that they are trying to have that available to us. Well I think I went on enough and don’t want to start rambling on.</br></br>

For myself this is a very hard time. There are moments where you feel alone or helpless but I think of all those who are really struggling or may have lost all they have and thank God that my health is the best it's ever been. And I know that there is light at the end of the tunnel.</br></br>

Oh as medical goes they treat us fair and from what I’ve experienced the medical staff here is very attentive. Since the time of my arrest I’ve not had one problem. That goes for the C.O.s as well. I can see that this pandemic has taken a toll on all of us. I’m not one of the inmates that takes anything personal when we don’t get something or we have to do a search. It’s prison and that’s just what happens.</br></br>

We were just told that if we wear our mask and it’s not properly, we will receive a write-up. So far I know of four inmates that have received them because they did not have the mask over their nose. And it does not matter if you took the vaccine or not. I think that is b.s. because everyone, staff included has done it and still do. But hey it’s prison.</br></br>

They are still doing free phone calls twice a month now and once a month for inmates who are indigent. You receive 20 stamped envelopes for free and for that I’m thankful. I am paying for a law that I broke and all this time stuck in the cell has really affected me in so many ways. One thing I realized is life is beautiful and I’ll always cherish the time I have left.</br></br>

Never again will take freedom for granted. Well it’s time for me to end this and send it out. I hope and pray for better days for the ones that have been impacted the worst. Thank you for your time, I hope it helps. If I missed something please forgive me, take care of yourself and those around you.</br></br>

Blessings</br></br>
