This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Mule Creek.</br></br>I received your letter today. You know, it really made me happy. This place truly sucks during any time we're going through. So, the COVID was just stress. To be blunt the officers in my building didn't give a [redacted] about us.</br></br>A lot of the inmates wouldn't take the precautions seriously so they wouldn't wear masks, continued to shake hands and some of these dudes passed out our food. And when these dudes came up positive the cops still let them run around and do whatever.</br></br> I'd say about 45 inmates out of about 200 didn't test positive (me and my celly included), I made sure everything that came in my cell got stripped and scrubbed with soap and water.</br></br>We wouldn't eat anything that wasn't sealed, and we washed the packaging. It was so frustrating because these officers are in charge of checking these inmates to wear masks and lockdown the ones who test positive and they'd let them run around and carry on.</br></br> If I say something I got to be ready to fight, 'cause how I'm telling someone what to do, it could be taken as disrespect real easy. So, I'm stuck at staying out of trouble and not getting sick.</br></br>Anyway, I lost my cousin during this crap, and we grew up together. We're 20 days apart so he was probably my longest friend.</br></br> My wife got tired of waiting and left me for some douche. For the best though 'cause she didn't love me that much. It hurt a lot though because I depended on her. I base my whole life around her. I loved them both a lot.</br></br>I don't know what else to say. I'm curious about what kind of class the professor is teaching. I do want a female pen-pal just based on I don't want to be alone.</br></br> I parole next year, maybe even this year due to all the new laws. All and any new friends are welcome. I'm open and honest, good looking and in shape so I want to be a let-down.</br></br> But for real. Anybody who wants me to help them, I'm more than willing. Just strike me up a note and tell me what to do. You can email me now through J-pay.com.</br></br>Just go to their website and text me out a letter and send it to my name and COC number here at Mule Creek. I hope I helped out. Like I said I got nothing else to do. Write all you want.
