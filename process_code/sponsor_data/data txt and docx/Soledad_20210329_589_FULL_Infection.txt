To PrisonPandemic</br></br>

Writing back to let you know that I am 57 years old and I have been in prison since 1998. I am a level three inmate and have been level three since January 2020. Being in prison this time is the same as before for me. I feel safe because I am still alive.</br></br> 

I filed a complaint 602 to Sacramento, California because the federal warden put escape charges on me in 2008 when I was there in Olinger Federal Prison in Stockton, California. My son recently got killed and eaten in Visalia, California in November 2020. Death certificate on file.</br></br> 

Roland P Hill recorder in Visalia, Tulare, co. California. The federal warden’s name is John Hancock.</br></br>

As for visits I get to talk to my mom on the phone. The last time I got to see my mom in person once when I was in Corcoran prison. I got here last June from Sierra Conservation Center in Nevada.</br></br> 

As for moderna, I got two already. Almost everybody got to booster shots of moderna. I gave her your address to mr. Shady. He gave me some artwork, but it's only copies of artwork.</br></br> 

I hope that you like them. Well I'll let you. I hope escape from Olinger Federal Prison Stockton California helps your life.</br></br>

Love, </br></br>
