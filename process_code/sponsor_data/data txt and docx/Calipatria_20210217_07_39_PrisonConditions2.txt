This story was told by a person incarcerated at Calipatria.</br></br>

UCI: Is there anything that's troubling, or concerning to you that is happening at your facility, in terms of COVID?</br></br>

Caller: Mmm, not really, cause look. How can, how could've anybody been ready for this? You know what I mean?</br></br>

UCI: Mhmm.</br></br>

Caller: They're trying to do all they can right. I know like they're not perfect. Everybody's always complaining about stuff right.</br></br>

So, we're always looking at the negative side of things. And it's like, yeah, you could complain about this and that but really how, they're trying to do better. They're giving us yard like every four days maybe. And I know it's not much, but it's something, and you gotta be thankful for it. You know what I mean?</br></br>

And it's like, yeah, they're slowly trying to make things more accommodating for us. You know what I mean? They're not going to get back to normal, but then who's life is normal? Not even on the streets, you know what I mean?</br></br>

UCI: Mhmm.</br></br> 

Caller: So, yeah. There's a lot of things they could do that would help us out, but they don't know how it's gonna affect in the long run, you get me?</br></br>

I mean, what if they do open up the program and then this new strain comes along and then we all catch it and we die. I mean, then people are gonna complain about that. So, it's like, I don't know. Maybe I'm a really optimistic person.</br></br> 

And, and I just don't look at the bad side of things. You know what I mean?</br></br>

UCI: Well that's okay. You know, I'm glad that you feel as though, things are going as good as they can. I mean, that's good to hear, definitely. Is there anything that you, you know, these calls are recorded, is there anything that you want people to know about your experience?</br></br>

Caller: Mmm. Nothing really. I mean. I've been down 15 years. So, it's like, I've probably just seen it all and, you get me?</br></br>

UCI: Mhmm.</br></br>

Caller: Just, I don't know. This is, yeah. It's not that bad.</br></br> 

UCI: It's not that bad.</br></br>

Caller: Oh, I'm sorry if you're looking for like a sad story.</br></br>

UCI: No, no, I'm-</br></br>

Caller: Like it, yeah. It sounds like that's what you're looking for. But yeah, I can't.</br></br>

UCI: No, I'm glad that you are not having a bad time. That is not what I'm looking for. I-</br></br>

Caller: I know.</br></br>

UCI: You know.</br></br>

Caller: It's not, like my whole family caught COVID. They all got COVID right now. Right?</br></br>

UCI: Mhmm.</br></br>

Caller: And we make fun of it. We're like, oh, hopefully you guys ain't dead. You get me? And then we'll, we just talk shit.</br></br> 

But, for, I guess I come from that type of family. So, it's pretty hard to- and yeah, I know what you guys are looking for.</br></br> 

I guess. If you guys are looking for reasons to complain and talk shit about the prison system, and this and that, yeah, I know it sucks but as far as the COVID situation, it's not that bad.
