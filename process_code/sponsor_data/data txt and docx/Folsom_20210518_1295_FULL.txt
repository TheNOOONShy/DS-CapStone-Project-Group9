Dear,</br></br> 


Hello there! I hope these few lines finds you and yours in the best of health and in high spirits. Well I received your little letter that you sent to me and I decided to write you back because you are an Anteater UCI. Ya I live in Laguna Hills off of the [redacted] parkway, on [redacted] street. My wife owned the house there so I figured I drop you a few lines.</br></br> 


So you want to know about how it is in here during the pandemic. Well I would have more rights if I was a chicken. Ya then the animal rights activists would be picketing outside because my cage is too small. Ya my cage is five feet wide and nine and a half feet long and that is for two people. Although I don't have a cellie, but a lot of guys do.</br></br> 


They tell us to social distance, but there is no way nor no room to do so. If i was a chicken they would fight for me to be free range. To social distance properly in here, they would have to have one person in every other cell to social distance right, but you know they aren't going to do that. I caught COVID, well they gave it to me. Ya the cells have bars on the front of them, so basically it's open. So we tried to hang sheets up so we, well I didn't breathe everyone's breath who walked by, but they said that wasn't allowed.</br></br> 


I am a heart patient. I had an open heart surgery in [redacted] hospital. I had valves replaced. So I was trying to be cautious and not catch it. The cops here just said if we catch it and die it is just population control. Basically that we would be doing society a favor. I am still having complication from COVID. But again if i was a chicken, people would picket for me to be free range.</br></br> 


I haven't taken the vaccine due to the fact that I was having complications and was taken by ambulance to the ER and the doctor told me in the ER that since I already had covid that he didn't feel I needed the vaccine. Plus it was tested on bovene on swine and that is what my valves are. Plus if I take the vaccine here and it rejected my heart valves and it put me in cardiac arrest, these people would not save me, they would let me die. So I refuse to take the vaccine here due to my safety.</br></br> 


Well, I am going to cut this letter off, I don't want to bend your ear to much. You be good and stay safe. Go Anteaters. If you want to write to me I am here.</br></br> 


Respectfully.
