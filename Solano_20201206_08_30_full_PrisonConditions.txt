This story was told by a person incarcerated at Solano.</br></br>

Caller: Hello. I am currently incarcerated at Solano State Prison.</br></br>
So here at Solano State Prison, at one time we didn’t have any positive tests, for people who had corona, or we might’ve had one here or one there. But as of late, they sent inmates here who had tested positive at other institutions, and so a lot of people think it’s those inmates who have come here that had test positive before, and still had it.</br></br>Me personally, I really and truly feel like it’s the staff. The staff is running in and out of buildings, searching, bothering people, and just this regular interactions. And so we’re - we’re beginning to have outbreaks. Building 24, building 2, building 16. They had cleared the buildings all the way out because people are testing positive.</br></br>So it’s finally here. So I just wanted to call you and tell you that. That’s what’s going on here, at Solano State Prison.
