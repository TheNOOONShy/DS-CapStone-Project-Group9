Because of the pandemic the program (movement) is at a halt. This means that I’m locked into a cell with someone who may not be able to cope with the pressures that relate to being in a pandemic.</br></br> Since March, I’ve had three cellies. The last two wanted to take their frustrations out on me. The current one is just as frustrated as the last two.</br></br> I want to rest but I can’t. I pray daily just to be able to get through that day without any incident. Besides the mental breakdowns from cellies, I’ve got to focus on not catching COVID-19.</br></br>  Yesterday we finally got a chance for phone calls. After seeing the sanitation efforts through the window, I declined to call home because I didn’t want to jeopardize my health and safety. By the way, I’m a chronic hypertension patient and being an older African American man, I don’t have room to gamble.</br></br> We are allowed to shower every three days. However, this too is a gamble.</br></br>
