This story was told by a person incarcerated at Santa Rita Jail.<br></br>

Caller: Okay, so like I said, this is my first time in jail. And when we first came here, we were getting six hours of pod time a day. And then -  and then they moved different classifications with us, like protective custody, and medium mental health and maximum mental health.<br></br>

So now, our pod times are stretched out a lot more. We get one hour out a day, once a week and we get, wait so, we get two hours out a day and about two days a week we only get one hour out a day in morning time.<br></br>

And we get served our food inside the jail, inside our cell, I mean. We don’t have any rec time, we're not able to go outside. And yes.<br></br>

UCI: Have you, have they mentioned if they’re going to allow you all to go outside anytime soon?<br></br>

Caller: I know we’re able to come out to the basketball court that’s in the little, in the rec yard. We get to come out for about a hour, an hour once a week on Saturdays. But I noticed there’s a big yard outside with a gym, and since I've been here, I haven’t been able to go outside to use any of the workout equipment or anything, since I've been here.<br></br>

I’m a diabetic and I feel like the food here is not – is not that - is not good for us. I’m having a lot of low blood sugars and stuff. I’ve been to the infirmary a couple times for blood sugars. And yes.<br></br>

UCI: And so how has the experience with medical been then?<br></br>

Caller: They’re nice, they’re nice and everything. The only thing it’s just the certain food we get is just not good for diabetics, I think. That’s from, just in my experience. But, yeah.<br></br>

UCI: Have you been able to get access to any sort of medication that would help you?<br></br>

Caller: I just, I take my insulin. I just take certain shots. I take a shot before I eat every meal and I take a long-lasting shot at nighttime. To keep my blood sugars stable.<br></br>

UCI: And you've been able to get that okay through the staff?<br></br>

Caller: Yes. I am - I get - it’s pretty okay.
