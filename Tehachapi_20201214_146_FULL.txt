This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Tehachapi.</br></br>

Mr or Mrs. UCI Student,</br></br>

May I begin by answering your unexpected letter? Sure made me laugh. Thank you for that service and I did need it.</br></br>

Thank you for asking, but my health is well. I hope you’re in good health yourself.</br></br>

I laughed since you have no clue that 2020 will be memorable for myself and with no fiction, just facts. Here’s why.</br></br>

It all began, give or take, in January or February, give or take, of 2020. While I was on D yard, A level, where they have 164 people in one dorm, Tehachapi.</br></br>

Everyone began getting sick. We thought it was a bad cold, going around until an old man who slept across from me wound up getting so bad, they took him to the hospital. I touched his forehead, and he was burning up, fever.</br></br>

So in a short time, the whole institution was sick. All five yards. That’s a minimum of 5,000 inmates. They even ran out of throat lozenges.</br></br>

Now in April of 2020, about 10 percent worked and said the following people, pack up your stuff. You’re going to C yard. Because we have to keep you guys separated as best as we can.</br></br>

So about three hours later, I was in C yard, in a cell by myself. Mind you, I like it because a room with 164 people compared to one by myself, I like silence, so I’m cool.</br></br>

As time goes on, I began hearing about COVID-19 and I stay on the news every morning - I turn on my TV and that’s all it’s about.</br></br>

So the fellas and I began talking and came to the conclusion that in January, February, that’s exactly what we had and I know you did.</br></br>

So as time goes on, the correction officers tell us that the yard I was on is uninfected. It went to E yard and so on.</br></br>

So time goes on and I go to my annual committee and my level has dropped so they feel me up for transfer, but because of COVID, all transfers were stopped.</br></br>

Once again, time goes on and transfers start again. And I’ve been in two block doing just fine, but the correction officer tells me, pack up, I’m going to block for transfer and I have to be there for two weeks and test COVID-clean, negative to get on this bus to transfer.</br></br>

Now, get this, block one is used for the COVID block, for people who have it! Yes, why would they want to send me there when all they have to do is test me while I was in two block. Never made no sense, but can’t tell these people nothing. Plus, I’m saving myself from an ass-kicking. So I move.</br></br> 

So I’m there for 18 days. In October of 2020, they put me in block one, 18 days later, I get tested in November 2020 for transfer.</br></br>

The test was the 15 minutes test and I came back positive for some reason. I say no reason because the entire block one was completely empty, just five of us in there only. That was the same day for transfer.</br></br>

We all tested at the same time and I’m the only one that came back positive. To me, it was a bunch of bullshit. Us five guys together - cut it out!</br></br>

Since I missed that bus, I waited for two more weeks and then I was ready to transfer again, so they tested me again, and again, I tested positive. And this time being in there so long, I got it since they began bringing people in who have it so I had no choice but to get it. When I was in block two, I was just fine.</br></br>

They tested me about six times, and when it came back positive. They would come back two days later and take a real test, send it to the lot on the streets and it takes three to five days to come back. And they all come back negative except for the last one.</br></br>

I believed it because I got a fever from hell that night, hot, super hot, like all my friends back in February, but it was gone the next day. Then I got a sore throat and then I lost my taste. I’m barely getting my taste back now.</br></br>

I strongly believe that these people putting me in block A, the block they use for COVID, I got it. They should have left me in block two and transferred me and tested me there. There I was just fine. Have no money for an attorney or I would have got one because I know they’re doing things incorrectly.</br></br>

They began test the entire yard because staff brought it in and inmates tested positive, so now the building one block is full of positive inmates.</br></br>

Since I’ve already been in block one for two months already and all transfers have been stopped, again, since COVID is so high out there, these people moved me back to block two. Awaiting transfer again. So when I’m ready to transfer, again, back to block two, they want to move me to block one and do it again. That’s where we will have a problem.</br></br> 

I’m not going back to block one ever again for them, to make me get it again. Won’t do it. They moved me back to block two in December of 2020. I have all these dates in my mind because I know these people are incorrect in what they’re doing to me.</br></br>

Now what would make you say you know I have what it takes to get through it! You don’t know me at all.</br></br>

Since 2007, I’ve seen plenty, but it’s prison! From assaults, stabbing, and so on, the saddest was seeing that kid hanging from when I walked by, gray and dead. 22-year, old kid. He couldn’t take it in his young mind.</br></br>

I’ll be 59 in January. I’m diabetic. I was a little concerned because I am diabetic, so I already got it and the nurse tells me I’m asymptomatic. Oh, well, I guess I made it through another war.</br></br>

You ask about safety in here! They don’t care because if staff can go home everyday, they’re the ones who bring it in and that’s the truth. We stay here.</br></br>

The visits are not reduced. Get it right. There’s no visits and there haven’t been any since February or March. Hardly no yard. They do and run the prison the way they want to and blame it on COVID.</br></br>

I know I have a hernia and it’s been four months. They tell me we can’t take you for x-rays because of COVID. Shit. They take x-rays on B yard. No need to go to the hospital. They’re full of shit.</br></br>

Safety in here. Stop playing. You’re more in danger. But the correction officers pass them to the inmates, and that’s the truth.</br></br>

I’ve been in since my daughter’s mom was pregnant and now my daughter is going on 14 years now, and her and I get along well. She’s used to seeing me and likes me. Dad, when can I see you and of course, I get upset. But her and I have long conversations about COVID-19.</br></br>  

So she’s very aware of it as well of its seriousness.</br></br> 

So all I do is, is tell her like this, okay, little mama, that’s what I call her. You’ve been there all of this long time now and all you have to do now is wait two more years and I’ll be home and she tells me, “Okay dad, like that is not long.” I parole in January. I do tell her that it’s not that long.</br></br>

I tell her to keep her mind on her home studies and yes, I’m very proud of her. She gets As and Bs, so I’m cool.</br></br>

Okay, my new student buddy, I’m sure you have your homework. I’ll end now so take care. Healthy and strong mind, I do have, haha. You have too.
