Salutations,</br></br>

Now this brief letter of expressive communication is to the student whom typed the letter of curiosity and concern for the wellbeing of those who are in these state prisons for committing a criminal act!</br></br>

Now to speak on this Pandemic and the safety of those of us within these state institutions for there are people who have become infect with this contagious disease! And the institution's head designee and its security force are acting as if we the prisoners are bringing this highly deadly microorganisms!</br></br> 

Now I personally have been blessed for I have not caught the virus, and I pray to the Heavenly Creator of all I know an all I don't know, to keep on watching over me and protecting me! For at my age of 60 plus, COVID-19 could kill me.</br></br> 

For the medical quality within this very institution is not even adequate; now I've not heard of any prisoners dying; but I have heard that there has been some farther prisoners that have been hospitalized.</br></br> 

And practically every day there are on an average from one of the four yards, about twenty prisoners being quarantined for COVID-19! But the crazy part of all this is once people have been placed on farther day, obvious they are placed back around or in the same building as before!</br></br> 

But my point is once the individuals whom have been removed are replaced back in the same building there are new cases; so people are just being infected and quarantined over and over again!</br></br>

Now to speak on the visits and loved ones, I am walking this life sentence off by myself and I do not anticipate living for the next 16 years! But hypothetically speaking, even if I do, I will walk out of some prison straight into a retirement home.</br></br> 

Because I have lost contact with all of my family members, and more than a few have relinquished this corporal physical presence since I’ve been in prison from [redacted] 2012, and my first board date is after 2035! But if the new laws of 2021 has made any positive reform in mass incarceration and unjustified sentencing as well as priors and enhancements, then I may get out this year!</br></br>

But now my experience in prison life goes back some 43 years for this year, but not all at once; for I was 20 years old when I first came to prison, and I am still coming to prison for trying to better my life criminal ways! And now the state of California has told me to find a corner in a round room and wait to die of whatever comes up first!</br></br>

But the crazy part of this mess is my crime is of a nonviolent nature and it fits the category of a misdemeanor offense, but a crime still the same, so I am in no way saying that I am an innocent man, but I don't comprehensively understand how can the court, the District Attorney's office, and the Department of Justice full on believe that they are justified in using or manipulating the standard principles of the letter of the law for their own self purpose!.</br></br>

So this is why there is truly a need for justice reform, not just in the state of California, but in the whole of the United States of America. Because this is not just a Black thing or a Brown thing, this is a family thing, meaning the human race, but more the Have Nots! for if the laws only work for the 1/3 of humanity, then the rest of us are worthless in the eyes of the powerful, the rich and the famous!</br></br>

Now the only thing I've ever wanted was equal chance to achieve prosperity in education, in financial gain, and in life in general! For I never wanted anyone to take care me from the time I was thirteen, so I resulted to the criminal life for prosperity blissfulness and peacefulness of mind and spirit. And now I sit in a concrete cage wondering if I will ever walk as a free man again, for the clock of life is ticking away!!!</br></br>

I feel that I'll never see any of my loved ones again, and I'll never get the chance to see my only child or my only grandchild, because the courts or the Department of Corrections won't do the right thing and let me go, because of this prior the first going back to 1979 and the other going back to 1985, two crimes I've already served time on after, but I am now serving time for once again and from what I've learned, pertaining to the law that constitutes double jeopardy, which is to twice serve time for the same offense!!!</br></br>

And on that statement, I will now bring this letter to a close, and I hope it meets the standard of your approval.</br></br>

Oh, and if you wish to use my name, please feel free to do so, and my name is just as it is on the envelope, or you can use [redacted] or keep it anonymously.</br></br>

Sincerely and truly.</br></br>
