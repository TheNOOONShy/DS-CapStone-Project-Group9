Hello UCI,</br></br>

Well I’m writing in concern about your wonderful letter that I got today. Thank you so very much for taking the time to write to me, I really didn’t believe that anyone did care about us behind these walls. Yes, that’s how I see it! But I was so very surprised.</br></br>

Well first of all, I do want to wish you all out there the very best of health! And may everyday be very special for you all. And I want to say I don’t mind if you use my name, it's okay.</br></br>

Well here's how it is behind these walls. We must all wear a mask, and we couldn’t have visits from our family, and they just started to give us our COVID shots which I’m happy to get that, and it’s really been hard on all of us. They had a lot of guys who tested positive for COVID and I don’t know what they did to them.</br></br>

But come on now, these officers had to bring that on to us. We never got to get out!! These officers, I mean the higher up ones, have no regard or respect for us. They treat us like animals here. I find myself trying real hard not to commit suicide. Yes, it’s been really hard on us, yes some guys did take their life, and as for me I’ve locked up since 1981.</br></br>

My case, under SB. 261, I was under age, but the CDCR does not recognize that, so they do everything they can to keep a person like me locked up. I’m being disrespected and discriminated, due to I am a person, who has tried everything possible to be a good person, and stay out of trouble. I was a gang member, but I gave that all up, I’m just all by myself.</br></br>

I gave my life to our wonderful God who has changed my life around and I thank him everyday for that, but all I do is show everyone respect. I don’t care who you are, but as far as my gang, they are the most hated hang in the prison. Bulldogs they have war with everyone, so everywhere I go I must explain myself.</br></br>

Like right now, we are still under strict movement due to COVID and hopefully we will get our visits where we can see our loved ones!! For more than one hour, yes that is I was told and they refused to let my uncle in to see me. He’s real old. I got him and my sister in my life and I’m mentally ill.</br></br>

I have real bad mental problems, I hear voices, see things other people don’t see, that's what I’m told. They sent me to state hospital a few times where I was getting better treatment. It really did seem like I was getting better. But then it all stopped the prison wanted me back in a cell so they could mistreat me and do as they wanted.</br></br>

I dream things that I hate to remember and as I’m writing this letter I’m having problems. And all they want to do is drug me up and lock me in a cell with someone who doesn’t care about me and disrespects me. I tried to tell them but they told me if I don’t live with him I’ll be given a 115, which is a write up.</br></br>

And they can take time away from me and they can take away yard time and phone time and I need my yard time and phone time. They mean a lot to me because I need to go outside and walk and think and get away from the voices. They are always bugging me day and night. I get up so paranoid everyday, since I’ve been back from the state hospital.</br></br>

I’ve been trying to get help for my mental problems. I can’t sleep or eat but I try my food and I got guys in here following me around and it’s not good. They don’t even want to give me help, they tell me “you’re just crazy.”</br></br>

They think it's a joke, my life doesn’t matter to them. I’m just a paycheck to them as long as they keep me alive!! Yes I've tried to kill myself, but they keep bringing me back to the world. I have really bad seizures and I end up messing my body up. I’m all messed up.</br></br>

They keep trying to give me different kinds of seizure medication that work to control my seizures but no, they want to try different meds to see what it does. I’ve already had three different surgeries due to my having seizures, right now I might be having another surgery due to my seizures.</br></br>

I fell down some stairs due to having a seizure. Yes believe me I hate it real bad. I've even had seizures in my cell and my cellmate didn’t even help me out. He told me I looked like a fish that came out of water, he thought it was funny. I couldn’t believe that a person would have fun seeing a person who’s sick.</br></br>

Yes I’m glad to have someone to talk to out there. Thank you so very much. Nobody believes what happens behind these walls. I even seen cops beat down a prisoner here and they get away from it all. I’ve been beaten up by these officers and they would call the nurse and tell her “look what he did to himself.”</br></br>

I would try to tell the nurse what really happened but they would think I was lying. They always take the cops' side in here, so they would write their report saying I wanted to hurt myself! Right then that night I was so scared I didn’t want them to take my life, so I did it myself.</br></br>

I tried to hang myself but I didn’t know the nurse was coming to see me to give me some papers to sign, that’s my luck. So she called the cops they took me down, and they told me when they’re ready they'll make it look good. I just laughed at them, I told them I’m ready anytime.</br></br>

Yes, it doesn’t really matter to me. I’m tired of this kind of life here. Because I feel in my heart they don’t want to let me go home, so I ask our Lord almighty to please forgive me, “for all my sins and to please open up his arms and let me come home to him!!” Yes, that's all I want. I’m going through so much pain!!</br></br>

Well I do send my respects to you and the people who work to get our side out!! Thank you.</br></br>

Your friend always.
