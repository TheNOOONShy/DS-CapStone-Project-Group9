This story was told by a person incarcerated at Centinela.</br></br>

UCI: And so what has the COVID situation been like at your facility?</br></br>

Caller: It’s - in what regard? Well, for the first, I’ll say the, let’s see, I got here in October, and it was basically lockdown all the time, and then we would get, you know, we would get popped out for a shower, for like a five minute shower and that was real rough, you know.</br></br>

But, so really, no dayroom, no yard. But then just over like the last month and a half or so, they started doing things differently and they're starting to give us yard, stuff like that.</br></br>

But, I mean, considering, you know, the whole mask mandate, it kinda sucks and everything, but you know, I just got my COVID vaccine, so my second shot. So I mean, considering what’s going on, you know, I mean, I don’t feel like, well you know, actually I’ll pick it up.</br></br>

Before the vaccine, I felt like holy shit, you know, this could be the end, you know. This is how I’m going to go out, you know, unfortunately. But then, after I got my vaccine, you know, they finally started administering - administering the vaccines.</br></br>

I feel safe now, you know. At least I have a, you know, a crutch. But yeah, the whole pandemic’s been pretty shitty. It kinda wears on the soul, you know.</br></br>

I can only imagine it’s worse for the guys who are doing life and shit like that, you know. But for myself, my mother, father passed away already so my sister was really all I had left, her and my little niece.</br></br>

And then my sister back in October, actually on Halloween, died and she was eight months pregnant. So her and the baby, the baby didn’t make it either, you know. So like, it's been kinda rough, you know, with the whole family and no visiting. They’ve been doing these video visits, but it’s like hell trying to get approved on those, you know.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: I’ve had a couple friends that’ve applied for it, it’s just, there’s been no response, you know, no emails back. It’s kinda hectic, you know, but I mean, I don’t have anything to compare it to, you know. This is like, this is all new, you know. It’s this whole pandemic shit. Pardon my French.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, I’m sorry you had to go through that.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, I guess it’s part of life, you know, and it's my own actions put me here. I still have a chance, though you know. I should be out in about a year or so, on a eight-year sentence.</br></br>

So I have a chance to, you know, at least, well, as long as God willing, of course, you know, to make things right, you know, but yeah. You got any other questions?</br></br>

UCI: Yes, of course.</br></br>

Caller: There’s this little paper that was printed out that’s like, how’s the vaccinations been going on at your facility? Okay, so they come once a week, and they do COVID tests once a week.</br></br>

UCI: Hello? Hello? Hello?</br></br>

Caller: Can you hear me?</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, yeah, I lost you.</br></br>

Caller: Where did we stop? Where did you stop hearing me?</br></br>

UCI: Just recently, like 10 seconds ago, I lost you.</br></br>

Caller: Oh, okay. So they were administering these tests right. They were every Thursday but I think now that this whole building that I’m in has been vaccinated, I believe they’re just random now, you know.</br></br>

I haven’t been tested in a few weeks, but I don’t have any symptoms or anything, you know, so it’s not like I, no complaints you know. In my opinion, this prison’s done pretty well actually with COVID, you know, to the best of their ability, if you ask me.</br></br>

I mean, but not everybody feels the same, you know. But I’m not one to look at all the negative. I try to look at everything, you know, glass half-full. I don’t know. You know some people complain over little shit, you know.</br></br>

Yeah, but as far as cases, I’ll say for the first, back in October I was pretty worried. I was pretty worried. Especially after my sister passed away and all that, yeah I was really worried. I got really worried.</br></br>

And then I finally - I barely got vaccinated in March, so the stress from October, November, December, January, those four months, that four-month period, that was like a nail-biter, you know. That was pretty, it kinda wears on you, you know.</br></br>

But after I got the vaccination, you know, I don’t really, you know, worrying won’t help me at this point, you know. So I kinda just take it as is, you know.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah. So how have you been coping with all this crisis, this situation?</br></br>

Caller: Well, I run a mile a day. I run a mile a day, I work out, I try to stay healthy, healthy as possible, you know. That’s my stress reliever.</br></br>

That’s how I keep, you know, myself from going crazy, I guess, you know. Exercise definitely. Yeah, that’s about it really.</br></br>

UCI: And so, in your point of view, what would you have done in this situation to make the facility better? What would you recommend?</br></br>

Caller: Well, okay, I would say, okay, let's see, a lot of people lost their jobs, okay, so financially, for a lot of my fellow inmates here, you know, we don’t really have anything, you know.</br></br>

So, if there were some kind of funds that could be allocated, you know, to the prison or to the prisons in general, some kind of relief packages for low-income individuals or people that don’t get store or people that don’t have anybody that has money to take care of them, you know.</br></br>

That would help out a lot, you know, in the financial aspect, you know, 'cause people are struggling out there, they can’t afford to be taking care of someone that's in prison if they can barely make ends meet themselves with the pandemic, you know. So that’s the financial struggle.</br></br>

And then, let me think, the visitation, I mean, that’s really, the video visits, I mean it sounds good but, I don't hardly hear anybody call for visiting. I’m pretty sure that it's more that just - I’m pretty sure that I’m not the only one that’s waiting for my friends or family members to get approved for visiting.</br></br>

I don’t know what the delay is on that, but it would be nice to see somebody’s face, you know. I mean, I’ve been incarcerated now for almost three and a half years, you know.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, I understand. And in this aspect is there anything in particular you would want people on the outside to know about your situation in regards to COVID?</br></br>

Caller: In regards to COVID? I would say, in regards to COVID, in my situation. You know, okay, I heard President Trump say this right, and really, I have to agree, it was one of the few things that I do agree with, with what he said is the mental aspect.</br></br>

You know like, if you hear the virus, you know, if you let the mental aspect, or the negativity that surrounds, well I might get the virus possibly, you know, if you let that scare you, it’s gonna - it's gonna, you know, the mental aspect is more excruciating than possibly even getting it.</br></br>

So you know, you just gotta keep yourself mentally, you know, keep your mind in shape, you know, keep yourself up. It’s hard to say. You know, don’t let it defeat you before you get it, you know.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, of course, of course. And is there anything else that you believe that other people should know?</br></br>

Caller: In regards to COVID? Well, shit, some prisons are really going through it, you know, with this whole COVID situation. You know, they don’t tell us the numbers.</br></br>

We don’t know, we don’t get the information, we can’t tell, they’re not gonna tell us, you know, how many people have the virus right here, you know. I just know that they'll have entire buildings that have COVID, people that have it, you know, COVID.</br></br>

And then they’ll wipe out an entire building and put them all in one spot, you know. At a certain point in time, if you caught COVID-19, you were moved to this spot whether you wanted to get moved or not, you had to go you know. But, like, what was the question?</br></br>

UCI: Oh no, it was just regarding anything else that, you know, you would like people to know.</br></br>

Caller: I mean, it would be nice if we had some kind of newspaper in here, to know what was going on, on the outside, you know, or what’s going on at this facility. It would be really, you know, it would definitely help out a lot. It would put a lot of people at ease if we knew what was going on you know, and a lot of us don’t have access to.</br></br>

UCI: Hello?</br></br>

Caller: Nice to be informed here.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, yeah, cut off again.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah. It would be nice to be informed, like to not be stuck in limbo you know, to know what’s going on. In here, even out there, not everyone has a TV and everything, you have to buy that kind of stuff, you know.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, and is there anything you would like to know more of or, in regard to this project?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, whatever information you have, send it to the people you sent the letters to. That would be nice with what’s going on. That would be cool.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, yeah, of course.</br></br>

Caller: All right.</br></br>

UCI: All right. If you have any people that you know that would want to participate in the project as well.
