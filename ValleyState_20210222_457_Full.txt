This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Valley State.</br></br>

Hello Mr.,</br></br>And thank you for writing me. I’ve been trying to share my experience with multiple attorneys who might be willing to help me, but as yet to receive a response?</br></br>
Back in March of 2020 I became ill with flu like symptoms and was put in quarantine with another inmate also with symptoms of his own. We received daily vitals checks and medication twice a day for seven days then returned to normal housing. After about a month I continued to have pressure on my chest, was seen by medical staff on three different occasions with no results found. I had asked if I should be tested for COVID-19 but was told it was a flu.</br></br>
I have never had a flu that stayed in my chest for so long duration before in my life, was told back in the August medical visit I would have follow up that has not happened to this day. The whole basis for me writing attorneys is this. The quarantines in earnest started in September for me as well as the whole prison.</br></br>

In my dorm low at that time had three inmates working in optical where they were in contact with free-staff all day and were told they had been closed down for a week because a free staff tested positive. This became the norm. Every time someone tested positive we went on quarantine. And it may seem like an accident that CDCR started moving inmates in and out of dorms, buildings, and yard right after the government passed the expedited early release program related to COVID-19 after myself and I am sure many others who had real concerns as I do.</br></br>

But as always CDCR always finds a way to make a law not apply, how! Give everyone COVID by moving inmates returning from testing positive into dorms where everyone has been testing negative, working to perfection. Here we are doing everything in our control to be safe only to have CDCR bring it into your housing.</br></br>
Example, I had over a dozen negative tests since they started testing for COVID only to have them move two inmates into our dorm while we're on quarantine. Both arrived complaining of still not having taste or sense of smell, and within a few days of arriving one began to have symptoms, fever, and chills but would avoid the daily temperature checks. Within a week two more had fevers, by that time it was too late.</br></br> 

We were tested on December with four positives and moved to the COVID-19 yard until coming back to C yard on January 2021. We were put on quarantine on November and didn’t come off until aforementioned date. 51 straight days on quarantine, with two phone calls and two days of yard in that span of 51 days.</br></br>

With a mother coming up on 101 years old in March, God willing it was very stressful not knowing if I would ever get to talk to her again. Not knowing how your family is doing out there in this pandemic, not knowing if I got sick really bad, how would I reach my family.</br></br>
This place of having to deal with COs and their mood swings, inmates who harbor so much hate towards everyone, the thought of getting sick and possibly dying is a real concern at my age.</br></br>
I was given the highest assessment score for the expedited early release program, of six points because of my age 67, high risk medical, and pre-existing medical conditions. But what good does that do me now that I’ve tested positive? While I was on quarantine in my paperwork clearly stated to be isolated for 14 days but had sick inmates move in and out until they move me to a dorm full of sick inmates until I was returned to C yard.</br></br>

Mr. I hope this is not too long and you can read my writing and I thank you for reaching out to me and will forward this info for others. God bless you and loved ones.</br></br>
 PS, I have dates and can get names if needed? Please let me know if I can be of more help. I will keep you and your loved ones in my prayers and remain safe, COVID free.</br></br>
Thank you for your time.
