This story was told by a person incarcerated at Fresno County Jail.</br></br>

Caller: So we're dealing with different behaviors, you know? The guys that talk to themselves walk around in a circle, you know, that kind of rubs off. But, you know, it's healthy.</br></br> 

I don't know if you noticed - have you ever watched a movie called Legend? You know, Will Smith was alone in the world, and he set up mannequins to talk to because, you know, he wanted to keep his mind healthy.</br></br>

So, it's actually a good thing. It's not a bad thing to talk to yourself. You know? Contrary to common belief, it's actually a good thing to talk to yourself. You know? It keeps you sane, especially in a place like this.</br></br>

Everybody has a wife that they have in their head that, you know, they might not be married, but we have like this imaginary woman that keeps us sane that we love, that we attend to. I mean, that's mostly incarceration. That's what the mind does, you know, especially in isolation. You know, we come up with things to love.</br></br>

You know, it's not necessarily we want to be loved. It's that, as men and before we die, we want to love somebody. We want to love something. We want to give back. You know? And that's the main goal that we all have. You know?</br></br>

Because we're concerned that it, you  know, we did the swabs, so but we're concerned that it is going to come back positive. Somebody is. And if that does happen, then it's going to be an outbreak, you know?</br></br> 

So, we're just waiting, you know, for the results. And then after the results, should be in a couple more days, then we'll see what happens from there.</br></br>

So, yeah, so that's what's going on. I mean, a lot of policies don't exist, a lot of procedures don't exist, and the institution, that we hear, is working on those policies and setting things in place to, you know, protect us, you know, from having our rights violated. I'm sure they are. I hope they are. But, you know, more than likely, they are.</br></br>

So, with the guards and stuff like that, they're very brave because they know they can be exposed, but they still come in here and do the security checks and security sweeps and expose themselves. So, you know, we call them the Purple Hearts, you know, because they're very beautiful people.</br></br>

And we notice this. You know? We're noticing how, you know, at least, on some level, you know, we are, you know, thought of, you know? Because they don't have to come in here, you know, they could just stay at the door and treat us like we're diseased, you know? But they don't. So, shout out to them, you know? I mean, it's a good thing.
