This story was told by a person incarcerated at Mule Creek.</br></br>

Caller: Well, on the 14th of December, I was called out of my regular housing unit, and I was told to, that I have, was tested positive for COVID-19 and to go pack my stuff. So, I was moved to another building, and I had questions, you know. And I asked to speak with a doctor, and I asked to be retested for COVID-19 because I haven't had any symptoms and I feel fine and I think it's a mistake.</br></br>

And they said, "Oh, too bad. We don't retest, and one test is enough." So, they locked me in another building with a bunch of COVID-positive people, and five days later I started feeling symptoms of COVID. And being HIV-positive, I found myself needing answers: "What do I do to protect myself? Do I need, you know, medication?"</br></br>

And so I put out a request for medical, and the medical was all denied, stating that it was not medically necessary that I'd be seen. So, they gave me some cough drops. I didn't have a cough. But it kind of upset me to get cough drops because when I was a small child, my grandmother would take me to church.</br></br>

And halfway through the sermon, as a little boy I would get restless, and my grandmother would give me bubblegum or a cough drop or something to keep me busy. And that's what the state went and did. And it's like, "Really?"</br></br>

And so after 14 days of being confined with no medical access, I seen a doctor that was going to clear me of COVID-19 no matter what I said. And sure enough, I was cleared of COVID-19 and sent back to a building with COVID-negative people.</br></br>

And I still have not seen a doctor. So, yeah, it has not been good. I didn't get a printout or a pamphlet or anything of what to expect, what was gonna happen, what would happen if I got really bad sick, nothing. You know, It was nothing. So, that's pretty much my experience with COVID in prison.</br></br>

UCI: Wow, I'm sorry to hear that. And what is troubling you or concerning you at this moment?</br></br>

Caller: Well, if - with my medical condition, is there - can I get it again?</br></br>

The HIV, are my numbers – do I need to see my specialist for that? I have questions. I don't have the symptoms. I still have body aches, but I don't have – I'm not sneezing or coughing.</br></br>

Nobody had a temperature. I never had a temperature. So, those are my concerns are, do I need medical attention?</br></br>

UCI: And what is the current COVID-19 situation at your facility? How has it been handled since the beginning of the outbreak?</br></br>

Caller: Well, today was the first day that I had been outside. And in our gymnasium, there is a bunch of inmates, and they're on cots. They don't have bathroom access. They have some portable bathrooms out there that don't look like they've been well maintained all that much.</br></br>

They have to bring in a generator to run the power for the bathrooms, and it just doesn't seem – this is a newer facility, and the state was not supposed to be putting people in gymnasiums anymore. But yet the state feels, I believe, that they can get away with doing that, stating that it's an emergency.</br></br>

And any time that there is an emergency, any prior rules just don't really count because now we're under an emergency. So, it's just not right to be putting people – I wouldn't treat my dog if he killed all my chickens as bad as they treat us sometimes.</br></br>

UCI: And is it being handled differently now, the COVID-19 situation at your facility?</br></br>

Caller: COVID-19 is not being handled any differently. It seems like there's a lot of mistakes that are being made. Inmates are being transferred from one building to another instead of keeping everybody where they're at.</br></br>

And to mitigate the spread they had closed the chow hall, and now we all are closer together when we eat than what we would have been if we went to the chow hall. The chow hall is large and has a lot of tables, and we could spread out to eat. And now we eat very close to everybody because we don't have tables to sit on. I sit on an apple box to eat my meals, and there's no table.</br></br>

It doesn't make sense to do a lot of things that they did, but if you don't do anything and something happens, then the state can be liable. So, what they have done is not any better, but at least they've done something. That way when somebody looks at the situation, they can at least say they've done something instead of done nothing at all. But unfortunately what they have done is not better than what it would have been if they'd done nothing at all.</br></br>

UCI: And if possible, could you please tell us month by month how the situation has changed at your facility?</br></br>

Caller: The first two months, we didn't have any PPE and masks or soap or anything like that.</br></br>

Then a memo came out that they were going to start issuing extra soap. So, for two weeks in a row we got extra soap, an extra bar of soap. And then the PPE, the mask, the prison had to make the mask. They didn't allow the store-bought mask, the N95, or the surgical masks that they have in their stockpile. That was not brought out for use.</br></br>

They felt that it would be best to make the mask at the sewing department inside the prison and then distribute it to the 50-something prisons that are in the system. And so that took time. Instead of just using the surgical mask or the N95 mask, they made masks. So, that delayed getting us PPE.</br></br>

And we all know that washing our hands and wearing a mask was one of the most important things to mitigate the spread. So, that was a delay. So, once they started doing – getting us masks, they realized after five months that those masks are not as good as the masks – the surgical mask and the N95 mask. So, now every day at lunch, I mean, at breakfast. I'm sorry. Every day at breakfast we get a new mask to wear.</br></br>

And it's a clean one and it's a disposable one instead of wearing the same mask month after month that we were, the manufactured PIA masks, Prison Industry Authority, in the sewing department that we didn't have access to wash or clean, no chemicals to clean the mask with. So, it's just been one disaster after another.</br></br>

UCI: And what would make the situation at your facility better?</br></br>

Caller: I believe that the situation could be made better by having the ability to social distance and some education on how to clean the surfaces and how long the chemicals have to be on the surface before they do work, because the chemicals that we do have are very weak chemicals.</br></br>

They are not strong chemicals because they're afraid that some inmate might improperly use them and maybe drink them or try to splash them on an officer or something like that. So, the chemicals that we do have are not –</br></br>

They're not the strongest, and we need more cleaning supplies and education on how to properly clean surfaces and stuff, I believe, and that would be a big help on how to social distance and keep things clean.</br></br>

UCI: And how has the COVID-19 situation at your facility affected your loved ones?</br></br>

Caller: It has caused a lot of anxiety with my daughter. This is not a life sentence for me. I have an out date, and with my prior health they have tried to –</br></br>

They have tried to make accommodations for me to come home, and it's just been really difficult and upsetting to a lot of them.</br></br>

UCI: Oh, wow. I'm so sorry to hear that. I know our time is almost up. So, is there anything else that you want the people to know about your experience?</br></br>

Caller: That it's obviously not what the prison says. I believe that it's much more difficult and worse than what the prison portrays it to be.</br></br>

It's just that it's a bad situation. We are human. Well, I appreciate your time.</br></br>

UCI: Well, I want to thank you very much for participating in PrisonPandemic. Please consider telling your friends about us and seeing if they would like to call in sometime.
