This story was told by a person incarcerated at Elmwood Correctional Facility.</br></br>

UCI: How has been it been for you to have reduced visitation and programming?</br></br>

Caller: How has it been what?</br></br>

UCI: Do you feel like there has been reduced visitation and programming at your facility?</br></br>

Caller: The visitation with loved ones from the outside visiting?</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, yeah. Has there been less of that? And how has that affected you?</br></br>

Caller: They put a table, like two tables between me and my sister when she came. It was like - almost like saying “Hi” from far enough away where we almost had to raise our voices. It was pretty safe of them. Yeah. Pretty safe of them. They were being very cautious.</br></br>

UCI: Oh okay. That’s good. At any point did they stop visitations for you guys at all?</br></br>

Caller: No, my mom’s too old to come down much. So, I really - don't have enough - like if I had anybody in this town,  myself, close enough – my sister and mother have to drive down together in order to come down and visit me and my sister’s homeschools her grandkids at this point. </br></br>

Yeah, pretty interesting life she has. She’s already done a generation of homeschooling, and another now because her youngest are in high school believe it or not. Yeah.</br></br>

UCI: That’s awesome.
