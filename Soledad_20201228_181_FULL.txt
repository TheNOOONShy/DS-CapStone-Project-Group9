Dear UCI student,</br></br>

Greetings! As you can see, I am currently incarcerated at Correctional Training Facility (CTF-North), in Soledad, California.</br></br>

I am writing to respond to your letter, which I received on the 23rd of December.</br></br>

Enclosed you will find my story regarding the pandemic status where I am at.</br></br>

Let me begin by saying, thank you for reaching out and for caring. Thank you and the people involved in with this project. Thank you for being human in remembering that the incarcerated community are humans as well. Most of society does not.</br></br>

I hope and God (or your higher power) willing when you receive this letter it finds you doing good in everything, are well in health, and are staying safe from this pandemic. I hope the same for your family, friends, and community.</br></br>

I think our society has routinely given the least attention to the group who need it most. Recently, the people in power have begun to reconsider some of the harsh, excessive laws that plague our justice system. Leaders are coming together with lawmakers and beginning to understand that the overcrowded state of prisons has been an ongoing issue for decades. It shouldn’t have to come down to a global pandemic to realize that the system is flawed and in need of change.</br></br>

It’s people like you and this project that give us hope in letting us know that we are not forgotten. Thank you for not seeing us apart from society, hidden out of sight, and having no community.</br></br>

Thank you for reaching out dear UCI student. I say this with respect and love that my higher power - God - has given me and to share with others. Thank you for your time, attention, participation in this project, and service.</br></br>

Take care and be careful with this pandemic out there. Stay strong, positive, and motivated. Keep up the good work, with the goal of always helping others and being of service.</br></br>

Thank you. Blessings and may you have a nice day.</br></br>
 
Sincerely and in gratitude.</br></br>

My story regarding my experience with the coronavirus pandemic in prison.</br></br> 

These are definitely difficult and challenging times.</br></br> 

From the middle of the month of November, the facility in which I am in (North, A-yard), we started getting inmates infected in numbers with COVID-19. Central Facility was infected first, then South, and lastly North.</br></br> 

It’s been hard because our normal program has been taken away as far as no school, no work, no self-help programs. Very limited, almost to none, canteen/commissary availability. Very limited, almost to none, yard recreational activity (maybe for one to two hours every fourth day, and this includes phone use as the phones are out on the yard).</br></br> 

Very limited, almost to none, vendor packages given and definitely no visits at all. No contact visits, no family visits, no behind the glass visits, zero, nothing. There are no dayroom (inside the building activities). And showers are very limited to the number that can be used and now they’ve only been open (given access to them) every third or fourth day approximately.</br></br> 

The building I live in has an A-side and B-side. It is three tiers (floors/levels) and it is cell living. The way they have it set up is, A-side is quarantine for the infected and B-side is for the one’s that are negative and show no detection of symptoms of COVID. There’s movement though both sides by correctional officers, free staff (as nurses), and inmates (as porters and kitchen workers), and it’s still spreading this way. It’s cycling around.</br></br> 

This is a health hazard, limiting health safety of self and others. There is very limited to no movement on a daily basis. This adds a potential life sentence to my already life sentence that I’m serving.</br></br>

In the free world, people can adjust to social distancing from others, but for myself and other inmates, we are not afforded that liberty. We are forced to be close to one another in cells, dorms, restrooms, eating facilities, gyms, and outdoor areas. Due to the dense population and close proximity, the coronavirus can spread rapidly throughout the prison.</br></br> 

As of 12/15/2020, in this institution of CTF, Correctional Training Facility, combining the three facilities of North, South, and Central there has been 912 inmates with COVID-19 and counting, and five deaths so far. Once again, correctional officers, mental health providers, and medical staff consistently come in and out of prison, presenting a higher risk of infection for us inmates.</br></br>  

The prison’s health care is the worst, and is not reliable. They do not respond quickly and we do not receive the medical treatment needed to fight, recover, or stop the spread of this deadly virus within the prison.</br></br> 

I have personally been tested for COVID-19 seven times (last one on the 23rd of December 2020), have resulted negative - no detection or symptoms from mid November and I am still on lockdown/quarantine for no reason. What’s the point?</br></br> 

I hope my story helps you out towards your goal and research. I really do appreciate you extending a hand out to get a glimpse of what I’m going through with so many others.</br></br> 

Thank you for your time, attention, dedication, reaching out, caring, and service.</br></br> 

Sincerely.
