This story was told by a family member of someone incarcerated at Tulare Bob Wiley Detention Center.</br></br>UCI: How has their situation affected you and your family?</br></br>
Caller: Well, they stopped doing visits pretty close to the beginning of the virus, you know, like, when they started doing shut downs. Like, from then on, we weren't having visits even when places started to open. And I feel like it's ridiculous because the stools are six feet apart anyway.</br></br> 

And you know, they're behind the screen. So, you know, if we wore masks and everything, I don't see why we wouldn't be able to have in person visits. I think they're just really taking advantage of the situation.</br></br>And so now, if we want to have visits we have to use IC solutions. And before it was GTL. So, the visits were 15 dollars for 30 minutes. Now they're much less.</br></br>UCI: And these are in person visits that you're talking about?</br></br>Caller: Yeah, I mean, yeah. So, we haven't had in person visits for years. Since the virus started. We've had to pay for them, for video visits.
