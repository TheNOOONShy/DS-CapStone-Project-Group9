Dear PrisonPandemic project,</br></br>

I came down with a positive test for COVID-19. I was rehoused inside the gym, a makeshift COVID-19 quarantine dorm, for two weeks. Medical staff took my vitals twice per day (blood pressure, oxygen level, temperature). I wasn’t exhibiting any symptoms for COVID-19. Thus, it was concluded by a PCP that I either had a mild case of COVID-19 or a false positive.</br></br>

After two weeks of quarantine, I was released and returned to my regular housing. Needless to say, being in quarantine with 28 other inmates, all in the same fate as I was, jeopardize my health and safety. Today, I turned 67 years old. I’m classified as a “high-risk medical,” due to age and pre-existing medical issues.</br></br> 

Such as high blood pressure, Parkinson’s disease, just to name two.</br></br>

Yesterday, the prison medical staff passed out the enclosed notice about inmates receiving the vaccine for COVID-19. I thought you might like to see it for your UCI team collecting of stories about what is all happening on the front line of the prison COVID-19 pandemic.</br></br>

Feel free to contact my attorney for additional information about my status.
