This letter was written by a person incarcerated at High Desert.</br></br>


Hi again. Forwarding you a personal letter your way, because I'm lonely and haven’t had any woman conversation in years. But now I’m here to have a conversation with any open ears.</br></br>


I’ve studied a whole lot since I’ve been incarcerated. I’ve learned so much and me myself can tell things that’s so cold, on a nice summer day. Even though I'm black and incarcerated don’t mean nothing, it’s not about race or if you're somebody different.</br></br>


I love everybody equal and that’s the truth. Hopefully, we can be good friends, I’m loyal and my friendship carries forever. I’m from California by the way, you already know my name cause you wrote to me.</br></br>


So let me say, hi there. I’m 56 years young and I’m 5’11” and 191lbs. Strong and ready to be set free from Hell itself. I stay to myself and this is a big reason I’m coming home. Most don’t make it out of here alive cause dealing with drugs and politics will get you hurt, so I decided to come home. Thank God cause I don’t belong here in a cage like a dog.</br></br>


I came in here cause I let somebody use my car and they robbed a back in my car and didn’t tell me and I got the time for it cause I wouldn’t tell them who had my car. I couldn’t do that, but do trust me and get to know me, I’m a picture, perfect person and a wonderful man.</br></br>


I’m not in need of any thing I have my own money, I just need some women to make conversation. So please stay forward and blessed.
