This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Donovan.</br></br>The next question “How have you felt about your safety inside?” Despite, the above ending paragraph about CDCR mischief conduct, I have seriously followed the health care service provider’s advice and instructions by continuing to wear my mask at all times, staying at least six feet from others, and washing my hands often to stop the continuing spread of the virus in my area or around the facility. Also, I constantly take advantage of the COVID-19 test every chance I am allowed to do so, I have taken (6) COVID-19 tests with negative results every time. Yet, I am skeptical about the vaccine, due to pass history stories and conflicting negative news information.</br></br>However, as to your fifth question “How have the vaccinations been going at your facility?” The provided vaccines have been going rather smoothly for the once infected inmates, though for some, there have been side effects that have been discomfort experiences. But most inmates are happy, while the others are unfazed about reality.</br></br>Moving on to the next question “What has it been like to have reduced visitations from family and love ones?” It’s been difficult, because I look forward to the weekends when I visit with family. However, I understand and realize the health and safety seriousness of family separation because of this pandemic situation.</br></br>Yet I am grateful for the created video visiting system that CDCR has introduced to the CDC incarceration population. It’s my opinion, that the video visiting experience was a enjoyable opportunity to me, and everyone else with no complaints to mention at this time.</br></br>
