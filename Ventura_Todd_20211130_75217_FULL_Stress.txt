UCI: And how has the COVID situation been like there?</br></br> 

Caller: Well, kind of - I guess, kind of crappy, I guess –pretty much. In my section, we’re only allowed one or two hours out a day.</br></br> 

UCI: Have they been vaccinating everyone?</br></br> 

Caller: Yeah. As far as I know, no. They haven't mentioned anything like that and I’ve been here about just over [redacted] actually, I've been here.</br></br> 

UCI: So how have you been co–</br></br> 

Caller:[Unintelligible] anybody or asked anybody. Oh, go ahead. I’m sorry.</br></br> 

UCI: Oh, I was going to ask you how have you been coping?</br></br> 

Caller: Well, just like – the good thing is I guess, you know, you can’t complain much. I've been grateful for things we do have. So, I have a tablet. So I read positive or I – I go to podcasts that are like - like you know, the Christian type things or spiritual enlightenment type things.</br></br>

It’s called “hard timing” when you don’t have visits that are limited and communication is limited. But like I said, we have a iPad, so that helps a lot. So I guess, out of 10, it would be about a six.</br></br> 

UCI: What would make the situation better do you think?</br></br> 

Caller: Probably more dayroom hours. More than likely, because I don't – we only get one or two hours. So, I would say a minimum of at least three — another hour. That would make it a lot better.</br></br> 

Increased visits, free phone time, that would be – because there’s a lot of people who don’t have you know, the financial wear-with-all to buy phone time. So, I’d think that would be a great —</br></br> 

UCI: Hello? Can you hear me?
