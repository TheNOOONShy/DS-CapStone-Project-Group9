This letter was written by a person incarcerated at OC Central. </br></br>Hello PrisonPandemic, </br></br>I pray this reaches you in all love and blessings from our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Thank you for your consideration and for all your doing to help those incarcerated. In December I tested positive for Covid-19. After I was moved with many others to another dorm. I was living with 68 men before testing positive and then moved with 68 other men who were Covid-19 positive and was housed with them. </br></br>In that I witnessed a man stop breathing and have a seizure. It was definitely a scary time. Definitely wasn’t ideal. But I don’t blame the OCSD as I cant imagine anyone was prepared for this outbreak. I came here in March, 2019, before the pandemic. The incident I wrote about was from this year. I was moved February 7th of this year, to now be housed in a 40 man dorm, but we are only at 26 currently. </br></br>When visits were shut down in March of 2020 it was very difficult. During that time my grandmother died of Covid-19. And recently my dad got Covid-19 in December 2020 and is still in the hospital. He also had a stroke and two blood clots. Because of not having visits for a year I may never see my dad again on Earth. But thank God for the hope of heaven. </br></br>As far as my safety inside I feel we are ok but in the beginning it sucked that not all the deputies would wear masks. The worst part though is we do not receive hot meals. We used to get hot breakfast and dinner. But for more than a year they’ve stopped hot breakfast. They brought back hot dinners only Monday thru Friday in around July or August but took them away in November. This is the part I don’t understand, how we cant get hot meals? </br></br>They bring on workers, even those who haven’t even been vaccinated but we cant get hot meals? Im happy theres visits but to me it seems hot meals should come first. I have been vaccinated and that process seems to run smoothly. I by no means want to put down OCSD. Just stating truths. Well hope to hear from you soon.
