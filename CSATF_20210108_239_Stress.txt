This letter was written by a person incarcerated at SATF (California Substance Abuse Treatment and State Prison).</br></br>

My life is in “imminent danger“ due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This formal letter and complaint is to place on direct notice the committee of, the PrisonPandemic project of UC Irvine, that the COVID-19 pandemic has greatly jeopardize the health, life and safety of California citizens, and throughout the world, and has directly placed my life in “imminent danger.”</br></br>

I am currently incarcerated/subjugated at CSP-SATF, C.FAC. And I have great fears that the president and his administration is not equipped nor capable, and even less prepared to protect my health and safety and therefore my life from the ravages that the COVID-19 (Coronavirus) can inflict on my personal health and life. There’s a plethora of medical and technical evidence that there are many unknown variables related to COVID-19 and how it affects those who are infected, and that everyone can be affected differently.</br></br>

There is also substantial evidence of the unique and specific effects of COVID-19 upon people of African-American descent, therefore I have a higher rate of exposure and life-threatening consequences if and/or I’m exposed to the corona virus. There are no guarantees that I won’t contract the corona virus, especially under the dire conditions that prison presents to its population.</br></br>
