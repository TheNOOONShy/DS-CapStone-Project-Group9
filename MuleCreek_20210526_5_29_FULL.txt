This phone call was made by an inmate in Mule Creek State Prison.</br></br>
UCI: How has the COVID situation been like at your facility?</br></br>
 Caller: Well, like it’s been crazy, cause you know, when it first started not that many people had it and I was going to college and I was doing my job and then I was going to help groups and stuff like that and then once the COVID hit, it started getting everything down and had us you know like there was like 100 people in the jail all crammed in a we couldn’t use the bathroom, because the bathrooms they had porter potties, right and they only had like one bathroom throughout the whole day so it was kind of hard to go. Just imagine like 100 people trying to use the bathroom. So it was hectic. And then I couldn’t get my school work, at college I was taking statistics at the time and so I couldn’t you know get the work that I had coming to me and I was in groups and I wasn’t able to get the time to work in and it was crazy because we had to quarantine. I think that some of the stuff was false positive because I wasn’t really even sick. You know I didn’t have any symptoms or anything and they just took us. It was crazy and they just took us to the gym. They started taking everyone. It was like a money scheme or something. The more people they had sick, the more resources they needed. I don’t know how to explain it, but it was hectic. And it’s still hectic because now they are saying that they have more people starting to catch it. Only one or two people I know are quarantined and not all of our staff is vaccinated, so if they are not vaccinated we are still subject to getting contaminated with it you know. I have been vaccinated and you know hopefully that will protect me.  So that is the majority of what had been going on.</br></br>
 UCI: So the vaccination situation at your facility has been good recently?</br></br>
 Caller: Well I’ve been vaccinated. I got vaccinated like back in March so everybody has been getting vaccinated. So yes it has been going well with the vaccinations and they are still testing us every week. All the people that had jobs it was like random testing I guess, but we were like why are we getting tested if we already got vaccinated? You know, with both shots. So, I don’t know, I can't explain it.</br></br>
 UCI: How has The COVID situation affected your loved ones such as with reduced visitation and everything?</br></br>
 Caller: Well the visits, we haven’t had visits, they just started slowly having some, but they make you get tested and then when you get a visitor, there is like a long table that you have to sit across. I mean I would not even have my people drive this far, cause I’m in Mule Creek and I’m from San Francisco, so they’ve got like a three hour drive or something like that.</br></br>
 UCI: How have you been coping with everything?</br></br>
 Caller: I mean it is a mental battle. I have just been trying to stay busy like doing self help work and you know I have my case in the federal court so I have been down for a minute. It is been like 20 years now and I’m closer to my own, so I’m just trying to make sure I’m not dying because we are trying to stay protected. As far as the staff because now all of them aren’t vaccinated and they are still coming to work and putting us in danger. And I do not  think they know how to handle the situation anyway as far as what to do, I guess in the whole world nobody knows what to do. I do not know. They don’t have a plan I think, they just are going off whatever they think. Where is this place again?</br></br>
 UCI:  Where is it or what is it?</br></br>
 Caller: Where is it?</br></br>
 UCI: I believe the mailing address is Sunland, but the University is actually located in Irvine.</br></br>
 Caller: Ohh Irvine, Texas?</br></br>
 UCI: No, Irvine Southern California.</br></br>
 Caller: You said you are recording this call?</br></br>
 UCI: Yes. So the phone conversation gets recorded and then if there is any identifying information, that will be edited out of the conversation and you know, part of your story will be posted online you know so that others can hear what’s going on from different facilities and everything throughout California. </br></br>
 Caller: Okay. Can you stop recording? Because I don’t want to, I do not know.</br></br>
