I was one of the guys who caught the virus, and I was really worried because we were hearing names almost every week of someone who passed away. Being that I was already trying to deal with a compromised immune system, got even more scarier because we found out that the virus attacks your lungs and immune system, two of the medical conditions I am already having problems with. When you catch or test positive for COVID-19, the only thing they do, is move you to another part of the prison for isolation and come check your temperature and oxygen level twice a day but never gave us anything to help with the symptoms we had.
