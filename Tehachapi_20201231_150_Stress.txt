OK, so being in prison while all this pandemic stuff is going on and the Black Lives Matter movement and protests are going on and not being out there, I feel left out and feel like no one cares about us prisoners. This whole time probably maybe only once or three times have I heard the news talk about the pandemic, pandemic prisons, or California prisons. How and what are they doing to keep us from catching this disease?</br></br> 

But watching all these people dying in the free world and seeing the nurses and doctors doing their jobs to the extreme. I feel sad and hopeless. And I feel like I am being held back from helping all these people who are affected. I feel traumatized, too, because I see people on the news losing their loved ones and I've developed empathy and sympathy. And feeling the feelings for others. It gets me sad. And I pray a lot to Yahweh God and the Lord Jesus Christ to help us.</br></br> 

And so it feels like God is sparing me from having to deal with this pandemic. But I'm dealing with it a lesser form of it here in prison. And I have a family that are essential workers and are working now and I hope and pray that they don’t catch COVID-19.</br></br> 

This situation feels so surreal and I still cannot believe that this is going on. I protect myself here but I don’t know. Sometimes I think I am doing too much or not enough. But watching all these things on TV or on the news, I wish I could be out there, helping in some type of way. So when these things happen, I ask who is accountable for all these things?</br></br> 

Who’s right, who’s wrong? Why is this happening? Why are there people dying? Who is concerned about me and my life? I only have family: my mom, two brothers, and a stepdad. I wish I could have a female pen-pal to write to and get me through these times. I am open-minded to a lot of things. If you need help and I am able, I am willing.</br></br> 

But please write back to me so I can know you received this piece of mail and not that a correction officer threw it away. Because someone has stolen my mail before a drawing that I have sent to my family. It was gone. I am an artist, I draw, play guitar, sing, write lyrics!</br></br> 

OK, well, hopefully all is well with you guys and safe. Hope I didn’t overdo it. Feels like I could’ve wrote a book or movie. God bless you all and take care. All that I wrote is true.
