Dear PrisonPandemic,</br></br>

I hope this message finds you in good health and spirits. Well my friend ask me to write you to inform you about our situation. This letter is written for the purpose of pursuing the interest of justice, to blow the whistle on the “Systemic Racism” that these peace officer’s personnel, committing “Hate Crimes” and other crimes against inmates.</br></br>

Administration is allowing officers to filed false reports at North Kern State Prison to cover-up these “dirty cops” crimes. Could you please help “us” to expose the scheme that N.K.S.P. getting away with. I informed the warden K. Santoro and the office of the inspector general with no help.</br></br>

I ask the warden can I pay for a polygraph examination out of my trust account to expose and reveal the truth about these “dirty cops.” I was denied. I would also like to inform you about the conditions during this pandemic.</br></br>

We are always wearing the same mask. Not allow to exchange our masks. We only get one bar of soap for a whole week. There surface we touch, that does not get cleaned.</br></br>

Disinfectant is only distributed only once a week. All water. I would like to say more, but I can’t say too much more in this letter. The dirty cops will set me up again.</br></br>

Can I call you collect? So we can talk more about regarding this situation? I hope to hear from you soon.</br></br>

Thank you for your time.
