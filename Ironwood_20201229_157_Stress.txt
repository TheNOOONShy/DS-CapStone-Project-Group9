Coping with this crisis has not been all that difficult for me. I face every crisis, challenge, issue, and situation the exact same way. I identify my role in it, I control what I am capable of controlling, I change what I’m able to change, and the rest I surrender to God’s control. I know how to problem solve using logical and critical thinking. I am aware of my emotional state throughout the day. I live a life based on love not fear.</br></br> 

I am able to communicate my needs and desires to my support network. All of these things built upon my foundation of faith in Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior allow me to live my life in victory. I have meaning and purpose which cannot be taken from me. I know that I am worthy of being loved and to love others.
