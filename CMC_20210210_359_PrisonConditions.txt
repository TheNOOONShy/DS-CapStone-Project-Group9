This letter was written by a person incarcerated at CMC (California Men's Colony).</br></br>

Nonetheless, around the summer I began to sleep less and less. Coronavirus cases began to appear and one guy that I actually know died from it.</br></br> 

Soon I stopped going to yard. I began rejecting the food from the kitchen. Because even though it is cooked mainly by inmates I know their supervisors came in and out of the prison five to six days a week.</br></br>

By this time Fauci has reversed his view on wearing masks, so now the prison is under mandate. Particularly the prisoners. The staff wear them when they interact with us on the whole, but never when they're amongst one another. Mix that in with the fact that the closer the inmate and staff work together, the less likely they are to stay masked up around each other.</br></br>

Now, these types of situations are the most likely culprit for mode of transmission. In all reality this is a closed environment. Under such restrictions as zero visiting and no prisoners being able to leave the grounds and then come back, there remains only one solid way to introduce COVID-19 into a petri dish like prison.</br></br> 

It has to be brought in. By staff.</br></br>

Now this makes way too much sense. So the prevailing thought is that we are still the primary source. I have watched medical professionals say, “it's getting into the prison population through the mail and packages.” They even said it with a straight face.</br></br>

A quarterly package takes three days to get here. Then a week perhaps for the prisoner to get it. I've been in prison for 15 years now. And in all of that time I've never received a letter in less than a week from the day it was sent. The very letter that I am responding to is postmarked January 30, 2021.</br></br> 

It's now February 9, 2021. That's 11 days. Coronavirus lasts 72 hours on most surfaces? Hmm.</br></br>

Yet we are to blame. It's our fault. Our families write us and infect us. They send us packages and those companies infect us.</br></br> 

It can't be the non-mask wearing social and un-distanced staff who are the vector. No. Can't be!
