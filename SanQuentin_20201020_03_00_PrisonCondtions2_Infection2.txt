And San Quentin was pretty good. They had a new medical facility and the doctors and the CMO, the Chief Medical Officer and stuff were actually pretty good people. And you could get what you need.</br></br>

But, so 120 guys from Chino, who allegedly had filed some kind of a class action or some kind of a brief to the judge saying “get us out of here,” I think that's what happened. And so they'd all been tested, they were all being held, pending transfer. The judge overrode the CDCR’s mandate to no transfer, freeze-in-place, and brought these guys in.</br></br>

So they brought them in, they quarantined them for two weeks and tested them before releasing them back out. Within a week of them being there, and we were told they were completely clean, the inmate cases started one, five, seven, 12, 18 whatever and it kept going. When I paroled in July of this year, July 13th, was when they actually physically let me go, there were close to somewhere around 1500 cases.</br></br>

And within 10 days, it was almost two and a half thousand, like another 1000 cases. And they were dropping the prison population. And they were sending people like me who had gotten sick, who tested positive, who was still sick out into quarantine, under this Project Hope program that Newsom was doing.</br></br>

So I ended up nine days in quarantine at a Travelodge. And just before that I'd spent 17 days in quarantine at San Quentin with another week before that knowing that I was sick, but them saying “oh you probably don't have it.” They came to my cell with my- with two of us in a cell and they say to my cellie, “you're- you tested positive.”</br></br>

He says, “I’m not sick. I have no symptoms.” I looked at the guard and said “we're locked in because we can't- this modified program.” And I said, “What about me? I'm feeling like hell.”</br></br>

And he said, “Nope. My clipboard- nope, you’re not on here.” But we tested the exact same day. So, and it wasn't till a week later that they admitted to me, “[redacted] man, you got it. Dude, you have it.”</br></br>
