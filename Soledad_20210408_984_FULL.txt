Dear Barrios Unidos Prison Project, </br></br>

I received the letter and everything that accompanies it, on April 6, 2021 and I want to say thank you. </br></br>

I am happy to hear that you will continue to be there to support me with information I shall request. </br></br>

Hearing directly from me for you to share light on the crisis, I answer as follows: </br></br>

1. To be inside during this time, it's been like more has added to my isolation. </br></br>
2. Inside, my safety is only in the hands of the Lord. </br></br>
3. To have reduced visitation from family and loved ones, itâ€™s been like usual to me, because it is just the same as during normal days when nobody ever thought of visiting me. </br></br>
4. I have been coping with this crisis, trusting in the powers of God and his son, Jesus Christ and the Lord did not allow the virus to affect me. </br></br>
To close, I will send my artwork sometime soon and I will be hoping you will like it. </br></br>


Respectfully.
