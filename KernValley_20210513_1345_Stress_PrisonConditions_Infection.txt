This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Kern Valley.</br></br>

The higher that the COVID-19 (death-rate) continued to climb, day by day, I suffered deep pain and agony as a I worried about my family, each and every day, especially my new born son, who is only ten months old.</br></br>

As a direct result of the grossly incompetent operations of KVSP, with respect to the deadliness of the COVID-19 pandemic, I worried about suffering death, each and every day. I am diagnosed with epilepsy (a seizure disorder),” which during a severe stage of COVID-19, I was deprived medication, in order to treat my medical condition.</br></br> 

My worry was compounded and aggravated as a direct result of the KVSP leadership, willfully, unlawfully, and maliciously violating Governor Newsom’s executive orders with respect to mandatory face-covering, physical/social-distancing, adequate sanitation; soap and hand sanitizers act.</br></br>

Shocking to this day the KVSP administration has utterly failed to provide the prisoner population with any adequate or any amount of disinfectants; hand sanitizers and germ killing soaps. And the pattern of racial discriminations, retaliation, intimidation, and abuse openly promoted at KVSP indeed is out-of-control. The classification “c-status program,” is nothing but a state sanction New Jim Crow system, designed to target, terrorize, torture, and abuse the African American prisoner population.</br></br> 

This racist environment, during the COVID-19 pandemic communicated the very “strong and clear message,” that “black lives” does not, will not, and shall not ever matter in the cdcr prison system.</br></br>

The Calif. Fugitive Slave Act of 1852, has fully been incorporated into the “cdcr c-status program.” During the COVID-19 pandemic KVSP did and continue to do all within its “corrupt power” to shut down the education program, law library program, self-help groups, etc.</br></br>

With evil motive and malicious intent, purpose, and objective to deeply plant nothing, but “negative thoughts” of a “slow death” into the minds of the prisoners; and that there is absolutely nothing positive in the world for them to look forward to, but the reality of the COVID-19 pandemic, racism, and a deeply structured system that hate them and forever shall hate them.</br></br>

KVSP continues to obstruct its visiting program (whether physical and/or video), the ability to strengthen family love, relationship, and communication, is under constant attack. Although, “the mind is a terrible thing to waste,” I have suffered “irreparable mental-harm, pain, torture, and injury,” while confined at KVSP during the COVID-19 pandemic. Regretfully I, “walk through the valley of death,” however I shall continue to “fight for my freedom,” and be forever joined to my family again.</br></br> 

I greatly thank UCI-PPP for allowing me the opportunity to share my story, during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.</br></br>

Sincerely.
