This letter was written by a person incarcerated at High Desert.</br></br>March 9, 2021</br></br>This time during the pandemic has been more than hard for me because the visits aren’t running. And I seem to get anxiety bad. This is the first time being in prison and it’s really hard for me because I have nine years left. And I’m just missing out on so much.</br></br> 

My marriage is going in the wrong direction, and I don’t have any control of the situation.</br></br>Being in High Desert prison, the food is terrible, and we get little portions of food. My safety feels okay because we are finally getting the vaccine. And I just hope they bring back regular visits because I need my family. My story isn’t too interesting but that’s my story.
