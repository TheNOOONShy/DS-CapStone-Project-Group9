This story was told by a person incarcerated at OC Lacy.</br></br>Caller: But it’s like normal, I guess. It’s like, nobody here has it.</br></br>UCI: Well, what guidelines do they have in place there? Like just so like I can envision like how it would be.</br></br>Caller: Well alright for example, like let’s say for example somebody gets arrested right. For example, like me. And then, when you’re at the substation, they ask you have you been in contact with anybody that has COVID? Things like that. Do you feel like you have COVID?</br></br>So then they um take your temperature and then you get transferred to the main facility right? Which is in Santa Ana. So then once you’re there, you go through the process of getting booked into the county jail. Whatever.</br></br>Then, they take your street clothes and then you get transferred. And then they put you in their clothes and then the transfer you to whichever facility or cell, dorm that they want to.</br></br>UCI: Hmm.</br></br>Caller: And once you’re there, they put you in quarantine. Which is probably like three weeks, maybe even longer. It depends if you have it or not. And then they’ll come and they’ll test you out. They’ll- they’ll come and they’ll do COVID test, COVID swab, whatever.</br></br>And then, once you’re there, once you’re like been cleared, like for longer than like three weeks, then you’re officially like cleared. Well like obviously, right? Then, you get house, which is called like regular housing, so that means that you can interact with people that don’t have it.</br></br>So we’re like still doing the six feet rule thing. But other than that, it’s- in the beginning, once you come in, yeah, we’re very cautious about that cause nobody’s trying to catch COVID. But after the fact that we’ve been clean and cleared and healthy and things like that, everything is just normal, back to normal basically.</br></br>Well not normal completely, but it's not as bad as how it was in the beginning.
