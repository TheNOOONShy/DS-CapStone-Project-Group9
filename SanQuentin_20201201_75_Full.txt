"Caged During A Pandemic"</br></br>

I, [Redacted], am a 48 year old African American. I have been incarcerated 26 years. I have served time in 14 of California's 37 prisons.</br></br>

Three of which (at the time) were high security, and the most violent in California. Beginning with Pelican Bay State Prison in 1995, at age 22; Salinas Valley State Prison in 1997, at age 24; and Corcoran State Prison in 1998, at age 26.</br></br>

I survived the violence of these prisons more or less intact, but I would not survive the low level less violent prisons unscathed. I have experienced two deadly disease outbreaks while in the custody of the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, and both time I was infected.</br></br>

The first infection was Valley Fever (coccidiomycosis) at Pleasant Valley State Prison in 2011. The second infection, COVID-19 in 2020, at San Quentin State Prison. To have been infected by, and lived through, two of the deadliest disease outbreaks in state prison history is nothing short of a miracle.</br></br>

Twice I was at deaths door, and for some reason fate, God, the universe (whomever or whatever you choose to call him or her) saw fit to pull me through. This will be the first time I share the harrowing details of being infected, while caged in an institution of a society that has been convinced that it's OK to throw away and disregard its undesirables.</br></br>

Before I begin my story, it must be known: Our belief, as a society, that it is acceptable, for those we have entrusted to incarcerate our fellow citizens, to inflict upon them whatever retribution as they may see fit, makes us all complicit in the sickness and death that has occurred within our prisons.</br></br>
	
It's 2011, I'm in Pleasant Valley State Prison. It's about 1:30 or 2:00 in the afternoon. I am in the prison's kitchen.</br></br>

I am the prison cook. I had just placed 50 or so pans of food in the ovens, preparing to feed 980 or so men. I go to the dining hall area to play cards with a friend while I wait for the food to cook. As we are playing the cards disappear.</br></br>

I tell my friend, "Man I can't see the cards!" He laughs and says, "What do you mean you can't see the cards?" I laugh with him while rubbing and blinking my eyes and shaking my head, trying to get my vision to return.</br></br>

I tell him, "Man I can't see." After several minutes panic sets in. I begin to hyperventilate.</br></br>

My chest starts to hurt. My lungs feel as though they are being squeezed. Its hard to get enough air in me. I call for "Man Down" (emergency help).</br></br>

I am taken to the yard nurse. She tells me, "Aww baby you just got gas" and gives me some anti-gas tablets. I am sent back to my cell, where I sit unable to see.</br></br>

The man in the cell with me tells me, "you better get tested for valley fever." I ask, "What is that?" He explains to me it's a disease that has been making people sick and killing them.</br></br>

I had heard of the disease, but never took it seriously. He tells me to go man down and force them to check for valley fever. I take his suggestion.</br></br>

I am taken to CTC (Central Treatment Center). I am tested, given antibiotics and Diflucan (an antifungal medication used to treat yeast infections). I am made to lay down, I lay on my back struggling to breath.</br></br>

A splitting headache begins shooting from the middle of head down my neck. Fear sets in, I think to myself, "I didn't even get the chance to say goodbye to my mother." What follows is a blur, I can only piece together.</br></br>

I remember being taken back to my cell. A day, maybe two, later my vision partially returns. I am summoned back to CTC, where I am told I have valley fever and shown x-rays of my lungs.</br></br>

My lungs looked as though a spider had spun its web in them, and was sitting in the corner of my right lung in a mass waiting to catch its next meal. Fear would sit on me like a 300 pound gorilla for the next 3+ months, while I went through treatment.</br></br>
	
Forever infected, neither my sight, nor my brain function, nor my body would feel the same again. I would later learn prison officials knew the spore that cause valley fever was in the soil of the prison, and African and Asian Americans were susceptible to the worst forms of the disease.</br></br>

Yet, officials gave us virtually no information about this disease, or how to protect ourselves. Our life long sickness and the deaths that resulted from this disease has been deemed an acceptable consequence by a society that has deemed us undesirable and expendable (see: My comments in Mother Jones Magazine [Redacted]).</br></br>
	
After nine years of exercise (mental and physical), vitamins, and only one minor relapse in 2013, I had finally begun to adjust to the havoc wrecked upon my body by valley fever. Then COVID-19!</br></br>
	
It’s February 2020, I am in San Quentin State Prison. Across the prison system there are rumblings of a sickness sweeping through Europe and predicted to hit America. From our cells we watch the news, each day the situation grows worse.</br></br>

We extract whatever details we can, about what’s going on from volunteers that enter the prison. We refuse to believe Covid is a serious threat. For after all prison officials have not said anything, nor have they stopped people from entering the prison.</br></br>

But our intuition tells us otherwise. It's the end of February, beginning March, some volunteers have begun to discontinue their rehabilitation groups out of an abundance of caution. Now the San Quentin prison population becomes alarmed.</br></br>

We discuss the situation among ourselves, still downplaying its seriousness if only to assuage our fear, but we can all feel it. Somewhere deep inside we all know that this is somehow different and unfamiliar.</br></br>

We look around and begin to take stock of the prison and its condition. We become terrified at what we see: filth, lack of proper ventilation, lack of proper sanitizing material, and decades of official autonomy and neglect. As we recognize the precariousness of our situation, we begin to speak out and complain.</br></br>

Our complaints fall on deaf ears. For those of us who are able to understand what's coming we beg prison officials to open the building's windows for ventilation. Nothing!</br></br>

We beg for proper social distancing and masks. Nothing! We beg to be released. Nothing! We beg for protection. Nothing!</br></br>

So, we sit in our small cages and wait and watch as news media documents COVID - the Angel of Death – march across the continent toward us.</br></br>

It is delivered to our doorstep on May 22, 2020, in the form of a transfer of 122 infected men from Chino State Prison to San Quentin State Prison; and all hell breaks loose: 30 dead and counting, thousands sickened and counting.</br></br>
	
On June 23rd, 2020, my harrowing ordeal began. I tested positive for the Corona Virus 2019. On June 25, I was moved to an isolation cell in the prisons hole.</br></br>

A place where men who have violated prison rules are segregated from the population. Once in that cell alone, the all too familiar feelings of impending death seized upon me once again. It was the 26th year to my incarceration [Redacted].</br></br>

I sat alone in that cell with fear as my only companion. All I could do was think "not again" and cry and beg whatever spiritual deity that was listening to spare me. I thought about all the progress I had made and the roads I had travelled.</br></br>

I thought of my blessings. My recent marriage. My beautiful, strong, independent wife, my soulmate, and newfound family.</br></br>

Would I lose it all before I even had a chance to enjoy it? I was caged at such a young age I never got the chance to taste the fullness of life through offspring. My only thoughts – Would this all end here and now?</br></br>

No one would know the terror and demons I faced in that cage. I kept it all hidden from those who loved me most. One of us suffering was enough.</br></br>
	
I remember that first night and how my breath grew shallow, and I struggled to get air into my lungs. I remember the dizzy spells. The hot and cold chills.</br></br>

The lost of taste and smell. The extreme exhaustion. I remember my throat swelling up, not being able to swallow. Though it has gone down some, to this day my throat is still swollen.</br></br> 

At the height of the infection rate my heart would pound constantly with anxiety as I heard person after person shout "Man down! I need help! Someone help me please!" I heard these shouts two, three, four times an hour.</br></br>

Fear was my constant companion during those days. It choked me, it refused to allow me a moments rest or respite. I was on edge for hours on end.</br></br>

Neither meditation nor yoga would calm me. I want to scream, to shout, to yell anything to help me escape the terror that gripped me day and night. But no relief would come.</br></br>
	
About eight weeks, my Covid symptoms began to ease some. Although, I am still not the same and doubt I ever will be, it was another twelve weeks before I began to feel some semblance of balance.</br></br>

One would think in these unprecedented times prison officials would mandate medical personnel and psychologist to examine and evaluate the entire incarcerated population. But no such decision has ever been made to date.</br></br>

In fact, I watch as officials make decision after decision which appear to be designed to spread the infection. I watched officials order whole housing units emptied in order to compact and double cell men in one unit.</br></br>

At the same time of this order, health officials were in the media constantly advising the public to social distance and wear mask. I watched as prison officials refused to open the windows in the buildings to allow ventilation, while health officials advised the public that proper ventilation helps to reduce infection rates.</br></br>

I watched as officials claimed to be deep cleaning the institution, when the only cleaning that was being done was the wiping of walls in between the cell and mopping the floor. When I asked one of the cleaners to wipe my cell door he stated "We are not allowed to touch the cell doors."</br></br>

I watched as officials told the public they were releasing non-violent men with less than six months to serve their sentence, while although some were being released, there were a lot more men meeting that criteria that were not being released.</br></br>

In fact some men were being held beyond their release date for no apparent reason, and without explanation. I could go on and on detailing the instances of officials complete and utter disregard for our health and safety, but if I did so this account would never end.</br></br>

This should not come as a surprise. We have seen it through history with the corrections department. When they were burning prisoners in Pelican Bay State Prison (see: Madrid v. Gomez, 889 F. Supp 1146; Solitary Watch 1995; California Prison Focus).</br></br>

When they were setting up and betting on gladiator fights and shooting the men fighting (see: The Independent Aug. 2nd, 1996, L.A. Times June 20th, 2020, www.prisontalk.com). When they started the street gang "he Green Wall" (see: Monterey Hearld Nov. 22nd, 2009, L.A. Times June 20, 2004).</br></br>

When they repeatedly failed to reduce California's overcrowded prison population as ordered by the Federal and US Supreme Court which has had a direct impact on the Covid-19 sicknesses and death now ravaging the prison population.</br></br>

We as a society have allowed, even sanctioned, our prison officials to act with impunity against the incarcerated population for decades and now we see the result of our decisions: sickness and death on a mass scale.</br></br>

Even now we see prison officials' disregard for life, where instead of seeking ways to prevent more sickness and death, officials are doing what they always do: seek more disingenuous ways to maintain and even increase the incarcerated population.</br></br>

This is the system in which we take so much pride and invest massive amounts of resources to maintain.
