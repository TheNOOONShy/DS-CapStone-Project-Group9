Plague year 2020/21.</br></br>

Dearest UC Irvine. Thank you very much.</br></br> 

I have already sent you a thank you card. It’s great to get mail and have a surprise. Caged people are at the mercy of the people in charge and have few decisions they can make on their own.</br></br>

Obviously, some people say, that the guards brought the virus in from outside. With their daily grind. Normal things, shopping, and getting gas.</br></br> 

I also thought that this was the chance we wouldn’t get the virus or any real problems associated with it. We were given temperature checks twice daily. I have a family member at home that believes the ray gun type have radiation. Or give off radiation potential to cause pituitary gland cancer or brain cancer, burn out of some sort.</br></br>

It does look like the ray guns that were used in the old Star Trek show.</br></br> 

Tell me the truth about this, or is it like chlorine in the water. Safer to drink, than become sick with a waterborne disease? At no time was I told I had a high temperature.</br></br>

Just the one day a correctional officer showed-up, and said “you tested "positive.” This was after I already had been moved from A-1 yard days before.</br></br> 

Then I was moved to E2 (E - yard) showers were one every two-three days. “No yard,” meals fed through the door. In the beginning I thought I had nothing of value to tell. But then I thought I should write because I was given an opportunity. Now I’m back on A yard.</br></br> 

The people around one me and myself have already been sick. I always had a good temperature and blood pressure they said so the “nurses” at least that's what they said. I think if we’ll ever get a chance to walk around outside, with fresh air, I would have felt better, I really wasn’t that sick. If I was at all.</br></br> 

Social distance we all got our own “private bunk.” I for the first time got a bottom bunk and now I hit my head all the time. Sharing a bed is grievous - awkward. Causes trouble. (Don’t talk a whole lot for trouble there) some are mourning people like myself.</br></br> 

The meanest people are night people they “weaken” in the morn the “laziness reigns supreme.” To that your safe, from any worries. Unmentionable things, plain asshole’s aka “Jamokes” I saw this word in a magazine. Drunk bunkie, syndrome. It’s not all that fun.</br></br> 

Thanks again.</br></br> 

Prisoner - yours.</br></br>

“STAY calm” till “the virus is gone.”
