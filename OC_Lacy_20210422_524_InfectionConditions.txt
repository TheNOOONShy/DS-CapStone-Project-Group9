This story was told by a person incarcerated at Theo Lacy.</br></br>

Caller: The one positive thing about what's been going on with COVID, and also what's going on- what's going on upstate, is that the different races that normally butt heads, we all- we all been getting along. There's been less violence because of- more or less because of the things going on upstate. If you want me to get into that specifically, I can.<br></br>

But as far as COVID-19, we have to go to- go into a quarantine when we first get here. For some reason- 14 days is supposed to be the minimum time in quarantine. Some people stay there only 14 days. Some people stay there for over 60 days for some reason. I-I don't know why. But I've heard stories from other inmates. Not because they've caught COVID-19 or anything, I- for some reason they get lost in the mix somewhere. Not really sure why. Is that kind of what you're looking for?</br></br>

UCI: Yeah. So, um, since people have been getting vaccinated, like, how has the vaccination situation been up there?</br></br>

Caller: There's a big- you know, there's- some people here are, um, I don't know if they're superstitious or if they're just listening to the wrong people. There seems to be less willingness of inmates to get vaccinations versus, it seems like more anti versus more pro, if that makes sense.</br></br>

I don't know if it has anything to do with education, or socio-economic backgrounds, but most people seem to just listen to whoever their big homie is or, you know, their elder, so to speak. And if someone who holds some juice in their race, you know, is anti-vaccination, then pretty much almost the whole car is anti-vaccination. Know what I mean by car?</br></br>

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: Okay, good. So that individual race would be anti-vaccination for the most part because of that.
