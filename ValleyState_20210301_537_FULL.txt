Sorry for the writing. I hope you can understand me. Thank you.</br></br>

Hello, I hope to God that you all find yourselves in good health, since those are the best wishes right after greeting you all.</br></br>

I’ll tell you my experiences that occurred because of COVID-19 in April of 2020. I have been with people who were sick with a very dangerous cold. I would see them trembling, as if they were cold, with diarrhea.</br></br> 

Others had liquids squirting out their nose. Constantly they would use up rolls of hygienic paper in less than half an hour.</br></br>

I was afraid that the same would happen to me here. No one worries for anyone else, not even those who take care of us. They do not care. They just spend their time sitting and sleeping with their dark glasses.</br></br>

You get in front of them and ask, “What do we do, there is someone sick in the dormitory?” And they respond, “What do you want me to do? I am not a doctor, I am an officer.”</br></br> 

The companions look at one another, then they separate you and put you in quarantine once or more. There is sometimes double quarantine.</br></br>

The doctors here never prescribe medicine. Not even if you tell them that your head hurts, or that you have chills. They told me that there is no medicine, it does not exist yet and we have to wait.</br></br>

For now, we are watching what is happening with this pandemic, of COVID-19. Everyday, I see that they move the sick inmates with the symptoms of COVID-19. But what happens is that they do not have experience. They mix them with those who are not sick.</br></br> 

Like me, who have not felt symptoms from this sickness and being with a lot of sick people.</br></br>

In January, I was with four people who were coughing and sneezing every minute. And the nurses knew that they were feeling bad and needed attention. I didn’t know what to do, only trying not to get too close to them, cover everything one uses; plates, spoons, cups, and even the clothes one wears daily.</br></br> 

I wash it daily with the liquid they give us to clean the floor.</br></br>

I know that the material that one has differently every month. I bless it and thank God that I haven’t gotten sick. Because only that liquid is the one that they give us, we don’t have soap, not even the ones that are cheap. Even the masks they gave us are used.</br></br> 

What can one do, but wait for a miracle from the lord. Now this year, we have faith in the new president. Since I am catholic, I believe in God and the virgin of Guadalupe, I know that soon there will be a vaccine for everyone.</br></br>

I will come out in the future, because the desperation is like we have COVID-19. The desperation of being incarcerated in a cold dark cell. Alone without seeing anyone, without knowing if your kids find themselves in good health.</br></br>

I have been so close to hurting myself, only because it’s been months without knowing about my kids. There are days when I finish my quarantine, I have a chance to be able to talk on the phone with the lady that I have two daughters with.
