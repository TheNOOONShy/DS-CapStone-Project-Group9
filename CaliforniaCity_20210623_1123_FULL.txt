Hello [Redacted]</br></br>


5-3-21</br></br>


Well I just received your letter and I would just like to say wow you found me in a website that's funny cuz I been looking for a penpal ;) and you found me in a website. Well let me tell you a little story about myself.</br></br>


I been locked up since Oct. 2019 when the pandemic just started. I didn’t think nothing of it in the beginning. But, when my friends started dying I knew it was serious, it was scary cuz I started thinking about my family.</br></br>


 It seems to me that nobody was taking it serious until the news started talking about all those people. They had us on lock down, we only got a shower and back in our cells. After a while they started letting us use the phone, which was cool. But the onlything wrong with that was I would just get bad news, another friend of mine would die from the virus.</br></br>


Last year was a sad year, for awhile I stop calling home cuz I didn’t want to hear anymore bad news. Well now its almost over, everybody in here got the shots. So were safe for now.</br></br>


Well I hope you could share this short story with others. Well I would like to know your story cuz your the one on the outside. Don’t study too hard. Take care of yourself and thank you for finding me.</br></br>


A friend [redacted]</br></br>
