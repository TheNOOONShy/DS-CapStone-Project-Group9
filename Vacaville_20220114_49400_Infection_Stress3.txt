This story was told by a person incarcerated at Vacaville.</br></br>

Caller: You know, but I believe that more can be done. If we had better care, if we had better healthcare.</br></br> 

Period. Some doctors are just not doctors. We have doctors here who – who don’t give a shit about your health.</br></br>

UCI: Wow.</br></br>

Caller: No really, really, wow. Oh my God. Wow is not the word for it. It’s unreal. It’s unreal when you have a doctor at – when you have a doctor laugh in your face and tell you it’s nothing.</br></br> 

And you know it’s so, so much more than nothing. That can be heartening – that can be disheartening, it can be heartbreaking. It’s enough to – you know, it’s unreal.</br></br>

It’s unreal. You know, we have doctors here that, you know, would not – I mean, you know, really just unreal. You know, my doctor – my pers – my PCP is not a doctor.</br></br> 

In my opinion and so many other’s opinions. He’s not a doctor, he shouldn’t be practicing medicine. Yet he’s protected under the state and that’s just all there is to it.</br></br>

There’s nothing you can do but hope for things to get better. And nothing gets better. Nothing gets better. And you suffer.</br></br> 

Like I said, I’ve been waiting over a year for a surgery. And it’s not that the surgery’s not there, it’s that my doctor – it’s a case of deliberate interference. It’s a case of deliberate indifference.
