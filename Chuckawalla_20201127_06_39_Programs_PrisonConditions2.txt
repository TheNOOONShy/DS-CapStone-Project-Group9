UCI: How long has programming been cut for?</br></br>Caller: Since it started, since COVID started. It was four or five months ago. Six months ago.</br></br>UCI: Wow.</br></br>Caller: Yeah so, the ones that we go to college, we still doing college through mail. But the ones who used to go to vocational, they are not doing anything right now. And let’s say, we did stop going with the other buildings, to have dinner or breakfast. Other than that, it’s just not safe over here.</br></br>UCI: Yeah.</br></br> Caller:  It’s just, no like I said no social distancing. Showers, we are, we still shower you know six, 10 people every shower, and it's like two, three feet away from them. When we go to dinner, you know, we have the tables right there together, you know like what four feet away from each other.</br></br> UCI: Yeah.</br></br>Caller: People per table, I guess. It’s just, somebody has to come and check what’s going on because this is not right.
