Behind these walls have become the “the Game of Thrones”. Staff are coming to work being careless not wearing mask exposing our community with the virus. Knowing we're trapped in this community to face this deadly virus. The state continues to put the inmates lives in jeopardy, transporting the men from their institute to be housed with us against our will.</br></br> 

Our staff telling us we don’t have a choice. Smothering our voices with threats of punishments or separation of our support system. Aware of the struggle and loss a lot of us have suffered by the hands of men.
