Dear PrisonPandemic team,</br></br>
First and foremost, I hope this letter finds you all in good health and cheerful spirit! And thank you for contacting me, it’s highly appreciated and spirit lifting to receive correspondence especially by people who do not know you.</br></br>
But still, they take their precious and valuable time to contact individuals like myself. I want you all to know that I take this act as an act of generosity and full of human kindness as well. I truly value and appreciate this act, thanks again.</br></br>
Now in response to your inquiry. Well, in regards to what it has been like to be inside during this difficult time. It has been difficult and very challenging. Due to the uncertainty and confusion that this pandemic has created.</br></br>
Visitation has been canceled without an unknown re-opening scheduled date, school and other recreational programs that are offered within the institution were put on hold until the end of the pandemic, “which who knows when?” Or have begun to be offered through correspondence until future notice.</br></br>
Although the pandemic did not actually hit this yard until the end of 2020, within days of the first positive, the whole yard experienced the most difficult times. Programs were shut down completely. There were no phone calls, yard or recreation time, for almost 3 months. Commission airy and care packages were not passed out. And after they began to run it again, several items have a limit on them due to the pandemic shortage.</br></br>
Also, one of the first positive cases began to appear in the yard. Several buildings were considered quarantine buildings and our building was the main quarantine building. So whatever was housed in this building, it was immediately relocated without even being tested.</br></br>
Although medical staff and other personnel were advised that some of us had some of the symptoms related to the COVID-19 virus. They’re only response was to pack our property and go wherever they were sending us, and once relocated we would follow up the medical process to be tested. Because unfortunately tests were low at the given moment, and the CDCR personnel were instructed to follow their superiors orders.</br></br>
Yeah, most of the CDCR personnel were instructed to relocate us and were very cooperative and up to certain points very helpful as well. But most of them were as confused as we were.</br></br>
Nevertheless, there was only so much they could do themselves. As a result of this, we were Relocated throughout the yard and a massive spread of COVID-19 was ignited throughout the yard and at one time or another every building was placed in quarantine. Also those that were relocated lost their jobs, educational, and self-help group assessments. Along with personal belongings and most importantly communication with their loved ones.</br></br>
This was around the middle of the pandemic. These moments have been some of the worst and most stressful moments of my life since I have been incarcerated. And has also taught me to value life and live every moment as the last minute of my life. Because, I have lost family members and loved ones to this pandemic, that were not supposed to be gone this early. Throughout this chaotic period of time, I have built my resistance and developed some very hopeful coping mechanisms all through constant reading of self-help books, exercise/working out, and keeping a positive mindset.</br></br>
Now that things have been more mellow, once vaccines were approved, CDCR began to vaccinate us as well. I was one of the first individuals to be vaccinated, and slowly but surely the program began to run again. Another positive impact that this pandemic has brought to me is the restoration of long lost relationships with loved ones and friends.</br></br>
I have been incarcerated for almost 12 years and before my incarceration I was not in my best behavior, nor contacting myself to some of my family members' expectations of standards. So I either distance myself from them or they distance themselves from me. However, recently I was able to make peace with some of them after all these years. It feels good to be on good terms with them and has also helped me cope with everything else that has been going on. Here with this virus.</br></br>
This pandemic has opened my eyes to be able to see what has always been right in front of me, but yeah I was unable to see. Throughout this period of time I have been constantly reflecting on past experiences and I am currently working on furthering my education and preparing for my upcoming board hearing. This is actually my first time that I am appearing in front of the board members to appeal to them for my release. A second chance should I say.</br></br>
I am a 35-year-old individual who has not always been the person that I am today. At the age of 13 years old I left my home and began to get involved with the wrong crowd and adopted a criminal lifestyle. A lifestyle that at the age of 23 years old led me to commit a crime for which I was handed a life sentence in prison. A lifestyle that I am not proud of.</br></br>
Anyhow, this is pretty much what I can contribute to what you inquire about. Thanks again, and feel free to publish whatever is good for a study and also to stop by whenever you please.</br></br>
Respectfully yours,
