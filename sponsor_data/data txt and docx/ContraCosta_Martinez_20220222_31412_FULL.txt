UCI: What has the COVID-19 situation been like at your facility?</br></br>

Caller: It’s been pretty hectic. We’ve had two outbreaks with COVID, both brought in by deputy police officers. And through those times, we haven’t really been given cleaning supplies. We haven’t been properly quarantined.</br></br>

The last COVID outbreak we had was about two weeks ago, and a couple people tested positive, and they left the people in the module with us, but they just gave them a different free time. But it wasn’t properly protecting us because during food service, all our slots are open, we’re touching the same slots. Our free times are still in the same area. We just – it wasn’t separated or segmented, so we all – everybody ended up getting COVID.</br></br>

I got COVID and was having problems with my asthma. I was telling nurses that I felt like, at times, I couldn’t breathe. And they just was telling me, “Oh, it’s just the COVID. You should write to the doctor, maybe they can give you Ibudol” and different stuff like that.</br></br>

Like, we have a day where we do laundry exchange, and they’re still going into inmates’ cells and not changing their gloves. Knowing that we have a COVID outbreak, and going to everybody else’s cells and touching their bedding, their food, all their personal hygienes and stuff like that. So it's been pretty hectic here. We haven’t been properly protected, I feel like.</br></br>

UCI: How has the vaccination situation been like at your facility?</br></br>

Caller: I mean, they came in with vaccinations. But I had a problem with the vaccinations. I don’t know if it was kind of like a big problem.</br></br> 

I was kind of asking questions on the vaccinations, like what the different ones and what are in them and stuff like that. And I was only told about the Moderna vaccination, so I got the Moderna vaccination.</br></br>

I was never informed about any other ones. And then, after I got the vaccination, I had deputies coming up to me telling me, “Oh, you should never have got Moderna, you should have got Pfizer.” I was kind of like, “I asked all these questions like, is there any other ones, but they kept telling me it was only Moderna.”</br></br>

But they offered it to us. Some people got it, some people didn’t. Some people had to write to get it. It’s kind of been on and off.</br></br>

UCI: How the COVID situation at your facility affected your loved ones?</br></br>

Caller: It’s kind of affected them pretty hard. I haven’t even seen my son. I have a one-year-old son. I haven’t even seen my son in about a month or so because of COVID reasons.</br><br>

I don’t know if this is true, but there was a person on the module who got COVID, and he was one of the first people to get it. He said he got it through the visiting. We’ve got glass visitation with these little holes at the bottom. He said he probably got it through those visitor holes.</br></br>

And my family hasn’t wanted to come up here because they feel like they’re not properly getting protected. Like, they don’t clean the visiting rooms, or anything like that. And before that before they opened the in-person visits, we had Zoom visits. But the Zoom visits were only for 10 minutes.</br></br> 

We only got to visit our family for 10 minutes every two weeks. So it wasn’t even like you really got to see them or even enough time to talk to them and check on them to see how they’re doing.</br></br>

UCI: What has it been like for you to have reduced visitation and programming?</br></br>

Caller: It’s actually pretty hard being in the county jail. Twenty one hours locked down and three hours of free time. It’s actually my first time ever being in trouble in my whole entire life. So it’s kind of – it’s been pretty hard because I’m family-oriented and I’m a first-time father.</br></br> 

I only got to spend five days with my son so not being able to see him and hold him and spend time with him and not being really able to communicate with my loved ones just ‘cause due to COVID reasons is pretty hard. It’s pretty stressful. It’s pretty depressing.</br></br>

UCI: How have you been coping with all this going on?</br></br>

Caller: I'm sorry, one more time?</br></br>

UCI: How have you been coping with all this going on?</br></br>

Caller: How have I been coping with it? It’s kind of just – kind of just make the best of it. I just read and write letters. Sometimes I write to mental health, sometimes I talk to them but it’s kind of hard to talk to them sometimes. I just kind of happen to tough it out, suck it up, and just deal with the punches that have been thrown at me.</br></br>

UCI: What do you think would have made the situation at your facility better?</br></br>

Caller: Well, I heard that a lot of other county jails are getting tablets or they get to have tablets during free time hours. They get to talk to family or they get them from a certain period of time like from 8:00 to 5:00 p.m. That would’ve helped a lot. ‘Cause with COVID and everything, some people have family members who have immune deficit issues or they’re older.</br></br> 

Like, I can’t even see my grandma from here. I feel like it would have made it better if they could give us tablets or figure out a way for us to either get more time to communicate with our family or – yeah, all I can think of is probably tablets.</br></br>

UCI: Well, what else – go ahead.</br></br>

Caller: Measures. Or safer measures like cleaning the visitation rooms and cleaning up where they come up at and stuff like that.</br></br>

UCI: What else do you want people to know about your experience?</br></br>

Caller: I just want people to know that this is not a good place. I feel like the jail system isn’t working. Before my situation – I’m 23 years old, I’ve been in jail for 18 months. This is my first time ever coming to jail. I was a firefighter before this, I was going to college.</br></br>

They said I did something a long time ago, but it's kind of like me being in this situation isn’t helping me. In a bad sense it's making me a worse person because I’m around all these people. It’s like I have to be tougher. I can’t express myself.</br></br> 

I have to act like things are okay when they’re really not. It’s turning me into a more heartless person, especially dealing with the deputies.</br></br>

I don't know if I can say this or not, but deputies treat you like shit. I have medical problems and deputies told me they don’t do anything for being – I don’t know if I can say this either, but – being pussies. Like, you don’t do anything for pussies and – it’s just not a good experience. It isn’t helping anybody, I feel like this is making people turn worser when they should be doing something to help people.</br></br>

I’ve been trying to go to school while I’m in here. I haven’t even got that option. I’ve been trying to do certain things and it’s not available to me so even if I wanted – even if I was a shitty person and I was a bad person and I wanted to better myself I don’t even get that opportunity to better myself for when I do come home and reenter the world.</br></br>
