This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Soledad.</br></br>Dear PrisonPandemic,</br></br>Good day to you. May this missive find you and your fellow students doing great. I received your thank you card today. As men behind bars, we don’t know exactly what your project is doing, but we’re grateful for whatever you’re doing.</br></br>The prison isn’t back to normal yet, but many of us, like myself, who never tested positive during the outbreak, have got the Pfizer vaccine shot twice. We are still tested once a week and those who did not test positive back in November, December, and January are now receiving the vaccine shot.</br></br>It saddens me that 12 inmates had to die while thousands more tested positive and got sick. It was 100 percent preventable but the warden was lackadaisical, while his employees were remiss and defiant when it came to them wearing a mask.</br></br>I will be paroling in four months if your project would like an in-depth interview.</br></br>Thanks for your time and have an awesome day.</br></br>Respectfully.
