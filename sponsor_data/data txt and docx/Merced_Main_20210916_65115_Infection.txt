This story was told by a person incarcerated at Merced County Jail.</br></br> 

UCI: And it hasn't, I'm just trying to emphasize, it hasn't changed at all since the beginning of the pandemic?</br></br>

Caller: No, ma'am. We are always getting, like, memos that are going to, "On such and such date, we're going to need to start such and such." But in the meantime, somebody else has came down with COVID. So, then we have to start all over again.</br></br> 

Like, we have to be COVID free for so long before they do certain things. And we can never make it to that COVID free part because officers or free staff, you know, they go out there, get sick, and then bring it back in. Or not sick but a carrier, or however it works.</br></br>

UCI: Do you see a lot of correctional staff taking all of the precautions seriously?</br></br>

Caller: So, our feeding, the way that we're supposed to be fed is, like, total PPE, you know, gowns, gloves, eye protection, mask, whatever. And I think maybe one out of 10 do it that way.</br></br> 

Like, our last scare or the last was a physical therapist, which is, you know, the doctor, and then two staff officers came down with COVID. Because I guess they have to test prior to coming in, and it's a rapid test or whatever. And so, then we're back on lockdown again.
