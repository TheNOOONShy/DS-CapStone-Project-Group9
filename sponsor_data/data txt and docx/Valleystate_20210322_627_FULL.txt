This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Valley State.</br></br>COVID-19’s hidden victims,</br></br>I am serving a life term in the California Correctional System and have 21 years in. I am now 43 years old. Yep I came to prison at the age of 22. Just a lost kid on a lost path. I’ve seen such evils over the years and even more heartbreaking isolation.</br></br>I once went 10 years between visits with my mother. How I missed the comfort of my mother’s hug even as a grown man. My mom has health issues that limit the ability to travel. So I programmed and stayed out of trouble so I could transfer to Valley State Prison.</br></br> 

Putting me closer to her and allowing for us to have visits.</br></br>Unfortunately, her health condition has worsened over the last two years so visits have slowed down. I had a visit appointment for mid-March 2020. COVID-19 had already been chipping away at our programs in here like: work assignments, education, self-help programs, access to dayroom, and yard activities. One-by-one these programs were shut down.</br></br>Then the unthinkable happened. Visitation was suspended until further notice days before I was to have my visit. Nearly a year later there aren’t contact visits. As of about two months ago they started to offer 30-minute video visits.</br></br>This is only helpful to those who have access to or know how when it comes to technology. My mother is 77 and she doesn’t know how to use a smart phone. The inability to have that physical contact with a loved one is a strain. The strain is placed on all relationships especially with your wife or girlfriend.</br></br>I, along with other inmates, have lost these relationships due to the extra strain of lack of visits, access to phone calls, and how slow mail is processed. This is what COVID has done. Made our isolation even more extreme here in prison. This is just the isolation aspect of this pandemic.</br></br>Then inmates started to get sick. It was a wildfire that spread throughout a building in the blink of an eye. You can’t social distance when the facility is operating at 180 percent capacity. When you cram eight men in a cell designed to house six women, it becomes a breeding ground for a virus like COVID.</br></br>The prison officials were panicking, placing restriction upon restriction on inmates. Inmates were mandated to wear masks while correctional officers were not. That made no sense as it was the officers who were bringing COVID inside the prison.</br></br>Us inmates have been treated with much more animosity than usual because officers were getting sick and of course it must be inmates’ faults. I heard officers say “Who gives a shit if inmates get COVID. I am only concerned about us in green”, referring to other officers. More and more of us inmates felt as if we were being punished for COVID outbreaks.</br></br>Infected inmates were sent to an isolation building and their pod-mates, seven other inmates, would be sent to two-week quarantine in two-man cells. Only to be kicked out, not to their old building, but to a random building on a random yard. This further added to the extreme isolation growing in the inmate population. As the few friends and closeness one develops in a housing unit was broken.</br></br>The stress of someone getting sick and then being sent away was unbearable. So when people were getting sick, they tried to hide it and by doing so would spread the infection. We test weekly and you hold your breath for three days hoping you are not sick and if you refuse to test you are sent away to quarantine.</br></br>There were times when they would kick an inmate who tested positive out of isolation only to have that whole pod or cell test positive the following week. We started to believe the prison was trying to get inmates sick in order to build a “herd immunity”. Inmates were getting fed up. There were whispers of mass resistance against COVID testing and moving to quarantine cells.</br></br>One building had a majority of the inmates refuse testing and the whole building was isolated for nearly two months. No access to phones or outside activities. This is how they forced us to comply, threaten what little freedoms we had left.</br></br>We broke. We complied. Not because it was the right thing to do but because we really had no choice.</br></br>Speaking of choice, we were finally offered a vaccine. A lot of inmates took it. Not due to a want or trust that it was safe to do, but out of fear and the feeling of not having a real choice.</br></br>I took the shot. Not because I wanted to but for the lack of choice. I thought “What option do I really have? Not take it, get sick, and possibly die or take it and hope it protects me and it was safe.” Most of the guys I talk to felt this way.</br></br>I understand the need to vaccinate and be socially responsible, but as an inmate we are at the mercy of prison officials and correctional officers to keep us safe. They failed. Inmates and correctional officers died.</br></br>The only difference is us inmates get to die alone with no love or support. No comfort. Why? Because prison is overcrowded and correctional officers were not responsible. All the pain we inmates endured and continue to endure will be forgotten.</br></br>We suffer in silence and we hold resentment and anger. Not at society or medical professionals but at the prison system that is overcrowded and ill-equipped to handle a mass medical crisis. These are the thoughts and a point of view of an inmate surviving a pandemic in prison.</br></br>I am thankful UCI is collecting stories about the effects of COVID in prisoners. That there will be a record of the human cost paid in prison. I, like others in prison, are coping by simply having hope.</br></br>We also develop strong personal bonds with other inmates. We create micro families and support each other. We survive and look to better days. We are human. We matter. We just are.</br></br>With all honesty.
