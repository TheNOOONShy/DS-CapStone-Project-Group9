This story was told by a person incarcerated at Soledad.</br></br>Caller: I’ve never had COVID. I’ve never tested positive. I’ve been subjected to more psychological abuse, trauma. We had 40 weeks of cold food in CDC in the year 2020.</br></br>The other thing they do is they move people around that are infected and they keep reinfecting other people. That’s why the COVID numbers are up. At this prison we have 16 inmates that died, I knew 12 of them. We also had four officers die.</br></br>The management team here sucks. You tell them something, it takes them three weeks to react. It doesn’t matter if they’re a captain, a AW, a warden, everybody’s got an excuse for why we’re suffering here.</br></br>The only thing that we benefitted from was the stimulus check. And you can’t even spend that money cause you can’t even get in the store. We ask for hygiene supplies, they tell us, “Oh we put in a order.” Our sheets haven’t been washed in a month, our blankets in three to four months.</br></br>Some people come in here, oh they are doing transportation moves from other places. Guys that went out to court, they’re putting them in prisons that are not even the prisons they were endorsed. So their property is sitting at another prison while they’re over here.
