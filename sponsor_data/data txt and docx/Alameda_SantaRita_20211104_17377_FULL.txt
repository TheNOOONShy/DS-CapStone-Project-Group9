This story was told by a person incarcerated at Santa Rita Jail.</br></br>

UCI: You can go ahead and start off wherever you like. I know you already started off a little bit, but if you want to continue on.</br></br>

Caller: Yes. This is affecting everybody, especially during the pandemic. That now that jails are more so, more emptier than they are they were once upon a time a lot of them were full. These public defenders, district attorneys, these judges, and California law enforcement officials have been doing some of the most heinous, flagrantly violated of expressed constitutional prohibitation, in trying to cause recidivism to continually derive off the support of the income of what the recidivism rates revolving door of continuing repeat offenders would do for them financially.</br></br>

So, I have a preliminary hearing transcript of [redacted], and the date of my preliminary hearing is March, 2019. I showed up fraudulently in two databases. The County CLETS, which is California Law Enforcement Telecommunication Systems database, as a active probationer with a [unintelligible] search clause.</br></br>

I also show up falsely in the County database of the CRIMS, which is the Criminal Records Imaging Management Systems database, as an AB109 county supervision-er CDCR parolee with a four-way search clause, seizure clause condition stipulation. I'm not on either one of them.</br></br>

And they illegally searched, seized me, searched a car that I wasn't driving, that was parked because they found the key in my pocket conducting a fraudulent probationary search. Went into the - went to the car, that - that the key was attributed to, stuck the key into the door, opened it, saw that it worked, found a semi-automatic handgun, and then if the car is not even registered in my name, they took me to jail and then they found out I wasn't on parole or probation in either county.</br></br>

And now they're trying to forcibly make take a plea bargain, and because I won't take it, they have illegally court ordered me to [redacted] State Hospital to be involuntarily medicated without me ever being interviewed by one psychiatric professional of the two required under California State Law Penal Code Section 1368 and 1369. During the pandemic, this is what they're doing at Santa Rita County Jail.</br></br>

And that's in [redacted], too. Well, that's basically [unintelligible] my story and this data, these two databases have been illegally [unintelligible] for the last 17 years as [redacted] of the county probation officer as a supervisor testified too in my preliminary hearing.</br></br> 

And even though he admits that there's no safeguarding system to ensure that - that the databases are, well, only pertaining to CLETS is accurate retentions of information, they are still insisting that I either take a plea bargain. And because I won't take a plea bargain, they claim that I'm incompetent to stand trial fraudulently to make me take a plea bargain.</br></br>

So they're using the mental health state hospital as a means of forcibly making criminal court case defendants accept their plea bargaining during the pandemic. That's how desperate they are to have a means of warehousing people's bodies since the jails and prisons are becoming so empty. And that's it.</br></br>

UCI: Thank you so much for sharing that. I'm so sorry to hear you're going through all of that.</br></br>

Caller: Oh, yeah. And the people that are helping me out really a lot with it are the [redacted].</br></br>

She's been providing me a lot of assistance because she doesn't agree with what they're doing to me either, and she's read my transcripts and have now written a letter to the Alameda County Public Defender's Office, the head Public Defender, my public defender, and my former public defender.</br></br>

So, yeah, I would hope that you guys would publicize this. Because these databases are affecting and victimizing the public's interest and the United States citizens of the State of California as long as they're being allowed to continuously be inaccurate in violation of your Fourth Amendment rights. If they're errored and you're believed to be on probation during a routine traffic stop, they're going to illegally search, seize you, falsely arrest you, and temporarily or possibly, continuously have you falsely imprisoned during the pandemic. So how was that?</br></br>

UCI: That's a horrible story, but thank you for sharing it with us.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, because, see, you guys, see, verify what I'm saying to be true if you guys wanted to even go even further with your publication.</br></br>

UCI: I'm not too sure what exactly what happens after the step of, I'm just on the step of actually answering the calls and getting them recorded. I know it's more of a archive, so it's, like, your information will get posted and then it's up to the viewers to see what they want to do with the information.</br></br>

Caller: Oh, okay.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: So can I find out how it does?</br></br>

UCI: I mean, you're welcome to look at the website. The - it's called PrisonPandemic. Yeah, it's just called PrisonPandemic the website, and then hopefully the story will come out there, but because we do try to keep it anonymous, there's not really a way for you to look up your own story unless you go through the stories, if that makes sense.</br></br>

Caller: Oh, okay, okay.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah. So, like, a lot of the-</br></br>

Caller: Oh, I got to read them.</br></br>

UCI: I'm sorry. Go ahead.</br></br>

Caller: I would have to go through them and read it, huh?</br></br>

UCI: Yeah. And then because it is - we try to keep it as anonymous as possible, I know a lot of, like, the identifying information will get blurred out, but they'll definitely get to hear all of the other parts the, yeah, just not like the identifying numbers like your case numbers are anything like that.</br></br>

Caller: Oh, they won't - oh, they won't let that be on there?</br></br>

UCI: No, because, yeah, that's one of our - I don't know what the word is, like a motto. Like, we just want to keep it as anonymous as possible to keep all of the people who get interviewed as comfortable and as - as safe as possible.</br></br>

Caller: Well, what if I don't have a problem with it?</br></br>

UCI: I can make that a note when I upload it to our system, but that I know of, everything gets blurred, yeah, like all your identifying information just because that - that's just how they do all the stories. But I'll definitely make a note of it on there and see if by any chance they can leave that information on there, but I think that it's, like, required by the - the founders of the program.</br></br>

Caller: Okay.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, but I would prefer that it wouldn't be blurred out, but if they have to, then that's fine. I just want people to know that those databases, they - they use those throughout the, you know, California, those two databases, law enforcement.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, I think the database names will stay on there, just the, you know, like your personal information on how to find you on those databases that won't be on there.</br></br>

Caller: Okay.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, but they'll definitely get to hear that basically. I'm sorry?</br></br>

Caller: It will get out there that the databases aren't - aren't accurate because the public doesn't even know it. They've been keeping it a secret for a long time.</br></br>

UCI: I hear you.</br></br>

Caller: So you're actually a student?</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, I'm a student here at UCI.</br></br>

Caller: Oh, okay.  Yeah, well, yeah, that's my story. I really appreciate your time.</br></br>

UCI: Thank you so much for calling. I hope you are able to find your story once it gets posted. It does take a little bit of a while, but, yeah, if you ever want to look up the website, you can go ahead and look it up and hopefully you'll find your story there.</br></br>

Caller: Okay. You have a nice day, huh?</br></br>

UCI: Thank you. You, too. Bye-bye.</br></br>

Caller: All right. Bye-bye.
