Hello UCI student,</br></br>

Allow me to introduce myself. My name is [redacted]. Yesterday I received a letter from your UCI PrisonPandemic outreach team. Not only am I thankful, I’m also grateful to have an opportunity to share my personal experience about how the COVID-19 has affected me.</br></br> 

Now should you or any of your fellow class members wish to know more about me, or rather how it is to be incarcerated as a whole, please reach out to me. I do hope my experience is able to shed light upon your questions. Once again thank you for this opportunity.</br></br>

I also included a few documents to back up my story and also share with you my personal notes I’ve been taking for many months. I hope they will help you out. Also, I’d appreciate feedback or an update on how this project is coming along. Thank you. Be safe.</br></br>

Dear PrisonPandemic,</br></br>

As I sit within this prison cell a recurring thought often visits my mind. How did a virus from China make its way into my personal space?</br></br>

I remember when I first saw it on the news. All it was, was a flu-like virus spreading in a place named Wuhan. Of course, I didn’t pay no attention to it. Why would I?</br></br> 

After all, I’m in a prison cell in a little city known as Soledad, California. At the time, Wuhan seemed so very far away. With all the miles, borders, countries, and continents between us, the possibilities of this particular virus reaching me seemed a flat out zero.</br></br>

Even when I heard a news report about similar deaths taking place in Washington State it still didn’t alert me that much. Especially when President Trump was downplaying it on a consistent basis. Plus during my incarceration I began attending church, AA, various self help groups. I was even attending on-site Hartnell College classes.</br></br>

Along with these educational and spiritual programs I held a job in a PIA textiles. And enjoyed playing sports such as basketball, soccer, handball, and softball. Yes, I had a busy schedule all keeping me programming in a positive manner. With this constant flow of productive energy COVID-19 really didn’t register with me.</br></br> 

How could it? I was attuned with getting my mind right. That meant getting rid of toxic masculinity, overcoming years of addiction, plus other bad habits.</br></br>

Over the last eight years while incarcerated I have spent many hours of dealing with my issues. With all the time spent in these various groups I have developed bonds and friendships. All that has completely stopped. Why?</br></br> 

COVID-19 has finally made its way onto our prison grounds.</br></br>

We are no longer able to have groups. Which means we are not gathering together in a structured setting that allows us to be open with one another. It really is amazing that within prison walls we have found a space to be real and genuine about our bad messed up behaviors. During this pandemic I have begun to feel isolated.</br></br>

I believe the prison I’m in has been affected since March. That’s 10 months of being stuck inside a cell. In the beginning, I was fortunate enough to go to work. Being that I’m assigned to textiles I was part of a working force that made hundreds of thousands of cloth masks.</br></br> 

At that time I felt extremely purposeful. Especially knowing that our masks were being distributed throughout California.</br></br>

I recently heard that some men have passed away from COVID-19 here at this prison. I know a few of them personally. As a matter of fact, I have even prayed with some of them. The sad reality is that more are going to pass away here. Today the prison I’m in has the most infections within the California state.</br></br>

Yes, we are often tested. Once a week, in fact. And it’s scary to find out men within your own building are positive. It leaves you to wonder: Am I next?</br></br>

Since I don’t receive visits that part hasn’t affected me. But I do know many men in here who do and it has caused them to become very lonesome for their family and loved ones. Especially, for the men who are qualified to receive family visits. That’s when a man’s wife and kids can come and spend a couple of nights under the same roof with him.</br></br> 

But it also can be his parents or siblings. Although I never experienced those days, the men that have, have been re-established.</br></br>

So, yeah, COVID has had a tremendous effect upon me. Even to the point of having concerns pertaining my release date. See, I am scheduled to be released in June of 2022. Who’s to say this virus will be over with by then?</br></br>

That’s in the distance, the here and now is all I need to worry about. So, I wear my mask when I exit the cell. I practice social distance outside of the cell. I wash my hands often.</br></br> 

Yet, it remains in my mind that COVID-19 is lurking in the air. Like an enemy waiting to catch me slipping. My other thought is if I was to get it, what would it do to me? Some only say they have lost taste and smell.</br></br> 

Some say they felt nothing, yet tested positive. While others have died.</br></br>

Imagine that phone call.</br></br>

“Sorry to inform you your husband, son, brother, dad has just died from COVID-19.”</br></br>

Yeah, a scary thought, for sure.</br></br>

Let us all continue to be safe and remain vigilant.</br></br>

Sincerely.</br></br>

COVID-19 notes</br></br>

August 10, 2020: All PA workers were sent to back to wings. Workers were informed by custody that only G-wing would be going to work. Once in wing, we were informed that showers would run one cell at a time per their own tier.</br></br>

That our wing would be placed on a two-week quarantine. No movement in or out of wing. Furthermore, we were told that all essential critical workers would be placed in G-wing during this two weeks. At the moment, there’s no infected inmates in F, G, or X-wing. Nor Z-wing.</br></br>

There’s no reasonable sense in placing all critical workers in one wing. There’d be too many workers coming back from work at the same time. There’d be no way to keep any social distance within such a crowded space. It’s more of a risk to my personal health than remaining in E-wings quarantine.</br></br>

August 17, 2020: There have been reportedly eight to 11 more confirmed positive tested inmates in CTF Central as of today. They, CTF Central, have been running yard for the infected wings B, C, D. Why are these wings allowed to yard if there’s known confirmed cases in there?</br></br>

Also, along with G, F-wing is now going to work. If it’s not safe for soc or education classes to run, why is PIA still up and running? Is the value of a dollar that a PIA makes more important than the life of a family’s loved one working there? Rather it be staff or inmate.</br></br>

August 21, 2020: Black inmate dies today in D-wing. At this moment I haven’t heard from what. This cellmate is still in the same cell.</br></br>
