To: whom it may concern at UC Irvine. Everyone involved in the PrisonPandemic Project.</br></br>

Hello. My friend received a letter, which he asked if perhaps I’d be interested in writing. There wasn’t a chance that I would miss out on this opportunity to write and share a bit of my personal experience with anyone interested, and cared enough to write and ask. I couldn’t be more grateful, thank you!</br></br>

To share my personal experience regarding this current pandemic, I’d need to give you a really brief summary to my current situation. I’ve been incarcerated going on 18 years now. I was 19 years old when I committed a gang related shooting, which unfortunately resulted in someone’s death. Although the victim came to my house to threaten my life, I nonetheless was responsible, nor am I minimizing the severity in taking someone else’s life.</br></br>

I was born and raised in east Los Angeles. I grew up in one of Los Angeles County’s roughest neighborhoods, and government housing project. So it’s of no surprise that I, like so many in my community, grew up influenced by my surroundings; which were deeply embedded in gang culture, drugs, and the consequences this type of environment comes with...heavy police presence both good and bad. Honest and corrupt policing.</br></br>

My first time incarcerated was at 12 years old for gang related assaults and robbery. This became the beginning of a life behind bars. By the age of 15, Los Angeles County was fed up with chance after chance in their juvenile halls, and county juvenile camps. Which had only made things worse, as bad a place these places were.</br></br>

Kids sent here were either scared straight from being victimized or were simply hardened. So here I was at 15 years old, being sent to California’s Youth Authority (CYA).</br></br>

CYA is California’s prison for kids, and much worser than the county juvenile halls, and detention camps. Go figure why California’s politicians finally shut all CYA’s down, which at one point numbered about ten.</br></br>

I’d parole four years later at the age of 19. Even more hardened than before. I was really young and even more ignorant than I could have imagined. Unfortunately, it would take me all these years in prison for me see things in a different perspective to finally understand what I wish I should of all this time.</br></br>

I’ve spent my time in prison reading, studying, and educating myself as much as possible. My curiosity led me to learn enough about the law, to litigate my own writs, and to take advantage of the changing laws, and was able to receive a favorable ruling to be called back in hopes of changing my now eligibility for parole into a parole. All due to the newly enacted youth offender laws.</br></br>

I arrived to the Orange County jail from Kern Valley State Prison on April 2020. About a little over a month after California shut down, so I got to experience what it was like in prison and in the county jail at the beginning of the coronavirus 19 pandemic.</br></br>

Having watched the pandemic spread from Wuhan, China throughout southeast Asia, then all of Asia, then Europe, before reaching the United States, at first felt unreal. Like most here in the U.S, it all seemed a world away, but with everyday passing by and witnessing its deadly destruction in Italy; this far away feeling turned into this surreal feeling of worry.</br></br>

About our loved ones, family we haven’t had a chance to see lately. My mother, now 76 years old, whom I’ve hadn’t had the opportunity in seeing now for over eight years, now at risk of being sick and dying. As hard as a reality as it may, with nothing I could possibly do to help, was scary. It’s still scary!</br></br>

To sit in prison where officials had yet to offer anyone face masks as of April 22, 2020, was no surprise. There’s a very old “inside joke”, I’m sure any person who’s ever been incarcerated is familiar with. To go to medical at any of the state and county correctional facilities for any kind of medical issue, big or small, just to have the medical staff tell us to “drink lots of water.”</br></br>

Like if water in here is a magic medicine that cures everything. This is how bad our medical system behind bars is. It’s extremely difficult to receive the proper help you need. Imagine now how scary it feels to find oneself behind bars knowing how inadequate our medical care is.</br></br>

I’ll tell you one thing though, it’s certainly not so funny now. No one wants to drink lots of water, and hope it cures anyones COVID-19 infection. Not me at least. Yet that’s exactly what happened.</br></br>

Arriving to the county jail I felt at least I’d be closer to my loved ones, and perhaps be able to receive some visits from my mom and sisters and nephew, nieces I’ve yet to meet. I was excited about that. Having had my visiting privileges suspended the past two years with one more to go while in state prison. This suspension didn’t affect me in county jail.</br></br>

I wasn’t the only one excited. My family, friends, and girlfriend were all so excited too. All hoping they’d see me soon, aside from the obvious of the chance to be home soon too. But the excitement quickly turned into anguish, frustration, extremely stressful, and scared of course.</br></br>

Though scared is an emotion one rarely shows in an environment where being scared can be seen as a sign of weakness others can abuse, and sadistic mind games for others to entertain. Still, it’s kind of impossible not to feel this fear within for a disease not seen yet, its deadly havoc is clear for anyone to see.</br></br>

I don’t care how many tattoos you got, or whether you’re a badass tough guy, a gangster, this invisible viral infection fears no one and scares us all. No one wants to die. We all have someone or something to live for, and even if you didn’t think so, believe me we all do. Something about death seems to put things into perspective.</br></br>

The sudden thought of urgent death brings out my appreciation for life and for all its beauty. I never had kids, having spent most of my life behind bars. But I’d think the love I have for my parents is how I’d feel. Love is beautiful and something I want more of.</br></br>

I love life and I sure don’t want it to end, nor end the life of those. I love all of a sudden, I appreciate life so much more, and have a newly found urgency to live life for. Which makes the situation that much scary. Back in here, things aren’t all too well.</br></br>

Visits still are not permitted, outbreaks through the Orange County continue to occur. One such occurrence took place in early December. When a cellmate of mine went to court and was placed in a holding cell with others; inmates housed throughout different locations at the jail.</br></br>

Unfortunately, some of these guys were infected by deputy’s working their housing location. I am sure I don’t need to explain just how infectious COVID-19 is, and was on this particular occasion. My cellmate became ill soon after. We all knew he was infected and we were all so damn pissed!</br></br>

For we knew despite everything we try, and we did, we knew it was only a matter of when. Imagine living inside a cell with someone who is infected? Yes we notified medical staff but let me tell you how medical staff as well as the entire Orange County sheriff department cared more about hiding the true facts from the general public then it was to contain and defeat it.</br></br>

Having had numerous legal lawsuits, they were fighting their number one priority was to try and deceive everyone as if their jail system was safe and had protections in place. So when someone complains about COVID-19 related symptoms, they’d try to test anyone as a last resort, if that person showed severe signs of illness.</br></br>

Then if that person was found to have COVID-19, he’d be put in a pod with infected inmates quarantined. They wouldn’t go back to where he or she was housed to test everyone to try and contain a potential outbreak. So that on paper, these numbers looked low.</br></br>

This was their way of doing things at first, before even this was exposed and they were forced to change. As my cellmate got sicker, I began to get sick too, because my cellmate’s symptoms were bad and we both were tested and sent to quarantine.</br></br>

No medecine, no doctors checking on us, just a whole cell block also called “pods”, full of COVID-19 positive infected inmates separated from the rest. No medical staff, nor medical housing, nothing! So much for finding comfort in knowing we’d be okay!</br></br>

Although my symptoms was only a few days of flu like symptoms, my celly and others however were much worse! Even then they were told they couldn’t do nothing else since they weren't to the point of no return, pretty much.</br></br>

I felt helpless and alone. I’ve felt things I ain’t ever felt in all these years incarcerated. This pandemic really brought/caused so much mental distress and fear. I sympathize for those whose fears got the best of them. The fear only to be made even more real, when someone you know has succumbed to this deadly virus.</br></br>

Tragedy struck on two different occasions for me. On October of 2020, and January 2021, two people whose lives personally meant something special to me died from complications from this novel coronavirus. It’s not easy. This whole year past hasn’t been easy, not at the slightest bit.</br></br>

It’s hard enough soldiering on with the everyday business of incarceration, and now the heavy burden of having to mentally cope with this coronavirus pandemic, it’s tough. Imagine, like most in the county jail, who are stuck in limbo with their pending court cases; most sitting in jail because they can’t afford to make bail.</br></br>

Instead, the courts have all but shut down more less, if like many went to their initial arraignment and took their public defender’s advice to postpone and waived their right to a speedy trial. They’re now on the court’s time, and can wait indefinitely legally. Which the courts have exercised, this past year.</br></br>

Now to sit in jail with the weight of just being away from family, loved ones, and friends. Most fighting charges that can possibly send them away for decades for something that should only be a couple years at most.</br></br>

Take this example really quick. I’m a few cells away from a 26 year old african american who just received 25 years to life sentence for a violent third strike for a mutual fight, caught on camera, which he didn’t initiate. Even the victim said so. But simply because he is Black in Orange County, he was struck out.</br></br>

Myb current celly (cellmate) also assaulted a man much more violently, though he is not black. He received seven years with half who’s also a third striker. The criminal justice system is indeed biased and extremely unfair.</br></br>

So imagine all this on top of everything else. I come back to visits, where visits is our only true real getaway from this place of horror, of misery! So to have this one equalizer in our lives taken from us, really takes its toll.</br></br>

I’m so close to so many of my family and friends, but limited to calls and letters. It’s not only agonizing but creates this indescribable rage, knowing it’s also now being manipulated under the guise of COVID-19 health and safety protocol restrictions.</br></br>

To tell someone who’s personally aware about officials callous concerns for our personal health and safety, and now use that as their justification for visiting restrictions is hypocrisy- period! It pisses (me) off!</br></br>

While many examples have been presented to jail officials regarding ways to safely open visits, or how other correctional institutions have opened visitings, here, they’ve gone simply ignored. It’s frustrating, then it just turns into anger. To know our loved ones are so close and want to come, but can’t. So that's that.</br></br>

I almost forgot to mention while I caught corona virus and was on quarantine I had an accident in my cell and broke my pinky finger. I notified medical staff immediately, but received an ice pack… and yes you guessed it. Drink lots of water!</br></br>

No pain medication even after such an obvious fracture of my pinky turned the other way, swollen fat. It made no difference. They said I had to wait for an x-ray, just because they refused to send me out on an emergency care run. To make a very long story short, to an already long story, I was finally sent out on an emergency care run, a month later!</br></br>

Even my surgeon at UC Irvine at orange asked why I took so long to see him? All the while I was in pain and certainly hydrated from all the water I drank in hopes that perhaps they’d be right and water takes away pain. It didn’t. I had surgery about a month and a half later, and now have permanent damage to my finger cause they took so long.</br></br>

I’m COVID-19 free now, I took the vaccine. Yes of course, Johnson and Johnson. No blood clots thankfully. I’m headstrong and genuinely happy and positive focused. So despite all of this I know there's plenty of things to look forward to, smile and be happy for.</br></br>

I try to be optimistic about life. I know that even while in here there are millions of other people who don’t have the things I’m fortunate enough to have, even in here. So I’m grateful and appreciate my blessings, and continue to keep myself focused on things that will help me later on in life.</br></br>

It’s unfortunate knowing there’s a vast majority behind bars who aren’t so positive or mentally headstrong. I can see how quick they can deteriorate mentally.</br></br>

I hope my experience can be shared in a positive way. If I can help with any other questions any one may have about anything, I’ll be more than happy to answer it as best as I can. I don’t mind if my name is added to whom ever it is shared with, or posted on. Thank you all for caring enough to even be inquiring. It means alot. Take care, stay safe, and God bless!
