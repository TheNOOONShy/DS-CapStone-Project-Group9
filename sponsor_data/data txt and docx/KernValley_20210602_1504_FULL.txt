This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Kern Valley State Prison.</br></br>

Hey [redacted] how you doing? In response to your letter, I was curious to know what exactly kind of story you were trying to get? Personal experiences I’ve went through in here or the issues inside prison? Because there are a lot of overlooked health and safety issues here where I’m currently housed “Delano, CA.” I am currently housed in administrative segregation due to being a victim of an attempted murder.</br></br>

I did have an idea about a piece I wanted to write about called “Who is out there?” The system is a strange place, a lot goes on behind these walls. I am interested in speaking with you. I have a lot of stories and experiences I’ve been through behind these walls. I did get your phone number. So look, we get one call per week (Saturday-Sunday) around 10 AM. I would like to set something up with you. If a phone appointment don’t work out you could write back, and we could set up visitation?</br></br>

Two understanding journalists are allowed to come visit at any time, outside of visiting hours correct me if I’m wrong? Thank you for taking the time on this piece, you could help me shed some light on my case? I’m currently incarcerated for a crime I did not commit. The victim in my case told the District Attorney and Judge I’m not the perpetrator and was high on meth during the time of the incident. If that’s not your area of work and you are strictly on journalism stories, maybe you can point me in the right direction?</br></br>

This address I’m writing you, is this your place of work? Do you have another address to write to? The phone number you gave me in the letter, do I just ask about you? However you wanna do this lets get started. I got nothing but time.</br></br>

Take care of yourself and be safe.
