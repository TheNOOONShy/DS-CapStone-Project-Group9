This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Pleasant Valley.</br></br>First off, I would like to thank you and your team for the support. This year has been very difficult and we have been met with many obstacles. Most of our education programs and self help groups have come to a halt. We only go out to yard two times out of the week now.</br></br> 

I am coping with this crisis pretty well. Even though we no longer get visits, we can still write each other. It comforts me to know my family is staying safe out there and taking precaution.</br></br>I wear a mask and maintain social distancing so I feel my safety is good. However the correctional officers continue to search our cells and don't change gloves in the process. The CO enforce the mask policy but don't take in consideration they are only ones that can bring it in here and spread it by going into our cells.</br></br> 

It is also very hard to get knocked off because no self help groups are available and the college only accepted a limited amount of people.</br></br> I've been participating in outside groups and continue to search for programs out there that may help me get enrolled into college classes or self help groups. We are all simply trying to make the best of what we have and what we can get. Thank you for your time and hopefully you get what you're seeking.</br></br> 

Best wishes to you all as well.
