This letter was written by a person incarcerated at San Quentin.</br></br>

Some may say how do I cope with life while incarcerated? All I can say is that its never easy being confined like a wild beast when I am a human being. These things are never easy to explain or deal with some days because extreme lengths of continued incarceration is unnatural and sometimes cruel and unusual.</br></br>
 
Just being incarcerated and crammed in a small cell with another person with the energy, attitude, mental health status and stress of being locked away is a struggle in itself. Now, considering the social distancing order issued by our government is impossible to adhere to and our institutions are in violation of these orders and continue to resist lowering the prison population pursuant to previous mandated court orders and many laws allowing the prison system to act on its own by applying earned credit towards release, sentence recalls, the early release of youth offenders and elderly prisoners who have served specific terms even the parole board has the authority to do the same but the prison population is still overwhelming, I would ask why?</br></br>
 
Isolation can easily be a failure to act towards a individual or a population of people. Please donâ€™t let our prison systems resemble a storm like Katrina in the eye of COVID-19. Incarceration and Isolation, when will these things change?
