Some inmates that tested positive moved and others refused to move and left among us. Because they didn’t enforce the “who test positive or have symptoms must move to the quarantine building to lower the spread and contact.”</br></br>

One day in September 2020, I start having symptoms. I wouldn’t complete my workouts because I would get exhausted quickly, crazy headaches, and unusually tired. I’d just want to sleep. They escorted me from medical to the quarantine building where I was put into a cell.</br></br> 

Later, my TV and property came.</br></br>

While in quarantine, the only time we seen staff or medical staff was when they brought our breakfast and dinner. And when the medical staff did our vital checks twice a day. So if anyone was having a medical emergency the only way to get staff’s attention was seven in the morning at breakfast, or four in the afternoon during dinner because they don’t come check on us. We’re really isolated from them.</br></br>

After quarantine, back to normal stuff. They didn’t test no one for COVID-19 for several weeks, no quarantine or new cases. So people stop wearing masks and all that safety stuff went out the window. The inmates who caught the virus all had different experiences.</br></br> 

Some didn’t feel a thing while others said they would run out of breath if they did too much movements.</br></br>

These people don’t give a shit about anyone’s health. I’m talking about both the inmates and staff. You got staff walking around maskless, even medical staff that pass out medication in all the buildings. They’re the ones we come in contact with daily.</br></br> 

So it’s obvious they’re the ones who introduced the virus to the inmate population. Some staff do follow the rules and wear masks and gloves when dealing with us.</br></br> 

For the inmates, some just don’t care because the virus didn’t cause them discomfort or sickness. So they don’t wear a mask or they think they won’t catch it again. Some inmates start having symptoms and refuse the test so they won’t go on quarantine and they continue talking to others and spreading the virus.
