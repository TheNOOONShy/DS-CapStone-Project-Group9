Dear UCI students, life is unreal! You guys at the prison pandemic project cannot fathom how exhilarated I am because of your letter! actually it may be kind of pathetic but we'll get to why I was so affected by your inquiry later. My name is (redacted) and I'm 41 years old.  There is a black and white photo of me enclosed in this letter.  Originally from northern New Jersey, just across the Hudson River from New York City I came out to Southern California 1997 to attend college in San Diego. Serious issues coupled with the stressors involved with being a working college student and alcohol abuse, led me to a string of robberies. 
<br><br> 
I paroled in September 2001 after serving three years of a five-year term with more issues than I had upon entering an unforgiving and harming prison system. The same set of triggers and deplorable prison gang associations caused me to make a series of monumental mistakes! Another robbery on federal district attorneys in LA and misuse laws landed me behind walls for 33 years on a non violent robbery which carried to 24-26 your terms depending on the previous 20. I've now dissolved my ties with these prison gangs and have had to survive alone in a brutal environment. Violent incidents, victimisation, homelessness and abysmal predicaments came and went. I've hurt some of the cretans, predators and bullies sent to target me in the past subsequently causing my sentence to be extended by 16 more years. In 2016 the CDC placed the r on the end of Rehabilitation and Rehabilitation began for me for my first time in a level 4 yard Max security.
<br><br> 
 I found stability and have been involved in numerous self-help courses chosen to cope with challenges responsibly and address those serious issues that have plagued me since adolescence. The CDCR acknowledged my progress by transferring me to a prison with plenty of rehabilitative programs. Working in a sewing factory, participating in self-help groups and finally going to college (it only took 23 years to make it to class). This is the scenario that I was in last March when COVID came calling.  We made it through 9 months without an active case on our yard. The news kept me both informed and anxious, while the world rapidly reacted to this uniquely treacherous virus. Our activities and movements were sustained systematically, we wore masks and were never outside by ourselves and we waited. Other prisons like San Quentin were disaster areas and staff scoffed at the precautionary rules such as mandatory masks. There were a ton of close calls, we were placed on lockdown, tested with long torturous Q-tips up our noses but released when all was clear.
<br><br> 
Then on November 22nd we were recalled for more critical work assignments, important jobs which are never canceled and the rumors and trepidation spread. Our prison commissary supervisor was taken out of the prison infected with COVID! The entire prison was locked down and everyone was tested. We were kept in the dark, staff played the situation up yet again to adhere to all the precautions! We spent the next four months being tested every 4 days and watching guys who are positive get taken away to quarantine areas. At first, it was something of a jokeâ€¦ then, it became scary because people came down with the symptoms such as loss of taste, headaches and etc. this came with more tests, name is being called over and over on a PA system, guys leaving it was like Schindler's list! 
<br><br> 
People refusing the test to avoid being carried away to some unknown and horrible area of the infected patients! Paranoia set in, convicts stayed in their cells and were afraid to use the internet at all; some used used humor and it insisted it was the government or China that started the virus others made sense of the facts and hunker down in place planned on riding it out in their cells, and not in gymnasiums like the zombie movies!
<br><br> 
Throughout November to March of 21 we were kept on lockdown and not giving much info. Many guys returned from quarantine areas with outrageous stories of no medical assistance  just warehouses of bodies. Others said they had become extremely weak, sick and fearful. A few never returned out of my co-workers whom I helped pack to go to the quarantine. They died of COVID. In retrospect, CDCR didn't prevent us from getting exposed; they simply managed the rate at which we became infected in order to prevent their medical staff from being overwhelmed. 
<br><br> 
By February/March 21 most of us were exposed or infected and the population reached herd immunity next, everyone was given vaccines.  Now our programs, activities and movement are solely returning. I became sick for 10 days in early February and stayed in the comfort of my familiar cell. There were days when I was fearful about my loss of appetite, smell, taste which lasted close to two weeks. Being sequestered helped my ability to stay calm though really. 
<br><br> 
The build-up was way worse than the sickness and the vaccine side effects were substantial. Moving forward throughout the pandemic guys are also experiencing respiratory problems.. I have little support and no visitors, so COVID hasn't impacted me on that front. This is the true reason I'm ecstatic about your correspondence. To be frank I'm a decent, kind, nurturing and dynamic man. It is sad that I've been denied friends, affection and companionship for so long. Yeah I screwed up a ton and committed robberies but I take responsibility for it but decades and prisons also just seems unjust.  I'm not seeking legal  help. What I am doing with this unplanned opportunity is asking for a cherished chance to converse with an interesting woman. Thank you for listening, think how crazy it would be if we met randomly and connected, prison pandemic team!
