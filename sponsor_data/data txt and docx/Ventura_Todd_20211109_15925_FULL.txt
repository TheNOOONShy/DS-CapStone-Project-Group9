This story was told by a person incarcerated at Todd Road Jail.</br></br>UCI: What has the COVID situation been like at your facility?</br></br>Caller: Yeah, that's what I wanted to rephrase. It's been moderate as far as I know. Not - not too many cases and not too serious.</br></br>UCI: Okay. Do you feel like they have been taking appropriate measures when there are cases?</br></br>Caller: Yeah actually, I have. I feel they have been following through on - on certain procedures.</br></br>UCI: Okay, awesome. How has the vaccination situation been like at your facility?</br></br>Caller: Last [unintelligible], but like I said, you know, they handle it properly.</br></br>UCI: Okay. What has it been like for you to have reduced visitation and programming?</br></br>Caller: It's been helpful actually.</br></br>UCI: You said helpful? Can you elaborate a little bit on that?</br></br>Caller: Hello?</br></br>UCI: Hello? Can you hear me?</br></br>Caller: Yes. Hello?</br></br>UCI: Oh, I can hear you now.</br></br>Caller: Okay.</br></br>UCI: I'm actually -</br></br> Caller: You want me to answer that question?</br></br>UCI: Oh yeah. Yes, please, sorry.</br></br>Caller: Okay, well I was saying I don't get visitations, but I do - I do see that they're there. They do or - are helpful, but that's, that's just from what I know. And oh, I get - I get told to wear mask when - occasionally, you know, when I'm told to.</br></br>UCI: Okay, and then what about - what has it been like for you to have reduced programming?</br></br>Caller: Man, reduced programming, it - I mean it all depends, but it is - it is what it is.</br></br>UCI: I see. How have you been coping with the crisis?</br></br>Caller: I usually ask people, you know, or if they're, if they're in line to get anybody infected or have been exposed to COVID-19, and that's - that's it mainly.</br></br>UCI: Okay. I know you said you don't have any visitors, but how has the COVID situation affected your loved ones?</br></br>Caller: On - [unintelligible] apart, I'm not allowed to see my people or my family, and that is - that is part of the reason why, and I really don't blame them for, for being like that.</br></br>UCI: Okay. What would have made the situation at your facility better?</br></br>Caller: If we were let outside more often, hopefully. It's not my job. Yeah, I'm just here to be in, you know, there are certain guidelines that we all go in, you know? I guess.</br></br>UCI: Yeah. What else do you want people to know about your experience?</br></br>Caller: I want people to know, okay, to want to better themselves and, it's okay, you know, to find those resources that you need, that are there, you know? 24/7, you know? And they're out there, and you should go get them. You know?</br></br>UCI: Yeah, I hear you. That's all of my questions for today. Did you have any questions for - about the program, or did you want to add anything else to your story?</br></br>Caller: I think all my questions were answered in the beginning of this evaluation, you could say.</br></br>UCI: Okay, awesome.</br></br>Caller: Yeah.</br></br>UCI: Then that is all for today. If you ever have anything else you want to share, you're welcome to call again, or we also accept letters and artwork if you wanted to send anything in.</br></br>Caller: Okay. Super.</br></br>UCI: Awesome. Thank you so much. Have a good night. Bye-bye.
