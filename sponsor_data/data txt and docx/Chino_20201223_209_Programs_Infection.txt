Personally we are more down and out because of it. Especially the lucky ones who did get visits. No visits! They just started video computer visits in special area.</br></br> 

I’ve heard there’s approximately eight to 10 computers locked up for this.</br></br>

For religious inmates, they are not getting services, and I’m sure that affects them. Just being in cell extra hours now affects our mental state. Especially not being able to go to main exercise yard as much now. Who knows when we’ll get our regular program back.</br></br>

First we need to get vaccinated. Even after that I hear we must still wear a mask. Until we lose the masks, we’ll stay on this “not so good” program.</br></br>

Also some inmates, my cellie being one, say they’re not going to get the vaccine shot. So I don’t know how CDCR will handle that situation. No solid word yet if they’re going to make shots mandatory or not.</br></br> 

We shall see. I will take the shot most likely.
