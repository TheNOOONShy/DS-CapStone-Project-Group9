They’re profiting from these calls right now.</br></br>UCI: Mhmm.</br></br>Caller: I had to call you collect. You know. This is a world pandemic, and they’re profiting. We can’t call our families to check to see, I have a 75-year-old mother. I can’t call her because she’s definitely afraid of to put her credit card with the GTL. And, you know, you have a lot of men that are like that here. Their family members are old, and they’re you know, they're living on a fixed income. So they’re profiting off of the fact that we’re incarcerated, going through this. And this is a pandemic.</br></br>UCI: Mhmm.</br></br>Caller: And they’re, they’re just not, they’re not being sensitive or compassionate to what we’re going through.
