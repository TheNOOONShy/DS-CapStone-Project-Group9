PrisonPandemic,</br></br>

This will be my second letter forwarded to PrisonPandemic about the way we are being treated at High Desert State Prison. In this second missive, I just want to highlight how less than human we are being treated. And this also helps with venting frustrations on paper of our current treatment.</br></br>

Instead of in a negative way that wouldn't solve anything. To fully understand what we are dealing with right now, I must give you the whole narrative.</br></br>

Things tend to happen in prison that is out of anyone's control. Play yard that I am honest currently on lockdown due to a recent incident. We are still currently dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic worldwide. We are on lockdown for 10 to 14 days while the administration figures out and handles the situation.</br></br>

While on lockdown we are showered once every other day. One tier at a time, ten cells, each tier, two individuals in each cell. So 20 men each day, per two showers are supposed to be cleaned on second watch. Between 8 a.m. and 1:30 p.m., also, on third watch 2 p.m. through 9 p.m.</br></br> 

The whole ten days on lockdown, our showers were never cleaned.</br></br>

Now on top of all of that, while we are being fed by the correctional officers in our buildings when they pass out our food. Some tend to drop food and or trays in front, or around our cells, leaving the food there for days.</br></br> 

Some of the food actually stay on the floor or tiers for the whole 10-day lockdown. Which is very nasty, unsafe, and unsanitary to have to live around.</br></br>

When we asked to have our showers and living areas cleaned due to the COVID pandemic, and just being a decent and clean human being, we were told it won't hurt anyone, or we were ignored all together. Like our livelihood meant nothing to them. We are being treated like livestock caged animals.</br></br>

I hope that this brief missive can and will shine some light on the hardships we deal with on a day-to-day basis. Especially during this COVID-19 pandemic.</br></br> 

I close for now, and I thank you for your time and this opportunity to have a voice when it's desperately needed. Thank you!</br></br>

With passion for perfection, survival, and action.
