This story was told by a person incarcerated at Solano.</br></br>

Caller: Ventilation of filtration systems are filthy. I'm looking at right now at the, the ventilation system and there’s no drop sealing. So we’re exposed to the roof, so I’m looking at an inch of dust. Literally an inch of dust inside the ventilation system, on top of the ventilation system, and on the air ducts.</br></br> 

And then on the beams, there’s monocoat on the beams and the monocoat is just filthy with dust built up on it. And some of it, like I said is, you know, its leaking here in the gym.</br></br>UCI: Mhmm.</br></br>Caller: It’s been removed, and the beams are showing, and they’re rusted. And there’s rust roll- there's rust, dripping down the wall and it’s just terrible. It just looks filthy. But the issue is they’re not changing the filters -</br></br>UCI: Mhmm.</br></br>Caller: - in the actual ventilation system. So we’re breathing particulates, we’re breathing dust. It’s causing lung infections, and it’s just, it’s just terrible. It’s horrible.
