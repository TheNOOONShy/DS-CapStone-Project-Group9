This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Soledad. </br></br>

This is the worst place for COVID-19. Those cells have no air. all you have is your window. How can you be six feet distanced with a cellie? I'm not saying let every inmate out of here, that would make me crazy. There are inmates in my situation. I was found suitable by a parole board in October 2020. I tested positive in November 2020.</br></br>

I am a three-striker. I don't have a murder, so why am I still here? When you have 810 inmates positive, 80 staff positive. However, CDCR wants to hold on to non-violent inmates, what happens to prop 57?
