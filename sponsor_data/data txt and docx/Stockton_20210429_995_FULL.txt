To the PrisonPandemic project. Hello, I would like to thank you for sending this letter and asking to be a part of this project to preserve information for the archives that will be collected. I will add what I can for such a request.</br></br>
As for me personally, I have been coping with this pandemic in a positive way. Due to the fact this institution has been strongly competent and effective in reducing the spread of COVID-19, during the height of its unknown impact and/or nature. CHCF, head of operations, (that is what I will call them), from the beginning had quickly stopped the interactions of inmates, going from one section to another.</br></br>
And by doing this was good because, if not the spread of COVID-19 would have been worse. Each building was isolated. Later on, there was inmates getting sick, but this was also dealt with with quick response. Yes, some inmates were affected by COVID-19, and my prayers goes out to their loved ones.</br></br>
As the days and months pass on, all the inmates who were not infected by COVID-19 were offered a chance to get vaccinated (a quick guess, I would say two out of a hundred inmates opt not to take the test). I felt very safe after getting both shots. I would also like to add that I appreciate the medical staff and out of state volunteers, the captain(s), lieutenants(s), assistant warden(s), warden, and all other staff members who work tirelessly in keeping everyone safe.</br></br>
Also, the inmates who worked 10 to 12 hours daily to keep the kitchen working to provide proper meals, Now, as to not seeing my family it was not hard because we all had to adapt to what was taking place. But I will add that the free phone calls that was provided by the phone company was a great help to all of us inmates and for our family members as well. It had helped to reduce stress.</br></br>
I was blessed not to have lost any family members, but my heart goes out to everyone who has suffered such a loss of a loved one, friend, or family members. Now, there were a few things that had taken place, but we had to adapt to such. It was done for our safety. For the most part, we kept cleaning, washing our hands, stayed six feet apart and wore our masks, to stop any germs.</br></br>
And being tested every other week was also very helpful. Yes, it all seemed a bit much, but it was needed. As for the emotional impact towards the inmates, we stayed in prayer and came together within guideline rules by reading the Bible.</br></br>
And those inmates who did not come together with us, we checked on them making sure they were ok and if they needed anything. I saw inmates come together in a whole different way, showing a humanity love for each other. When I saw a person needing emotional advice, I was there to help them.</br></br>
It is what I have a talent for. I sometimes joke and say ÓDoctor Phil went to school for what he does, and do it well, but I was blessed to do what I do, and blessed with it.Ó Well, I added what I could, and I hope this information can be shared and added to your archives. I thank you once again.</br></br>
