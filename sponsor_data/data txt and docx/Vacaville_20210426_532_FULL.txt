This story was told by someone incarcerated at Vacaville.</br></br>

UCI: So, how are you today?</br></br>

Caller: I'm very blessed. How are you?</br></br>

UCI: I'm good, that's good to hear. So which facility are you currently housed at?</br></br>

Caller: I'm calling from California Medical Facility in Vacaville, California.</br></br>

UCI: Okay, and what has the COVID situation been like at your facility?</br></br>

Caller: What's that?</br></br>

UCI: What has the COVID situation been like at your facility?</br></br>

Caller: I didn't hear that, say that one more time?</br></br>

UCI: What has the COVID situation been like at your facility?</br></br>

Caller: Oh, it’s been, it's been ups and downs but mostly they got it under control. Like about, I don't know, six months ago it was really bad. People were dying and stuff. They were quarantining a lot of people. But after that it got pretty good.</br></br>

It's like, it's pretty, it's pretty laid back now. You mean, it's not real, it's not real restrictive now, you know. It's kind of well, we gotta stay 6 feet apart and wash their hands and we still eat in our cells and stuff like that, and wear a mask.</br></br>

We've got to wear a mask and yeah, I mean. But if you, if you follow the rules and do what's right it works out pretty good, yeah.</br></br>

UCI: Okay, you say you guys eating your cell how does that work?</br></br>

Caller: They just bring when they, they, they bring the meal to our room and they deliver them.</br></br>

UCI: Okay.</br></br>

Caller: Like having room service. It's like room service. You gotta make the best of it you know.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah I understand so-</br></br>

Caller: Anytime-</br></br>

UCI: I'm sorry, go ahead.</br></br>

Caller: Oh, anytime you go to the chow hall where there’s like a couple hundred.</br></br>

UCI: Mhm.</br></br>

Caller: That’s where I get this stuff like, like bread and stuff like that. But they've been testing us a lot here, you mean, I already got both of my shots.</br></br>

UCI: Okay.</br></br>

Caller: I got both of my Moderna, the Moderna.</br></br>

UCI: Yes.</br></br>

Caller:  Yeah, we yeah. I think this because this is a medical facility so there's a lot of high risk people and stuff like that. So, they came and they gave most, mostly all of us our one and two shots.</br></br>

UCI: Okay.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, I’ll be quiet and let the, let you ask questions and I will answer them.</br></br>

UCI:  No, you're fine, that was my next question. I was just going to ask like, how has the vaccination situation being since people have been getting vaccinated now. So I just wanted you to like elaborate on that, and you know?</br></br>

Caller: No, they gave it. Yeah, it's it's it's, they come, they come around. They give us all the shots because like I said, this is a medical facility and, and people have a lot of weak immune systems and, cancer. And you mean, all different diseases and stuff like that. You know, they give it to you too. I guess pro- prolong your life.</br></br>

UCI: Mhm, okay and so how have you been coping with the crisis of COVID-19?</br></br>

Caller: I, well I’ve been doing pretty good, you mean, in just making the best of it. It’s just been, you mean, washing my hands, wearing my gloves, and wear, using universal precautions.</br></br>

And, and, just I worked down in the, I work down in the emergency room where they bring people down there and then that's a high risk area where you meet people. They bring people they think have it and they, then they quarantine them in another area.</br></br>

Even if you get exposed to the, say if somebody comes in there and they have it, or a staff member comes in and they and they were infected with it. Then they quarantine us for 14 days in another part of the prison and stuff like that.</br></br>

That happened to me one time they quarantined me, but I was in there from, I was quarantined for like I mean, I, I guess about a month. You know what I mean?</br></br>

UCI: Mhm, and how has the COVID situation at your facility affected your loved ones?</br></br>

Caller: Oh, well I called my mom. I called my mom and my sister. I just called him yesterday and they're doing good. They don't, my mom don't want to take, my mom don't want to take this shot, you what I mean?</br></br>

UCI: Mhm.</br></br>

Caller: I mean, uh, I think my sister already took this shot, but they're doing good. Thank you for asking about them, you know.</br></br>

UCI: No problem.</br></br>

Caller: Thank you very much.</br></br>

UCI: And so what has it been like for you to have reduced visitation and like programming?</br></br>

Caller: Oh, they got it. They got for a while. They just had it. They gave us free phone calls on the, the, the, the, the people who run these phone, people. They gave us free phone calls for once a month but if your family have money they're able to put money on their phone and you call them.</br></br>

And, but now they, they opened up the visiting where your visitor got to get here an hour before, so they could take the, take the tests. And if they're negative, they can come in and visit. But they also got the, the, the Skype visiting where you can go down there and you can visit on Skype to your family for half hour.</br></br>

UCI: OK, that's good, that's good.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, it's real good. Yeah, it's real good. Yeah the, the prison here is real good.</br></br>

UCI: Okay.</br></br>

Caller: Good care of us, you know what I mean, but a lot of my friends have died.</br></br>

UCI: Ah, I'm sorry to hear that.</br></br>

Caller: Oh, that's okay, you know what I mean.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: Here today gone tomorrow. Just gotta make the best of it, you mean?</br></br>

UCI: Right.</br></br>

Caller: The best thing about the future, it only comes one day at a time.</br></br>

UCI: Definitely.</br></br>

Caller: Just gotta be ready for today. You just gotta make the best of today, you know?</br></br>

UCI: Yes. That's so true.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah.</br></br>

UCI: What else did you want the people to know about your experience?</br></br>

UCI: Well it's just, I guess it's what you make it, you know? If you choose to be a sad doggie, go be a sad dog or you could be a happy dog, you could be, you mean? Life is what you make it. And I just choose to make my life the best I can and try to put my best foot forward.</br></br>

And you know, just, in the same day, I, the same, I been here for about 30 years, the same day that I took my corona shot I went in front of the parole board, half hour later I went in front of the parole board, and the parole boarder’s on Skype. They got the Commissioner and Deputy Commissioner, and they found me suitable to go home.</br></br>

So I'm very blessed so I didn't have no side effects of the, people say you have like the soreness and this, I didn’t have no soreness or anything like that, but it all worked out good.</br></br>

UCI: That's good.</br></br>

Caller: The parole board, it all worked out.</br></br>

UCI: That's it's so great to hear. Well, that's currently all for me today and I thank you very much for participating in the PrisonPandemic. Please consider telling your friends about us and seeing if they would like to call in.</br></br>

Caller: OK, I will do that. Okay, can I call in again one day again?</br></br>

UCI: Oh, yes you can.</br></br>

Caller: Oh, good, thank you so much. Thank you so much.</br></br>

UCI: You have a good night.</br></br>

Caller: I'm happy prisoner. I'm a happy prisoner. Okay, thank you.</br></br>

UCI: Thank you.</br></br>

Caller: Bye bye.
