To PrisonPandemic</br></br>


To whoever has an ear to hear a open heart and the sensibility to believe the truth when it is offered to them. I am a writer of words, these words are sometimes colored with metaphors so I may hold your attention.</br></br>


This thing that has happened to the world, this darkness that gripped so many innocents, may God continue to bless all those in pain and bring some stability to their lives.</br></br>


Being an inmate, going on 25 years, this COVID-19 couldn’t have come at the worst possible time. Just when my approval for visitings my [redacted], was approved they stopped all contact visits. I can’t began to tell how devastating this has been.</br></br>


And because there has been no gym or yard for such a long time, a lot of us older guys in our 50’s, haven’t gotten enough exercise to sustain us. In Jan. 2020 I get really sick, contractions so bad it felt like I had under gone a zillion situps. So sore from coughing.</br></br>


COVID-19 was just announced, but I thought it was just the people in the city of Corona. Go figure how dumb I felt to know it was much bigger than that. So a few of my cellies got sick in Jan. and Feb. 2020. But they didn’t test us or quarantine us.</br></br>


We just suffer and thank you Jesus we recovered. The months follow it be evident the whole world was in trouble. I’m located in Ione, CA in a place call MCIC Mule Creek inFill Center. It’s basically up the hill from the regular prison.</br></br>


Fairly new. Built to house level II inmates in dorm setting - six men per room. 2 double beds and two single bed (called cadillac beds) upper and lower tiers. 4 pods per building, and (twin facilities) four buildings ea.</br></br>


We are still cell feeding, and the food is often cold, never very gratifying. Anyways, the lower yards in MCSP were hit hard with COVID. It eventually found its way up here and it just leveled us. Nov. 2020 to Feb. 2020 almost everyone on the yard got sick.</br></br>


One of the things that shook us up like a shaker, was that they started moving us around to other buildings. Per [redacted] 104 people moved from block to block to accommodate all the PIA workers (Prison Industry Association). So forget what moving people around would do, they clearly were not (custody) thinking of our health.</br></br>


Then they started moving people from C and B yard to our yard with no explanation. And then came the problem of being quarantined for two weeks, and bouncing you around from yard to yard, gym to gym. Packing us in double bunks while we were sick, and infected. There was no isolation, and when your two weeks were finally up they placed you somewhere a bed was open.</br></br>


So there you, with all property in boxes, into cells with those who had not been infected. That’s until the COVID all over your stuff and clothes got your new cellies sick. Then the protesters came out, refusing to test, because they didn’t want to go through all the hell stories they were being told by all the resolved inmates.</br></br>


Mind you, everyone in my cell (Jan. 2021) were all coughing, running noses - we had it but we were refusing to test. Finally they promised to hold our beds so we tested positive. I really didn’t think my name would be called, because my symptoms were gone. But I did test positive Jan. 25.</br></br>


They put us all in a gym (double bunk). I agree to received the drip treatment. Donald Trump treatment, they called it.</br></br>


Today is Friday April 23rd, still haven’t had my first vaccine, but was told soon. So we’ll see… to be honest with you I don’t really believe I tested positive for SARS. The reason I say this is because I didn’t even swab me nose for mucus, and gave it back to them without them knowing.</br></br>


So when they did call my name along with 3 other roommates, I just shook my head because I know some shenanigans was going on… The next few weeks in the gym went by uneventfully. Kind of reminded me of high school when we all took showers together.</br></br>


My girl lives in Riverside, I’m from LA, so in December (2020) I asked to be transfered, they denied me cause I wasn’t COVID resolved, and Chino was only taking COVID resolved, so now I have to wait another year. The contact visits with a mask plus six feet apart and no kissing is not a visit that she is going to want. And video visits is only a half hour.</br></br>


So PrisonPandemic, thanks for writing me, I hope my letter helped.</br></br>


I’m sending you a poem I recently wrote in April. I hope you like it. I also draw, but to get that would require a response. Take good care.</br></br>


Sincerely.</br></br>


Poem</br></br>


It was warm and it was nice, that warm hand, gently holding me, broken and alone. Realizing what I had done. Father, the Holy Spirit and the Son. All of the above, restores me back to life with the gift of love.</br></br>


You are the now, you are the present, you’re everything I feel. I’m here to tell you Jesus is real. And that everything you’ve heard is true… if you just give him a chance. I promise you, He’ll change your life and make it brand new.</br></br>


He wakes me every morning, and puts a smile upon my face, blesses me with a song in my mind, and showers me with His amazing grace. I feel as light as a feather, my thoughts as clear as water. All day we walk and talk, even during work and play. Never a loss for words or what to say, I’m just thankful for  his presence, each and every day.</br></br>


I speak of a freedom within, the forgiveness of sins, I’m nobody special and yet I’m his son. This gift is not just for me, it’s for everyone. My soul rejoices, in the water of His word, the way beautiful colors brighten your way. Just listen to what he has to say…</br></br>


His truth and trust will get you through each and everyday. It’s time to go, I’m sorry I cannot stay, the Lord is calling me home, blessed are the seeds we have sown. There is a mystery in the making just keep your eyes on Him and live by His word, and it will be given to you without the asking.</br></br>


Acknowledge Him in all that you do and your days will be bright as well as blue. Have faith in Him, His word is true…
