This story was told by a person incarcerated at Avenal.</br></br>

Caller: So, if I had to, if I had to have anyone get an idea of what it is like in here, well now that you guys have the COVID out there, that’s pretty much what it’s like in here, except you guys have just a bit more freedom than we do to come and go as you please. But, you know, they got us locked up in a big cage, you know, that we can’t go nowhere and do anything. So we have to take it upon ourselves to take the measures we can take to keep ourselves safe, hand-washing, you know when we get the chemicals we make sure we spray all the surfaces down.</br></br> 

But you know, it doesn’t help either that we have a bunch of dirtbags that just don’t care about anybody else, and don’t wanna wear the mask, they cough all over the place, they touch stuff, they don’t use, they don’t clean their hands when they use the bathroom, you know just little stuff like that.</br></br>

There is people like that in here too, just because they are out there, they're dirtbags and they don’t care. So upon everything else you gotta deal with, you gotta deal with those type of people. So it’s just an accumulation of a lot of stuff happening, but you know we’re making do, we’re surviving, and we’re doing the best we can so, for me now personally, when I caught the COVID, I didn’t get it as bad as I thought it was gonna be. I had a lot of a throat issues, mucus, I had a hard time breathing for a little bit.</br></br>

I did have a slight fever. I was very lethargic. I was very tired all the time for like the first two weeks.
