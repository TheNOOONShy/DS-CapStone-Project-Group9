Dear PrisonPandemic,</br></br>


To whom this may concern:</br></br>


The life behind bar at this time of the pandemic global tel link is giving us two calls a piece
a month but as for the facility we are going through a lot. They are treating us like we are the ones who have it. They don’t understand they are the ones who leaves every day and go home and go out into the free world.</br></br>


They are the ones who can give it to us. I have had family members who has had more than once. They think that people are the only ones that can get it. We also have dogs here as well so there are deer wild turkeys and raccoons all over the place.</br></br>


The food they feed us is the same over and over the meat is not real. They feed us fake eggs old milk spoiled most of the time. They want us to take showers with see through curtains.</br></br> 


If you don’t go to breakfast you don’t get a lunch that is the way all the prison. Prison is overrated they want a lot out of you to give you so little to work with.</br></br>


You have to understand a lot women and men have been on drugs for a long time. It's hard for them to remember so when they have to take test or anything that require to use their brains it’s hard. I think they should sell pills for the mind.</br></br> 


So here at F.N.F teh women has never had a case here but we have had false positive cases. We don’t have the right medical staff here to help us if we was to have any kind of cases.</br></br> 


Even though we are in sac they no real money in this place, there is mole everywhere this place they have people with breathing problems. They are getting sick left and right it has nothing to do with COVID-19 and I think at the end of 19 going into 20 we did have COVID here before they know about it. So they give us hand sanitizer with no alcohol in it.</br></br> 


They let a lot of non-violent people go but a lot of them caught all new cases. But they never gave the violent offender and chance and we have families and friends that has caught COVID. My brother has had it twice my sister once. They had my one year old on quarantine for 14 days and I have been stressed out wanting to be there to support my family.</br></br> 


But because I am here not because I can’t be there with them. But I am ok doing my time if they give us some time off. Another 12 weeks or 16 weeks can help some of us in this place.</br></br> 


I don’t have paper or stamps and envelopes to send you all the letters I can get for you and your program.</br></br>


Respectfully
