This story was told by a person incarcerated at Valley State.</br></br>


Hello. I am 43 years old and I have been incarcerated since I was 19 years old. I am writing this story to share my experience of testing positive for COVID-19, in prison. I will share how CDCR mishandled the whole COVID-19 and how they infected the whole prison population, by their negligence.</br></br>


March 2020, they locked down all prisons in the state of California. I was at Valley State Prison in Chowchilla, CA. It’s a level two prison and we live in 8 man dorms. The prison went on “Modified Program.” No self-help groups, no visits, no education, no college and no vacation.</br></br>


Two hours of dayroom and two hours of yard. One building goes to the yard, only for two hours, then the next building. Only one hallway at a time for dayroom. The officers and free-staff are coming to work everyday and going home. I’m working in the kitchen so I was considered a “critical” worker, “essential” worker. They had me working seven days a week. I felt like a slave.</br></br>


The prison handed out no extra cleaning supplies, no bleach, and had no compassion for us as human beings. In a way, they started forcing us to test positive for COVID-19. At first, it was optional, then it went to, “if you don’t test, then you will be moved to quarantine.”</br></br>


I did what I had to do to prevent contracting COVID-19. CDCR did not do what they were required to do. They stacked each pod with eight people. Not only did they do that, but they mixed inmates that were negative. They housed those inmates together in the same room. The room I was in, they placed three inmates that had tested positive.</br></br>


These inmates were coughing and sneezing in the room. Before these inmates had showed up, I had tested about six times. Each time I tested negative. December 2020, I tested positive for COVID-19. I had all the symptoms and to this day, I still can’t smell 100%.</br></br>


December 11, 2020, they moved me from the room I was in to a Quarantine building. I couldn’t call my family or friends. I could not even tell them I caught COVID-19 and that I was OK. I couldn’t go to the canteen and I was cell-fed. It was a depressing time for me, and it was Christmas time.</br></br>


I strongly believe that because CDCR housed those three inmates in my pod, CDCR was the main reason I caught COVID-19. CDCR knew those men tested positive for COVID-19. Why did they move those inmates with others that were negative? Did CDCR deliberately put those inmates in my pod, so that I would contract the virus?</br></br>


I believe the CDCR gambled with my life. They had no idea how my body would react to the virus. I washed my hands, I wore a mask, I practiced social distancing. The one thing I had absolutely no control over, was those three inmates that were put in my room.</br></br>


Another thing I want to share about this pandemic is the inmate telephone system. There are eight telephones in the dayroom. Out of nowhere, CDCR decides to limit the phone usage. Allowing us to use only four phones during our two hours of dayroom. Each hallway has a total of 64 inmates. It only allows 32 of the 64 inmates to call home.</br></br>


Adding stress to that already existing stress from the pandemic. Now we can’t stay in touch with our loved ones, our friends and our support network. CDCR pushed us further from our family and friends. Their reason was so they can spray the phones down with “Cell block 64,” and let the chemicals sit for 15 minutes.</br></br>




Why of all places, did they choose to implement this procedure, on the telephones? Our only source and connection with home. It made no sense and it showed a lack of empathy and compassion on the CDCR’s behalf. No other place at the prison did they practice this procedure. The only place was our telephones.</br></br>


Today is April 2021 and I still get tested every week. I got my first vaccination shot last month. I’m waiting on my second shot. I owe all my health and positive mind-frame to my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. I am still alive and standing because of Him.College was another way I coped with this pandemic. Also, the book club I’m in helped me. Thank you for allowing me to share my experience and my opinions.</br></br>


Sincerely,
