This story was told by a person incarcerated at LA_MensCentral.</br></br>

UCI: And so, going further is that, you guys had reduced visitation and programming, and you know, how was that like?</br></br>

Caller: Oh, that sucks. I mean, you’ve gotta, my hat’s off to so many prisoners that got regular visits and regular family visits and stuff. And they’ve just for the last, basically, been going on two years with no visits from loved ones and it’s, it’s tremendously…</br></br>

I think that prisoners overall, in my level two facility, I don’t know. I’m not speaking for all levels of prison, but in my level two, I was very surprised that inmates were able to, to, I guess, handle it.</br></br>

And unfortunately, at my prison, they started, I don’t know a lot of people don’t realize this, but they started a program of, they give these inmates Suboxone and they give it to any inmate. And it’s also disheartening to me at the same time because there was such an influx of people getting, people that have never done heroin and stuff were getting basically free drugs, Suboxone.</br></br>

And so I hate to say it but it was so inundated, that I think that played a major part of people keeping their cool. They’re basically high on Suboxone, the majority of the people that [unintelligible]. But it, overall, I was surprised that people were able to maintain and to cope with the loss of the family visiting and visits in general.
