This story was told by a person incarcerated at Theo Lacy.</br></br>

And many of us, including myself, suffer from mental health issues. And, so being in a tiny cell the size of a parking space for 23-hours a day is overwhelming. Is really overwhelming and really, you know, if it wasn’t for organizations like the American Civil Liberties Union, Transforming Justice Orange County here in California, here in Orange County we wouldn’t have a voice. We wouldn’t be heard.</br></br>

But it’s really thanks to everybody who’s been advocating for us out there that we’ve seen a little bit of change. But not much.</br></br> 

I think everything the sheriff has done has been against his own will. So, just to see that it kind of, it makes you feel like you’re less than a human. Worse than even a second-class citizen. But, you know, I think that the sheriff has his agenda and believes that he needs to keep us behind bars because part of his agenda is to, you know, fill the beds.</br></br> 

It’s money and politics. But there’s real lives that are being affected by that. All his decisions are affecting real people.</br></br> 

And I have seen how devastating it’s been for family members, for people behind bars. I know that about a month ago someone committed suicide. The conditions in here are, you know, inhumane. I know that people with mental health issues are not being treated.</br></br>

Are not being treated properly. They’re not receiving the medical attention that they need or the mental health attention that they need.</br></br> 

So, it’s been tough but it’s also been enlightening. In many ways and it’s, like I said, it’s created connections and many of us have realized that we are oppressed by a system that doesn’t believe that we deserve second chances. But we are not suppressed. So, we still have a voice, even from behind bars and, you know, being able to use our voice to speak out against the living conditions behind bars and the terrible experiences that we’ve endured and suffered.</br></br>

It has created momentum in the battle and the fight to end mass incarceration and to replace it with a system that treats people with mental health, that treats people that have substance use issues and that deals with the social issues in our communities in a different way.</br></br>
