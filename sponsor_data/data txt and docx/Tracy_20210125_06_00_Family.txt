This story was told by a person incarcerated at Tracy.</br></br>
UCI: Hmmm. That’s- I really appreciate, you know, you sharing what’s going on, because that’s not something, you know, we’re hearing right now. With, you know, the prison system, where, you know, you’re having this very interesting time. Where your facility’s being shut down, and how that’s being handled. Like I guess the watering down of, you know, PPE, that’s kind of a big deal, especially right now.</br></br>
Is there anything you do to cope with being in your cell 24 hours a day? And then, you know, I know you say you filed grievances. And you also said those aren’t being, you know, heard, or they can take a very long time to get processed and to be acknowledged. So is there anything you do in the meantime to be able to cope? Are you able to call your family?</br></br>
Caller: Up until- I haven’t talked to my mom, my elderly mom, in over a month. I was supposed to talk- I was trying to call her today but she didn’t answer. I do a lot of praying. I do a lot of meditating on the word.</br></br>
I don’t do no- I’m not religious, but I am spiritual. I don’t believe in religion because religion is an attempt to reach God. And my spirituality is based upon my relationship with Christ Jesus, who I call on continuously, on a continuum, because that’s my only refuge.</br></br>
That’s my only source of comfort in a post-pandemic, it’s the times uncertain out there, so you can imagine how it is in here. I wanna- I was gonna write what I’m telling you and be a little more specific, because I think my story needs to be- I need to really get my voice, [redacted].
