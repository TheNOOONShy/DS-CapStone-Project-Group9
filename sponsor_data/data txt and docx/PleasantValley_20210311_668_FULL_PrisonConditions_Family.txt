This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Pleasant Valley.</br></br>Hey, I am currently housed at Pleasant Valley State Prison. I’ve been here since March 2020 when the pandemic shut down all the prison. It is my first time in prison, and it’s been through the COVID pandemic. I got arrested July 2018, and was in county till November 2019 which makes me at three years away from any contact with my family.</br></br>

Although I do talk to them, and write them, there has not been any physical contact like hugs or kisses.</br></br>I’ve had a rough start, but I have relied on God to give me the strength. The fact that the pandemic has affected the whole world is an eye opener for me because you always tend to do things ourselves. The pandemic has made us all work together, and help each other out by example.</br></br>

Like helping those in need with words or just being there for somebody. Just going to someone’s cell door, and asking if they’re OK.</br></br>I believe that the safety in prison has been better, and it is my first term so I don’t know much about how the regular program is. I have been in prison only for the pandemic not for regular program. It’s hard to not get visits because I have not been able to hug my grandma, and mom. Although what hurts the most is not being able to hug my daughter.</br></br>

The fact that when she was born through c-section, which I was mostly hugging and caring for her because my wife did not have the strength brings good memories. And now she is four years old, and we have conversations here and there, but the most important is that she is healthy.</br></br>I hope the pandemic will help people with the fact that for the world to continue peacefully we all got to work together. I believe that everything happens for a reason, and we have to always better ourselves. And look for ways to be better examples to others by being caring, loving, respectful, honest, and trustworthy.
