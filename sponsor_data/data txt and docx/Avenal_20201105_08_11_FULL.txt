This story was told by a person incarcerated at Avenal.</br></br>UCI: The first question I’m going to ask you is what facility are your currently housed at?</br></br>Caller: I’m at Avenal State Prison.</br></br>UCI: Okay. And what is the current COVID-19 situation at your facility?</br></br>Caller: We are currently within our building, we are in a pod situation or dorm situation. And they have emptied out one dorm, presently, because there was one person who tested positive.</br></br>So they sent that person to another yard at the prison. And the rest of the dorm, who did not test positive but was exposed, was sent to an alternate yard. That is the only case that we have currently.</br></br>UCI: And what do you think is going okay in regards of your facility situation? Like what do you think they're handling okay within the facility?</br></br>Caller: Well, at this point, they have done a better job of testing more frequently. All of us, within the building, that have not contracted the COVID virus are tested weekly now. And they have a much quicker response when somebody does test positive.</br></br>UCI: Interesting. Okay. And what is troubling or concerning to you, personally?</br></br>Caller: Well, really, it's the exposure. 80 percent of our- not only our building, here, but of the yard that I'm on, has tested positive. And there has been- up until the recent few weeks, there had been no action taken to separate us in any way from those that were positive.</br></br>When our first major outbreak hit within our yard, which was four or five months ago, yeah, there was no action taken to separate those of us who were negative. In my particular dorm, there were, there’s eight people in our dorm. And six of them had tested positive.</br></br>
And the two of us that did not, you know, there was nothing done. We were kept within that same dorm. And it was the same in every dorm within our building. There was no effort made to keep us separated.</br></br>It was just the, you know, kind of whoever's going to get it is going to get it. And that was it. You know, there have been several people that originally tested negative, you know, in the following couple weeks, ended up becoming positive because they were exposed to it.</br></br>There were very few of us that remained, like I said, out of our near 200 within our building, there are about 30, maybe 35 that continue to be negative.</br></br>UCI: Oh, wow. How was COVID-19 handled at your facility at the beginning of the outbreak?</br></br>
Caller: Okay. It was a cluster, basically. As things started, they started shifting people from building to building, trying to- they put all the people that they felt were at risk, originally, into one building that would be all the people that were 60 and above.</br></br>
They moved, actually, into my building, into six particular dorms. And that lasted for about two weeks. They were, you know, supposed to be isolated in there.</br></br>There was only going to be four people to a dorm. But, within a couple weeks, they realized that, you know, they couldn't do that in the building and still maintain the population.</br></br>
So they ended up throwing people, you know, in with the bunkies. And every one of those dorms, you know, was up to 80 people within the first few weeks. So their initial response– maybe, with good intention but very limited foresight, you know, they, you know, every building was at, you know, 80 percent capacity.</br></br>And there was no way that they were going to reduce the numbers in the dorm and still maintain, you know, what they considered social distancing within our dorm. Most of our dorms hold 10 or 12 people.</br></br>And their solution to have social distancing in the dorm was to reduce that to eight people to a dorm. So I mean we, you know- got to, you know, double bunk for maybe, three feet, either above or below someone else. And, you know, a foot or two away from the bunk next to us.</br></br>So it was very limited success, early on and for several months, actually, before they finally seemed to have a system that made at least a bit of sense in getting people out of the building, now that, when they're positive.</br></br>
UCI: Right. And is it being handled differently, do you think, now?</br></br>
Caller: Yes. Like I said, they're testing all the people that have been negative throughout this on a weekly basis now. And, if anybody does turn up positive, they are removing them from this yard and putting them in a building on another yard. Where, I assume, you know, is just strictly for people that have tested positive.</br></br>UCI: And, if possible, could you please tell me, tell us, month-by-month, how the situation has changed at your facility?</br></br>
Caller: Yes. In the very beginning, when we had the first few outbreaks on the yard, we have four buildings on our yard, and there were outbreaks in two of the buildings. And the only action to really separate people, at that point, was to stop the intermingling of buildings, at the dining hall and at yard. But there was no separation within the building itself.</br></br>They would say that a particular dorm was on quarantine but they were allowed to, you know, go out into the dayroom. And they may have had their meals delivered, but they came out to the dayroom at the table with other inmates. So there was no separation in keeping those infected away from those that, you know, had not been infected yet.</br></br>
As things progressed into, say, May, in that area, all four buildings on the yard were heavily infected. With at least 60 percent of the people testing positive when they tested the entire yard. And 60 to 70 percent tested positive at that point.</br></br>And they, again, made no moves, just everybody that was negative just stayed exactly where they were at, surrounded by those that were positive. And, as I said, more people that tested negative in that initial testing became sick.</br></br>
And, eventually, you know, the rates are up to over 80 percent of the population, here, on this yard, has, at one time or another, tested positive now. And there's only, I know, there's only approximately 30 people within our building.</br></br>And other buildings are at about the same numbers. So it's, you know, 80 to 85 percent, now, that have, you know, contracted the COVID virus.</br></br>
So it wasn't until right around the end of August that they started testing all of the negative people. You know, after that initial test in about May or so, there was nobody being tested at all, you know, and until it was around sometime in August, either the end of July or sometime in August, that they started testing the negatives on a weekly basis.</br></br>And so that's kind of where we stand now. When somebody does come up positive, they, you know, as I said, they move them off to another yard. And, also, their dorm mates are moved to a separate yard, where they are quarantined for two weeks. And then, you know, hopefully, at that point, they will come back and regain their positions in the dorm that they left.</br></br>UCI: Got it.</br></br>Caller: That’s kind of where we're at now.</br></br>UCI: What do you, personally, think would make the situation at your facility better?</br></br>Caller: Well, I think it's approaching about the best that it can be, given the circumstances, now that they are separating people as they do test positive.</br></br>The real problem lies in the testing of the staff that brings, you know, that brings the COVID into us. You know? We're isolated. The only way that we're going to catch anything is from, you know, catching it from an outside source.</br></br>
UCI: Right.</br></br>Caller: And their testing is very limited, as far as the staff.
