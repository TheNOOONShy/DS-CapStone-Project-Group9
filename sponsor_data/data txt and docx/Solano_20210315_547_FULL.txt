Dear PrisonPandemic,</br></br>
 
Greetings, I hope this letter finds you and your classmates happy, healthy, and hopeful. This letter is written in response to you asking for my story regarding what happened to me in prison during COVID-19 pandemic.</br></br>
 
To begin, I work in the prisons optical shop where we produce glasses for medical patients and state prison inmates. Throughout this entire pandemic PIA administrators did what they could to keep it running even during the time of the stay-at-home order called by Governor Newsom. It is clearly obvious that their desire for the mighty dollar trumped the health and safety of inmate workers. In spite of lingering effects of my recent traumatic experiences along with my debilitating pre-COVID medical conditions, I'm being forced to work.</br></br>
 
I'm being threatened by supervisory staff with receiving disciplinary actions should I fail to show up for work. This reflects how significant my health is to the business. Daily pressure is placed on us workers to wear N95 masks however staff had a care-free attitude about keeping their own masks on. It is well-known that the only way Solano prison inmates would get infected was by way of staff.</br></br>
 
Initially, I personally did not mind working during COVID because I believed I was helping fellow Californian be able to see. I did what I could to stay COVID-free; wore a mask, washed hands frequently, and stayed six feet apart when possible. Today, I don't feel comfortable or safe anymore.</br></br>
 
In the housing units, it can hold up to 256 inmates and typically we have approximately 210 inmates. Sometime around May of 2020, each building removed 12 double bunked beds (every bed is double-bunk) and the number of inmates remained 180-190. I mention this as we have been over-crowded at Solona prison since my arrival in spite of the federal three judge panels order to reduce all prison populations.</br></br>
 
It is physically impossible to socially distance. Having a bunkmate means our faces are only three feet apart separated only by a slat or sheetmetal which the top bunk man sleeps on. When he coughs, sneezes or drops something from the top bunk, it comes down onto the bottom bunk leading to eventual spread of infection. This certainly does not make me feel safe health-wise or protected in my bed area.</br></br>
 
Additionally, when we went to sit at a table in the dayroom to do schoolwork, write letters, or hobby, the metal tables are not sanitized regularly or when done, not properly. The same foes for our dining tables in the chow hall. While we been instructed to sit two to a table, socially distancing is not feasible due to overcrowding. When seated across from one another, we are only three feet apart, not six.</br></br>

The next table behind, in front of, and across from where I sit at puts that inmate only three feet away as well. Not a conducive environment for remaining COVID-free.</br></br>
 
There never has been a mandatory testing for- of staff to my knowledge and for those randomly selected, were done several weeks apart. Temperature readings was done on a semi-regular basis for staff but as I will speak about later, it does not actually register when someone is infected. The most often used information to determine if staff would be allowed onto prison arounds; be it free staff or correctional, was self-reporting. If a staff did not self-report feeling sick, it went unnoticed until long after they were allowed to enter prison grounds and infect prison inmates.</br></br> 

Furthermore, staff were allowed to work inside different buildings and medical staff too which mean they contaminated multiple buildings.</br></br>
 
Inmates at Solano prison were isolated and safe from COVID-19 so long as all transfers of inmates from prison to prison stopped and staff testing was held at a high standard. In both cases the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, Solano State Prison, and Solano health care staff failed miserably resulting in unnecessary loss of life and the deliberate infection of mass inmates.</br></br>
 
Sometime around October or November of 2020, Solano prison received several inmates from San Quentin and Folsom prisons. Those inmates were as medical staff put it, "resolved cases." Initially a directive was issued stating any inmate arriving at the institution shall be quarantined for 14 days and tested. However, when the bus from Folsom arrived, it contained inmates who contracted COVID while at Folsom, were isolated and eventually released back into general population.</br></br> 

And several who did not test positive but were sent here due to being high risk.</br></br>
 
Inmates were mixed and contaminated on that bus. This fact is made worse due to correctional transportation staff touched every inmate placing waist chains and leg chain. Furthermore, these same staff are touching the inmates lunches and stopped at gas station or delis to purchase gas and food. Without ever maintaining proper COVID cleaning regiments.</br></br> 

This cross contamination was detrimental to the health and welfare of every inmate and staff at Solano prison because it was short after that Solano prison received its first case of COVID-19.</br></br>
 
Inmates who test possible were sent directly into mainline while the remaining inmates were placed into quarantine. One such Folsom "resolved" inmate were placed on the bunk next to mine. I have to admit that I was very suspicious and fearful. I believed I was lied to by staff who were trying to minimize this persons threat to my health.</br></br> 

I was so scared that I slept with a cloth mask every night, something that is both dangerous and unhealthy.</br></br>
 
Our dorms typically had 10-12 inmates. It became a policy of medical staff, should any inmate in a dorm test positive or self-report flu-like symptoms, the entire dorm is taken and put in quarantine, tested. And possibly could returned in 14-21 days after having two negative tests. This policy is so draconian that inmates refused to self-report out of fear of isolation or quarantine punishment.</br></br> 

Either isolation or quarantine provide any treatment such as over-the-counter medicines, nor were the doctor visits allowed except for emergencies. Nurses took daily temperatures, pulse rate, and oxygen level reading from building to building using the same equipment which were never thoroughly cleaned.</br></br>
 
Buildings seven and nine were used as quarantine buildings while the gymnasiums were used for isolation. At no time were the cells, beds, mattress, toilet, dayroom, phones, or drinking fountains ever properly sterilized after each use. As COVID spread rampantly in Solano, nearly half of inmates ever housed in building seven or nine ultimately contracted COVID. They came as negative but left positive.</br></br>
 
During this pandemic, correctional staff continuously told inmates that medical was in charge of mass movements, an order mandated from Sacramento CDCR headquarters. This statement does not nor should it be acceptable to ignore the inmates pleas for help or to dismiss their responsibility for maltreatment and abuse they daily observed. Correctional staff have a responsibility to both inmates and the public to keep every inmate safe.</br></br>
 
There was a dissension in how things were running however no correctional staff attempt to stop the wrongs and their futile attempt to manipulate and redirect fault fell on heaf ears. They were equally culpable for allowing mass movements of inmates which infected the entire prison. To this day, there still exists a disconnecting and distrust toward correctional staff as a direct result.</br></br>
 
I personally swabble (COVID tested) multiple times and everyone been negative. The nurses conducting the swabbling were forceful and unapologetic. The testing was uncomfortable and they did not make it any better. As mentioned before, anytime a single person tested positive for COVID, the entire dorm was moved out and the testing reset.</br></br> 

At least once or twice a week, someone was testing positive so the buildings would ever come off quarantine until the entire building was moved out.</br></br>
 
On December 12, 2020, medical staff claimed four inmates tested positive on Dec 10th and has been sent into isolation in gym- in the gym. My brother being one of them. One full passed when a new list was created reflecting 40 people were being rolled up for possible contamination and any one four were being sent to the gym for isolation. Initially, I was slated to be housing in quarantine, seven building, along with my dorm mates.</br></br> 

However, correctional staff who knew my brother and I took it upon themselves to move me into the gym to be with him. While it's not my intent to get these individuals in trouble, but it does show that correctional staff did break have a significant role in the mass movements.</br></br>
 
My brother experienced every symptom known prior to being tested positive and even passed swab testing twice. Another dorm mate also dispaced every tell-tale symptom and he too went undetected for an additional week before testing positive. This feat proves testing fallacy and that temperature, blood pressure, and oxygen testing twice a day by nursing staff failed to disclose any COVID or flu-like symptom.</br></br>
 
My brother still suffers from lingering side effects of COVID. I on the other hand never had any symptom and to this day believe my test was a false or positive. During my time in isolation, nurses came twice daily doing welfare checks and  asked four different nurses for a retest to invalidate the false positive test. Their replies were: "If you are in this gym, you tested positive and there is no need to retest." Refusing to retest not only me but many like me compounded the belief that some upper-management directive was in place.</br></br> 

And medical staff's intended to infect as many inmates as possible to create herd immunity.</br></br>
 
The environment in the gym was unsanitary and over-crowded. In the building, beds were separated by six feet. However this wasn't the case in the gym. Beds were so compacted that they were three feet apart.</br></br> 

And ultimately, medical and custody staff warehouse 107 inmates by double bunking each bed. A place ordered to be shut down by a three- by a federal three judge panel. T0 make matters worse; dust, mice, and mold is everywhere. The roof leaked severely allowing rain to flood living areas and destroying personal property.</br></br>
 
Still, more and more inmates were brought into gym. Some inmates had serious health conditions and should have been placed into a cell. Also, inmates from all yards were being cornored into a single environment ensuring that COVID was spread throughout the prison.</br></br>
 
On one occasion in the gym we had the warden, chief deputy warden, and the chief medical executive of prison along with many high ranking staff hold an impromptu discussion concerning our issues:</br></br>
 
Issue one: after 14 days in the gym (isolation) we were subject to move to any open bed on any yard. This is a problem because many would lose their jobs or programs and this subject them to being placed into a hostile environment.</br></br>
 
Upon release from gym, all personal property is placed in quarantine for three days. Including essential day-to-day cosmetics such as soap, shampoo, toothbrush, toothpaste, shower shoe and a comb or brush. Warm clothing was also denied. This is an unhealthy hygiene concern.</br></br>
 
Issue three: the gym is overcrowded and not in compliance with social distancing regulations. Beds are not six feet apart. The roof leaks and cleaning supplied are not being made available.</br></br>
 
COVID is spreading because staff are housing people together who are infected whith those who are not. This is created high anxiety amongst the inmates. Building 16 and 23 had no inmates in them and at one point these building could be used to house all positive cases. 16 for C yard inmates and 23 for D yard inmates.</br></br>
 
Issue five: For those experiencing serious COVID symptoms or for those with pre-existing conditions need to receive treatment for their ailments and make doctor visit available.</br></br>
 
There were other issues as well but I highlight these to reflect correctional and medical staff negligence and indifference towards inmates health and safety. They were dismissive, unwilling to be open to suggestions to real problems. Their attitude reflected: "How are inmates suggest positive reforms." "Inmates don't have a voice, they are supposed to just do what they are told."</br></br>
 
Clearly I, along with many experience Solano's inept response to COVID, believes that staff took purposeful and deliberate actions to infect the inmate population. Any person who survives this hell would come to the same conclusion.</br></br>
 
Upon leaving the gym, I was moved into several buildings which were quarantined even though I was resolved. Could go to any building because I can not infect nor get infected for 90 days. Yet I could not go to work or receive daily program. Again, I was manipulated and lied to and forced to remain on lockdown until all inmates became resolved or the vaccine is made available.</br></br>
 
Since February 2021, the Moderna vaccine has been given to initially those inmates never infected regardless of age. This became random whether infected or not. I self-reported to medical staff on multiple occasions that my 90 days was set to expire within three weeks and request the vaccine so I can remain safe. Many inmates who only recently been diagnosed as COVID positive were given vaccine while I was ignored and not placed on any priority list.</br></br> 

Two days before expiration date, I told a nurse whose response was: "We'll get to you when we get to you. In the mean time you have a choice on whether to test again or not." That foul attitude sealed my decision.</br></br>
 
As of March 9, 2021, my called 90 days window has expired and I am refusing to participate in any temperature checks, swables, or interested in taking the vaccine. I don't trust the medical staff at all. They have failed repeatedly in every aspect to address my needs to demonstrate they care about me. Being that half of correctional and medical staff had refused to be vaccined which also doesn't build my confidence in the significance of the vaccine or it's long-term effects.</br></br>
 
The entire ordeal represents just one of many occasion to which I been subject to prison induced trauma in my 35 years incarceration. In spite of my repeatedly traumatization, I'm still trying to move forward and share my story. A story which occurred here at Solano state prison and was clearly avoidable and requires reforms to be made to prevent further injustice.</br></br>
 
I hope this story somehow assist you and your fellows classmates. Should you need to seek follow up questions or for clarity, don't hesitate to write again.</br></br>
 
Stay happy, healthy, and hopeful.</br></br>
 
Best wishes.
