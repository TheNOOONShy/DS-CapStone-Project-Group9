Hello friends,</br></br>

I am at this time at the Pleasant Valley State Prison institution.</br></br>

Thank God I find myself in good health, and I hope that you are also in good health with your families and loved ones.</br></br>

First of all, personally I was surprised because I never imagined that this virus would spread throughout the entire world. And it made me reflect on how small we are in the universe and how being a humanity developed with science, we have been reduced to something small.</br></br> 

And something that this COVID-19 has taught me is that as humans we have to help one another as a family in this universe. Our home that we call earth is a very special planet.</br></br> 

It is a gift that we have to protect and protect ourselves. And it has taught me that to help other people and to try to protect ourselves as much as possible. My family is small; mom, dad, and three sisters. I have a small family; thanks to God they are okay.</br></br>

My dad is well. He lives in Guatemala and it was a worry that I had but he is living healthy. And my mom is well, she has not been infected thanks to the fact that she is taking care of herself when she goes out.</br></br> 

Two of my sisters were diagnosed with the virus and I was worried about them so much but everything went well for them. They recovered quickly, in two weeks they had recovered and were taking care of their families.</br></br> 

In regards to me I'm trying to do the best I can to be protected, and clean, and wash my hands, and wear my mask at all times. And keep my distance in order so that we get out of this problem as soon as possible and return to normal again.</br></br>

Family visits are difficult because we canâ€™t see, touch, or hug them. It would be better if they could visit us again. Difficult but we all have to do our part if we want everything to return to normal.</br></br>  

And treat everything calmly and patiently that everything has a purpose. And we have to take this with a different perspective and learn for what is coming in the future. Something bigger may or may not happen. But we should learn from this experience and be prepared.</br></br>

Well I was very pleased to be able to share this letter with you and I hope that when you receive it you are well. When you want to write to me here is my address. I need a friend with who to write.</br></br>

Sincerely.
