This story was told by a person incarcerated at Mule Creek. </br></br>


Caller: I thought to myself, “You know, I don’t want to die like this.” I was in a corner and I started crying. I started panicking because I thought to myself, “If I don’t have it, I sure in the hell am gonna get it now,” because I’m next to this individual who literally sounds like the poor guy is dying over here and they weren’t doing anything for him and it was horrible and I remember sitting there, laying there in my bed just panicking and that was my first day there, and I mean, I couldn’t do anything. </br></br>


I was literally, I felt helpless, I felt so alone that I couldn’t do nothing about the situation.
