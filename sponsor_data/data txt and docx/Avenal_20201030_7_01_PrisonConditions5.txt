UCI: What do you think is irrational about the authority that you’ve noticed in regards to their response to the virus?</br></br>Caller: The most irrational was when our building was 90 percent of the population was positive, and they brought people, they brought 12 people from another yard into our building and we talked to them and we were like, “Hey are you positive too?” and they were like, “No, we’re negative.”</br></br>So why did they bring a bunch of negative people into a building that’s almost entirely positives? And then someone like me who just like wearing masks, well I get it they enforce it more around the medical staff to put up a front but when we go into the chow hall we sit tables you know, tables are pretty close to one another and you have to take your mask off there, they’re trying to rush you.</br></br> The tables being sanitized while in between feedings, so that table’s like a shared surface with whoever ate there before you. There’s things there that just don’t, you know.</br></br> 

And then like at night you don’t sleep with a mask on so the air that you’re breathing in your dorm, you don’t have a mask on at night and you have a bunkie that’s less than six feet above you, and he’s eating at whatever table, so I mean there, it’s, you can’t contain it in here. You know the best containment that they could possibly do is the separation between us and staff.
