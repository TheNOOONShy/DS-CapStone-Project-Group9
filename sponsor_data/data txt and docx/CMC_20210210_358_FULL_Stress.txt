This letter was written by a person incarcerated at CMC (California Men’s Colony).</br></br>

During the COVID-19 pandemic, I was afraid I was going to die. During the time of the pandemic I was being stalked by Beyonce Carter, by the prison moving me around from hospital to hospital.</br></br>

I luckily lived by the grace of God. I got the vaccine shot. I am a celebrity. Hopefully I will be getting out soon to continue to write my movies and books. Please look out for me in Atlanta. Some celebrities like Jay-Z are stalkers. I don’t have an agent or a SAG card. Until next time.</br></br>

P.S. I live in Hollywood. How did you find me?
