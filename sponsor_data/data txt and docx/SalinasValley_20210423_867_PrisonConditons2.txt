This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Salinas Valley.</br></br>

Question one: what’s its been like in prison during the COVID-19 pandemic? At the beginning it was somewhat hectic. We were slowly place on lockdown and only medical emergency workers movement. We’re issued one mask at a time. Then given one or two a week for a few months.</br></br>

No gloves, nor hand sanitizer, then months later access to hand sanitizer when allowed phone use only. We were and are still being issued “non-alcoholic hand sanitizer.” Cheaper soap once a week, recently we now get extra soap. But here in (SVSP) Salinas Valley State Prison the soap we’re issued is the size of a half dollar coin, four times as thick.</br></br>

Basically we get one bar every other day, we can ask for an extra now. I get one mask every few weeks if that, unless I ask three four times for one. They don’t clean cages nor cells, etc., with disinfectant but once a day if that.</br></br>

That’s been at the beginning, middle and end of this pandemic. I feel CDCR have also continue to “fail to” safely and correctly provide me and all CDCR inmates with the safety, consideration, services and constant safety COVID supplies. We all need inmates and CDCR staff.</br></br>

Since this COVID-19 pandemic began, I have been in three different prisons. Between July 2020 and now April 2021. So I have some ideal and experienced at (LAC) Lancaster, California Prison, (CTF) Central Training Facility Soledad, California. And that’s where I contracted COVID-19. Through their staff OK, neglect and refusal to follow and adhere to CDCR, CDC, COVID safety procedures.</br></br>

And staff reprisal for my constant complaints and letters to California Prison Focus and Prison Law Office, warden, etc. As well as COVID stories and complaints I’ve filed with [redacted] who’s representing outside organizations. “For CDCR’s disable inmates,” which I am hearing and mobility impaired.</br></br>

Which those attorneys are and have file writs on this COVID issue, on behalf of CDCR disabled inmates, and all inmates I believe. (Still I fear for my safety in prison.) One I believe the conditions, lack of safety protocols followed in my case was intentionally and extremely increased.</br></br>

Due to my situation at CTF where filthy and contaminated clothes were intentionally placed two feet in front of my cell at CTF for weeks to a month or more. Plus I had to use a shower with a plugged up drain, the over 50 or more inmates were forced to use, that was cleaned only once a day, if that.</br></br>

No hand sanitizer with alcohol. Inferior soap, no gloves. Also having the same mask three to four days at a time before issued new mask. All these lack of mask, etc., conditions and circumstances continue.</br></br>

As well as get worse, as CDCR administration, its staff and all its inmates are getting three times lacking in safety not adhering to and following CDC and CDCR safety protocols as much. And less than ever before, now in April 2021.
