This story was told by a person incarcerated at El Dorado County Jail.</br></br>

Caller: But, yeah, the Placerville Jail right now is – it's a nightmare. It's a fucking nightmare.</br></br>

And they're just — everybody there has COVID. They're not — they're not requiring their staff to get vaccinated. And, so, about - months ago, so I've been in custody since last year, and I was in general population, and they — somehow, they — they moved me from general population to max security.</br></br>

Put me in there with known violent offenders. They put me in a cell with somebody that was in there for kicking a pregnant girl in the head. He ended up biting my ear off. I'm not exaggerating. Biting my ear off.</br></br>

UCI: Oh, wow.</br></br>

Caller: They did nothing — they did nothing to repair the ear.</br></br>

UCI: They just left it? They just left you like that?</br></br>

Caller: Yes. They took me to the hospital, they stitched it up, but they didn't recover the piece of the ear. Still — I'm still — my ear is deformed.</br></br>

UCI: Mhm.</br></br>

Caller: They did — they still have not allowed me to get help for it, not — not sent me to a surgeon, nothing. I'm still trying to get ahold of, you know, some civil rights attorneys and some injury attorneys or somebody, but right now I'm just — I'm just waiting. I've only got - weeks left or whatever waiting to get out, so I'm looking for help.</br></br>

They have done nothing to help me. In fact, I got punished for it. I got — so my — I get my ear bitten off. They put me on 24-hour lockdown for 30 days, and then they extend it.</br></br>

In Placerville, when you're in trouble, you get in more trouble. You get, like, so they justified keeping me on 24-hour lockdown for 100 days straight. I only came out of my cell every other day for 15 minutes to take a shower.</br></br>

UCI: But why did they — so they punished you for getting your ear bit off?</br></br>

Caller: Yes. They said that it was a mutual combat and that I was the aggressor.</br></br>

UCI: Oh.</br></br>

Caller: They said it was mutual combat. They said that I was the aggressor.</br></br>

UCI: Mhm, okay. I see, yeah.</br></br>

Caller: And, so, but the reason — the reason why they did that was so that they had justification to keep me locked down. To suppress me.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: So to distance themself from having any responsibility.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, so they don't have to deal with whatever you have to say about what actually happened, yeah.</br></br>

Caller: Right. And they — they wouldn't allow me to use the phone for 100 days.</br></br>

UCI: Oh, wow. And that was when your — yeah, that was when your ear was — your thing with your ear was happening, so that, yeah, that probably wasn't good for yourself — for your ear.</br></br>

Caller: No, yeah. And, so, they — here's the thing. After the — it happened, I — so I picked up my piece of ear off the floor, and I put it in a cup of water; right? And when they came up there, they had their tasers drawn, and I tried to hand them the cup — the cup with the ear in it, and they said put it down.</br></br>

And I was, like, you know, I need that. And, so, they cuffed me and then they took me to medical and they said, “Oh, oh, mutual fight. Somebody lost their ear.”</br></br>

They — so they rushed me to the hospital. I'm, like, where's my ear? And they didn't recover it for, like, an hour and a half later. And they're — the doctor is, like, well, it's been so long we can't reattach it now.</br></br>

The tissue's become necrotic. If we tried to stitch it back, it would just fall off. So we're just going to have to stitch it up as it is. And, so, there's more than half of my left ear was bitten off.</br></br>

UCI: And, so, they just left it – they just left it like that? Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, they left it like that. So my ear, it's — it's - it's totally disfigured. It's — there's only, like - like half of it's gone.</br></br>

And, so, they put me in — in isolation for four months. I couldn't call anybody. It's — it's healed now, but it's still deformed because half of it's missing.
