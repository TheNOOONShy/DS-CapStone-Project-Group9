Hi PrisonPandemic,</br></br>


First of all, thank you for taking the time out of your day to send a letter, as well as for the kind words. Even though you most likely sent those same words to other inmates, they meant something and they put a smile on my face. I hope you’re well and that your time is succeeding in your PrisonPandemic Project.</br></br> 


I’m glad that there are people like you that are interested in what we are going through in the system. In these hard times, everyone seems to concentrate on themselves and I don’t blame them. From what I’ve seen in the news, there are people doing worse than I am. Whatever the outcome of your project is, I hope my story can help.</br></br>


My name is [redacted] and I’m a 32 year old man paying my debt to society. Unfortunately, I made a few mistakes in my life that led to my incarceration at the age of 24. Thank God this nightmare is coming to an end soon, for I am ready to move on with my life.</br></br>


Recently, serving my sentence has become more difficult. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, this prison CAC has implemented several changes. They began around March of 2020 with the cancelation of visits, restricted movement and locking us down 22 hours of the day. All this to prevent the spread of COVID, which did not happen until around November.</br></br>


During this modified program, inmates have not been able to go to work, go to school, go to any self help groups or walk to the dining hall for meals. We were not allowed to interact with anyone outside our pod. It went from going to yard everyday with the other three buildings (four in total with three pods each and 100 inmates per pod) to going to yard maybe twice a week with only my pod, of course.</br></br>


Dayroom used to be open 10 hours out of the day. This is when everyone in the pod is allowed out the cell to watch TV, use the phones, shower, and socialize with the other inmates. Since March, each cell is let out one hour and, if we are lucky, I have to make my phone calls and take a shower in that hour or I’ll miss out. One good thing that helped was the free phone calls provided by Global Tel Link. I was able to call people that may not be able to put money on the phone on the consistent basis.</br></br> 


In November, when several inmates tested positive, the institution shut everything down for two months. I was not able to call my relatives for the holidays. We did not get out our cells for those two months. Of course, we suffered the consequences when one of these correctional officers brought the virus into the facility. We don’t have contact with anyone else but them. At this time, nurses started checking our temperature maybe twice a week. Any individual that had symptoms would be moved to a building with other quarantined inmates.</br></br> 


I almost forgot to mention that the facility did not run canteen at one point because it was too much work without the inmates’ help. Do you know how much canteen means to us? I cannot survive on a bologna sandwich and a dinner that can equal the size of a Happy Meal. I need my canteen!</br></br>


In March this year, the prison offered the Moderna vaccine to every inmate. We had the option to refuse but the majority of us took the vaccine just so we can move on from this modified program.</br></br> 


We want our regular visits and have the chance to get out of our cells. At this moment, we still are only allowed one hour or two in the dayroom each day. Yard is still three a week with my pod only and they have finally started running education for those enrolled. I can’t wait for everything to get back to normal. Time moves slower when you’re stuck in a cell all day.</br></br>


As far as safety, I did not worry because we all had to wear masks and had minimal contact with COs. One event that was real difficult and still affects me is my older sister passing away. She passed due to other circumstances. She did not get a proper funeral because of the restrictions L.A. County had at the time. Matter of fact, those free phone calls helped a lot in those difficult times…</br></br>


How have I been coping with the crisis? Fortunately, I was able to continue with my college education through correspondence. I had nothing but time to focus on my assignments. I really appreciate the fact that the college allowed us to continue through all this. Reading books is another pastime of mine.</br></br>


This has basically summarized my life for the past year during this pandemic. I don’t know if any of this has helped in your cause, but if there is anything else I can do to help you out, please don’t hesitate. Mail is always a plus and you see how boring it’s been in the past year stuck in a cell. Hope to hear from you.</br></br>

Sincerely,
