This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Delano.</br></br>

[redacted], my name is [redacted]</br></br> 

I just wanted to thank you for ur letter and ur kind words. And yes I would like to share my experiences and my story of what it has been like to be in county jail and in prison during the COVID-19 pandemic.</br></br>

I was in Riverside County Jail during the pandemic. I was at Southwest Detention center when Covid-19 hit. They put us on lockdown 23 ½ hours a day and sometimes we wouldn't leave our cell for up to 3 days.</br></br>

We get a half hour a day to shower and use the phone. They gave us masks but no cleaning supplies, just a bar of soap. At time we would be locked in our cell all day for two to threedays because of breakouts or cleaning, those times were really often and really hard.</br></br> 

We get fed in our cells, and we would have to shower ourselves using water from the sink. When we would get called to courthouse, we would then again be packed in a holding cell, the six feet rule didn't apply to us till you were in court, then they would keep us 6 feet apart.</br></br> 

The hardest part of it all was the lockdown day in and day out. That was the situation in Riverside County Jail.</br></br>

I'm in [redacted] at North Kern State Prison 'Delano'. Here the program is better, we get yard and day room twice a week. Right now we get no visits, I haven't seen my family in close to a year now, since the pandemic started. Here we get to use telephone to stay in touch with family.</br></br>

We get to use the phone one time a week and we can only make one 15 minute phone call. I was  waiting all week long to get in touch with my family to get my one phone call. The officer in the tower was opening cells in order to use the phone.</br></br>

For some reason they didn't open my cell. When they did open my cell for med call. I went to the tower and asked the officer why he didn't open my cell, and I've been waiting all week. The officer said the he doesn't give a F and told me to F off.</br></br>

I told him this wasn't right. He then picked up a block gun and pointed it at me. I told him ur going to shoot me because Im asking about my phone call. He said yea I'll F-ing shoot you.</br></br>

Like he can do whatever he wants. I told him he's a real “B” then I turn to walk away back to my cell, when his partner standing to my left started spraying me in the face with a full can of mace. I was completely caught off guard by this, he blind sided me and gave me no warning or commands.</br></br>

He just sprayed me in the face and continued to spray me even though I was just standing there with my eyes closed. I didn't think they could just spray you for no reason. The officer I was talking to was in a tower, I was no threat to him or anyone. They just sprayed me all in my face in a vindictive way.</br></br> 

I was bullied and assaulted then the officer tells the whole unit that they don't get their calls because of me, creating an unsafe environment for me. This can't be legal but these cops do whatever they want that is one story to give you an idea what its like to be locked up during the pandemic.</br></br>

I hope these stories help with positive reforms.
