This story was told by a person incarcerated at Chuckawalla.</br></br>

Caller: Well, it started like when the pandemic started out there. They started locking stuff down and all that and eventually worked its way into the prison system. And currently it's still in the prison system and there’s still currently outbreaks happening in the other yards.</br></br> 

And this yard, the facility has four yards and one of the yards that I’m on didn’t have an outbreak at all. Like we had no, zero cases whatsoever. And then they happened to have one of the buildings got sick. They emptied it out and our building ended up being the only one without any positive cases for a long, long time. For like three straight months.</br></br>One day they, they found two positive cases in our building and they moved them out of the building. They isolated them. And two days later they made an announcement that the whole building was moving out. The whole building got together, all the inmates in the building got together and said we refuse to move.</br></br> 

And medical said, do you understand the risk you guys are taking? We said yes absolutely, we do. But we also understand that the people that moved, like that went to isolation so they won’t get sick came back sick. They came back positive. So, we are, refuse to move anyways.</br></br>And they tested us again that same week, on a Friday. And they end up, all of a sudden, we’re all positive. Like four, five hours later everybody ends up being positive. And they start moving people left and right. At like at 10 at night.
