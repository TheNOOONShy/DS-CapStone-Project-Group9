This story was told by a person incarcerated at New Folsom.</br></br>UCI: So was there anyone else that refused to get their vaccine?</br></br> Caller: There’s been several people that didn’t take it for whatever purposes that they didn’t’ do it. I would’ve taken it. The only reason I didn’t take it is because of my medical condition requires me not to take it.</br></br>And then when I was telling the nurses and showing them the instructions on my medical paperwork, then they tell me “Oh, it’s not a vaccine.” I said “What do you mean it’s not a vaccine?”</br></br>And so they start telling me this other stuff and I said “Okay, well if it’s not a vaccine, then why are you trying to get me to take it anyway?” It’s just been up in the air, and as of right now, I’m still trying to get a response to my medical appeals. I filed two or three medical appeals, tryna get a response to why such action was taken.</br></br>And then at first, when I was trying to have them put me in the infirmary until it’s confirmed that this is positive and that I have this, they had sergeant coming in to then, they was trying to set me up to where I was gonna get into physical altercation with all the inmates trying to yell all over the kid that I’m putting everybody else in danger and this and that.</br></br>And that I got COVID-19 and they were violating all the medical protocols and custody protocols when it comes to that. So, to keep the peace because we had a lot of people in uproar—some with the custody and some against what they were doing—and so I just went down there and did the 14 days of quarantine.</br></br>And the thing is that nobody in this section was tested positive. And see, I don’t go outside cause I’ve been social distancing with my medical conditions since 2013. So, the only time I go outside is to go to canteen, pick up my special purchase or package, and go to the law library and go to medical ducat.</br></br>So I’m wondering, if nobody in this section has COVID-19, and they go outside everyday, and I’m staying in my cell, and I don’t even go to the shower and when I do go to the showers and I’m clean, I just bird bath in my cell.</br></br>And so nobody else have it in this section and I don’t come out of my cell—that was my own little self-made bubble—then how did I catch it and how did nobody else in here got it.
