Caller: Well, mentally I have a- there’s a select group of guys that I play cards, and I read, -</br></br>

UCI: Mhmm.</br></br>

Caller: - and I write, and I just kinda take my mind off - I do a lot of sleeping to tryna recover and that's basically all that we can do. Those are my coping skills is that I try to deflect to where I’m not really focusing- cause it will cause a lot of stress and anxiety if I just focus on my current condition right now because it’s out of my control. 

UCI: Mhmm.</br></br>

Caller: It’s out of my hands and without help or assistance from the outside- it’s like we’re at the mercy of whatever arbitrary decision maker and the prison structure makes and we’re at their mercy.</br></br>UCI: Right.</br></br>Caller: And so I just try not to, I try not to be confrontational with them. I just observe, I document, and I report what I see, and you know I just kinda keep record, and that's the strength that I draw from.
