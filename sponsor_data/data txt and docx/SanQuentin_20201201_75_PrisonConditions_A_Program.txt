This letter was written by a person incarcerated at San Quentin.</br></br>

It’s the end of February, beginning March, some volunteers have begun to discontinue their rehabilitation groups out of an abundance of caution. Now the San Quentin prison population becomes alarmed.</br></br>

We discuss the situation among ourselves, still downplaying its seriousness if only to assuage our fear, but we can all feel it. Somewhere deep inside we all know that this is somehow different and unfamiliar.</br></br>

We look around and begin to take stock of the prison and its condition. We become terrified at what we see: filth, lack of proper ventilation, lack of proper sanitizing material, and decades of official autonomy and neglect.</br></br>

As we recognize the precariousness of our situation, we begin to speak out and complain. Our complaints fall on deaf ears. For those of us who are able to understand what’s coming we beg prison officials to open the buildings’ windows for ventilation. NOTHING!</br></br>

We beg for proper social distancing and masks. NOTHING! We beg to be released. NOTHING! We beg for protection. NOTHING!</br></br>

So, we sit in our small cages and wait and watch as news media documents Covid - the Angel of Death – march across the continent toward us. It is delivered to our doorstep on May 22, 2020, in the form of a transfer of 122 infected men from Chino State Prison to San Quentin State Prison; and all hell breaks loose: 30 dead and counting, thousands sickened and counting.</br></br>
