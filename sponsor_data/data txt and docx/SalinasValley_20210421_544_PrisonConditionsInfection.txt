This story was told by a person incarcerated at Salinas Valley.</br></br>


UCI: So, that leads me to my next question. What would you say that they could do to make the situation better?</br></br>


Caller: What they can do to make the situation better is that they can bring disinfectant to these poor inmates to use, to have. They can squirt it on their hands and use it everyday. The masks that they give out now and then, they don’t give them out all the time. The officers need to wear their masks on their faces; they need to disinfect themselves and they also need to wear PPE gloves and everything else constantly. You know, seeing people, they speak with people -- some have them and some don’t. Some officers don’t care, some officers do care.</br></br> 


UCI: Hm.</br></br>


Caller: You know? So, for as far as them doing something better than what they’re doing, I don’t see how they will because they never do.</br></br>


UCI: Hm. Okay, and what else do you want the people to know about your experience?</br></br>

Caller: Well, the experience here is, it’s more dangerous here than it is in society because COVID goes through our vents. So, if somebody has COVID, they cough, it’s coming through the vent, and every, every room is getting it. Every room is gonna get it. I wear a mask in my room; I wear it in my room because I know that the ventilation system is open like that, you know? And I feel like, you know, these here facilities are not fit to basically protect human beings from getting viruses like that of any kind. They need to look at the older individuals and get them out of there. Anybody with underlying health issues, they need to get them out.
