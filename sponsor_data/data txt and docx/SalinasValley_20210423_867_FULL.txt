Hello PrisonPandemic,</br></br>

I hope you, your team and your professor are all well and in the best of god loving care. Also staying safe in these troubling times of COVID-19. I know it’s not easy to stay as safe here nor out there with this COVID situation. Yet and still, we all must follow and adhere to the health and safety protocol, here more so.</br></br>

Due to the conditions and circumstances, and lack of real concern for inmates in prisons in California, to say the least. By its own administration of CDCR, etc., whom constantly show deliberate indifference to the staff’s reprisal, harassment, neglect, etc., inmates like myself who tell our stories, file institutional grievances, appeals or more.</br></br>

On the neglect of health care, safety protocols, etc., not being followed to the point of cruel and unusual punishment and abuse. As I was while in (CTF) Correctional Training Facility. When around November 26, 2020 I was “confirmed I had in fact contracted COVID-19.” But was not told till days, week or so later.</br></br>

After being in CTF for about three to three and a half weeks. With piles of 40-50 or more pounds of filthy clothes. Including COVID-19 contaminated clothes and four to ten mattresses, two to five large laundry carts full of filthy and contaminated clothes. (Intentionally placed) about two to three feet in front of my cell 24-7.</br></br>

Door has about three to four inches gap at bottom of my cell. Plus the larger back cell windows were broken out and windows faced outside ad seg yard cages, one and a half to two feet from my back window. With dog cages for ad seg inmates’ yard.</br></br>

Even after I notified CTF, CDCR staff, COs, sergeant, and lieutenant for weeks that these problems not only existed, but that “I’m a high risk COVID case.” They did nothing to rectify or even attempt to follow COVID-19 and CDC protocols to protect me. Until I caught COVID and was considered COVID-19 positive November 26, 2020.</br></br>

When two prison COs, officer came and told me they were moving me to CTF segregation unit in COVID-19 positive inmates unit. Without me being issued any type of CDCR’s medical department’s documentation, to confirm to me I in fact have COVID-19 positive test results. I was issued said CDCR’s medical COVID-19 positive documents “weeks to months after.”</br></br>

I was placed in CTF ad seg COVID-19 unit. Then I was threaten if I would not go to a cell in that unit my TV might not work “if” I did not go to the COVID unit cell without CDCR, or CDC, medical COVID-19 positive documents, etc. Then my TV suddenly came up cracked and not working.</br></br>

Which CDCR refused to compensate me for. Then personal property of mine in CDCR staff care came up missing. Then they refused me CDCR personal property receipts to verify the exact property I have.</br></br>

These are only some of the retaliation I’ve been subjected to. Including my prison etc. canteen food items, missing and or contaminated constantly. I’ve had inmate request 22s and appeals on it simply vanish. And no investigations into it. On to those issues your letter ask me about.</br></br>

Question one: what’s its been like in prison during the COVID-19 pandemic? At the beginning it was somewhat hectic. We were slowly place on lockdown and only medical emergency workers movement. We’re issued one mask at a time. Then given one or two a week for a few months.</br></br>

No gloves, nor hand sanitizer, then months later access to hand sanitizer when allowed phone use only. We were and are still being issued “non-alcoholic hand sanitizer.” Cheaper soap once a week, recently we now get extra soap. But here in (SVSP) Salinas Valley State Prison the soap we’re issued is the size of a half dollar coin, four times as thick.</br></br>

Basically we get one bar every other day, we can ask for an extra now. I get one mask every few weeks if that, unless I ask three four times for one. They don’t clean cages nor cells, etc., with disinfectant but once a day if that.</br></br>

That’s been at the beginning, middle and end of this pandemic. I feel CDCR have also continue to “fail to” safely and correctly provide me and all CDCR inmates with the safety, consideration, services and constant safety COVID supplies. We all need inmates and CDCR staff.</br></br>

Since this COVID-19 pandemic began, I have been in three different prisons. Between July 2020 and now April 2021. So I have some ideal and experienced at (LAC) Lancaster, California Prison, (CTF) Central Training Facility Soledad, California. And that’s where I contracted COVID-19. Through their staff OK, neglect and refusal to follow and adhere to CDCR, CDC, COVID safety procedures.</br></br>

And staff reprisal for my constant complaints and letters to California Prison Focus and Prison Law Office, warden, etc. As well as COVID stories and complaints I’ve filed with [redacted] who’s representing outside organizations. “For CDCR’s disable inmates,” which I am hearing and mobility impaired.</br></br>

Which those attorneys are and have file writs on this COVID issue, on behalf of CDCR disabled inmates, and all inmates I believe. (Still I fear for my safety in prison.) One I believe the conditions, lack of safety protocols followed in my case was intentionally and extremely increased.</br></br>

Due to my situation at CTF where filthy and contaminated clothes were intentionally placed two feet in front of my cell at CTF for weeks to a month or more. Plus I had to use a shower with a plugged up drain, the over 50 or more inmates were forced to use, that was cleaned only once a day, if that.</br></br>

No hand sanitizer with alcohol. Inferior soap, no gloves. Also having the same mask three to four days at a time before issued new mask. All these lack of mask, etc., conditions and circumstances continue.</br></br>

As well as get worse, as CDCR administration, its staff and all its inmates are getting three times lacking in safety not adhering to and following CDC and CDCR safety protocols as much. And less than ever before, now in April 2021.</br></br>

Also, we deal with the mental and emotional aspect of the cell and institutional lockdown. And NO inmates visiting can and do affect inmates and their families and relationships negatively.</br></br>

Including reduced and no contact visiting with family and loved ones and friends. We constantly deal with the mental and emotional stress. Yet I feel to some degree it’s necessary to keep inmates and their families and loved ones safe.</br></br>

As far as vaccinations in CDCR and SVSP it’s going fairly well, a few minor drawbacks. I got both my shots already, but notice a large walnut size knot appeared on my wrist. Same day I got first shot. Then when I get second shot in left shoulder, knot on wrist go down 80 percent then return in about 24 hours.</br></br>

Plus a small knot appeared between my shoulder (left) and my neck by the big blood vein behind left ear on same day I got my second COVID-19 shot. I’m putting in a CDCR medical sick call slip to see a doctor on it. I saw a doctor about knot on wrist, who simply felt it, then dismissed it as nothing. I’ll keep you posted.</br></br>

Now I must prepare for possible reprisal. For simply sharing my truth and story with you. As CDCR staff read all my letters and phone calls. Due to me being an inmate advocate for CDCR disabled inmates.</br></br>

Well I’m at the end of my recounts of incidents, experiences, etc., on COVID. Almost forgot the medical services and care has and continue to be extremely lacking since COVID-19 began. It’s a little better now here in SVSP. Also I was transferred without COVID test to another prison twice from LAC to CTF, when CTF had an outbreak of over 345 hundred.</br></br>

Out of papers so end here. PrisonPandemic I will write you again soon. I have a request and questions.</br></br>

Sincerely.</br></br>

PS I’m 65 years with asthma, part lung missing with liver damage. High risk COVID.
