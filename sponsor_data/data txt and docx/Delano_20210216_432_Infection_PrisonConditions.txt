This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Delano.</br></br>

I recently filed a grievance regarding the neglect handling of the COVID-19 outbreak here.</br></br>

I was placed on quarantine along with my whole building, A1. As a result of several inmates testing positive on December 2020. Between December 23, 2020 through January 9, 2021, inmates continued to test positive in that building.</br></br>

I was tested three or four times and each resulted as negative. A total of over 56 guys tested positive and were moved to facility B or D. Ultimately after being quarantined for 21 days without any outside recreation, telephone calls to family, and no packages.</br></br>
 
On January 13, 2021, there was approximately 43 guys housed in facility building A1 who have all tested negative several times. No other inmates were housed with us. And then the craziest thing took place, medical or custody decided to move all of us that were negative of COVID-19 to an infected building. That being three or five block.</br></br>

So I was placed on an extended quarantine of 21 more days with the guys in building five because now they had experienced an outbreak. So I was tested several more times. Luckily, each produced negative results for COVID-19.</br></br>
 
I was isolated in my cell for 43 days for 24 hours a day, other than a 10-minute shower every other day. It was frustrating to see out my window, guys who tested positive return back to the fall program and privileges, after 14 days on seven days quarantine, on B or C facility. I felt like I was being penalized for testing negative, cause had I tested positive Iâ€™d been returned to general population.</br></br>

Finally on February 5, 2021, building five was lifted off quarantine.
