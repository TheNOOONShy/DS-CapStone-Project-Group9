This story was told by a person incarcerated at Donovan.</br></br>

Caller: Well, prior to COVID, I was getting visits like once a year, even though, my family lives, predominantly, about three hours away from here.</br></br>The rest of my family, they live in Las Vegas. So that's about a five-hour drive. So that was very difficult for them just to kind of set some time off of work to make it up here - I mean to make it down here from Las Vegas. I've been taking it fairly well. I do call home, just to check on my family.</br></br>But my parents, they do insist that I call more often. They want to make sure that I'm okay in here.
