Thank you for this letter. It’s good to know that people are thinking of us during this pandemic. Being in prison during this time has been a little scary watching people get the COVID-19 and them going man down slowly seeing everyone get it. I also got the COVID-19. I lost my smell and had a fever but lucky for me I got my smell back and recovered.</br></br> 

I feel safe now because everyone is getting the vaccine. I just got mine yesterday.</br></br> 

It sucks that they reduced visitation to virtual video because I would really like to see my family and loved ones in person. I just pray everyday people take care of themself because it’s sad to get on the phone and hear someone passed away. With this being said, hope you enjoy the rest of your day and take care.
