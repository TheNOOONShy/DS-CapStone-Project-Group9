This story was told by a person incarcerated at Corcoran.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah. You know what? I have a newsletter that I get that it has all the statistics on that and Corcoran is one of the ones that got hit the worst because this one is - especially if it’s dorm living. Because there’s so many people just stacked like sardines.</br></br>

UCI: Yep.</br></br>

Caller: In dorm living. And when - you can only imagine, in that it spreads like wildfire. In dorm living.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>

Caller: So, all the prisons that have dorm living got literally thousands of cases. Of positive cases.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>

Caller: Thous- since the pandemic started. </br></br>

UCI: And so.</br></br>

Caller: There have been - there - uh huh?</br></br>

UCI: It’s just - how does- how did the staff treat the people that were sick? Did anybody get any medicine? Like, were they quarantined? Like?</br></br>

Caller: No this is - I’ll tell you what they do. What they do is they take you and they lock you down in a cell. That's it. For 14 days.</br></br>

UCI: No medicine?</br></br>

Caller: They lock you down in the cell. No medicine. The nurses come around and just pretty much tell you to drink a lot of water. Stay hydrated.</br></br>

UCI: Wow.</br></br>

Caller: That’s what they do to them. That's what they do. They don’t give us, you know, electrolytes. They don’t - none of that. They just tell you.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: The only way is - you’ll go - is if you can’t breathe, then they’ll take you to the outside hospital. That’s literally - if you’re gasping for air - that’s the only way, that’s the only, that’s it. But other than that, you just get a 14-day quarantine and they just tell you to drink a lot of water. That’s it.</br></br>

UCI: That’s insane.</br></br>

Caller: If you test positive.
