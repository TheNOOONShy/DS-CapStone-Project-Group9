This story was told by a person incarcerated at an ICE/Private-Contractor facility.</br></br>

UCI: That's okay. I'll say it one more time. The whole court process during COVID, how has that been for you?</br></br>

Caller: They were going to court, and, like I said, the guys broke out with it. So then they said- they just told- everybody just got notices. Like, no court. I don't know if they closed-the courthouse here is part of the jail.</br></br>

So, I don't know if they closed the whole courthouse down or they just closed it down to us, but I guess apparently nobody was going to court. They just, if you had a court date, you just received a notice, and two weeks later you go to court. Yeah, they just flat out, they just weren't doing court, period.</br></br>

UCI: And has that affected you [unintelligible]?</br></br>

Caller: Well, I mean it did—I got skipped at—there was a court hearing, and I got skipped for that too. I guess the whole thing kind of affects me— like I said, the thing that really got me, at least other counties when they have COVID and stuff as far as jails and stuff, there were lesser offenses or whatever, the guys will release them or something or just not accept them. This jail just keeps them coming. That was the most part that affected me.</br></br> 

But, yeah, I was affected by the court thing too. I didn't get to go to court. I had a court date come up, and I had to wait until the following week or something. Then, especially, the unit I was on was a COVID- it wasn't a COVID unit I forgot how to say, a quarantine unit.</br></br>

So the guys, when they come down with it, we all get locked down and stuff. Like I said, they'll bring us a styrofoam tray. They started serving us sack lunches for dinner and some stuff. But, yeah, I got skipped for court too.
