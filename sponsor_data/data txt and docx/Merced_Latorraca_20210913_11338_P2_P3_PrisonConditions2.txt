This story was told by a person incarcerated at John Latorraca Correctional Center.</br></br>

UCI: And you said that they're getting their first shot but they're not getting their second shot. Do you know what kind of, I guess, timeline we're looking at, as far as the distance between the first one and the second one?</br></br>

Caller: No, I don't. I've just talked to inmates on the yard and stuff and different places, said they've got the first one but not the second one. I got the Johnson & Johnson. So I only had to get one. But there's - there's no set shot on what they - what they give here.</br></br>

It's just whatever the Health Department has, I guess, a surplus of at the time, they - they send down to our jail. So, sometimes, they'll have Moderna. Right? Sometimes, it's the Johnson & Johnson. Right?</br></br>

Sometimes, it's a - it's a different shot. So I got Johnson & Johnson. So I only had to do it once. But even that was pretty - pretty hectic trying to get it.</br></br>

You know what I'm saying? Just because there was - there was a vaccine shortage, I guess. But I don't know.</br></br>

UCI: Okay. And you said you had to wait about six months to get your shot?</br></br>

Caller: Yes.</br></br>

UCI: And how many times did you have to file a report to, I guess, get the shot?</br></br>

Caller: Aw, dude, I was turning in medical slips every week.</br></br>

UCI: Okay. So it seems like it's - it's like a challenge to even get the vaccine, even if you want it.</br></br>

Caller: Yes, it is. Because I don't know how it is at CDC prison right now. But, it at least, on the county level, they don't - they don't keep shots here. You know what I'm saying?</br></br>

The Health Department will send some over at various different times. And so it's real hit and miss. So, when - when you come in, you got to put a medical request slip in for the shot.</br></br>

And then, you got to wait until some vaccines show up. And then, once they do show up – you know what I'm saying – you got to hope that you're high enough on the list to get one before it runs out, or you get put over until the next shipment.</br></br>

UCI: Okay.</br></br>

Caller: And I know this because I asked medical. The nurse told me. That's why it took me so long to - to get my shot. Because I turned in a lot of request slips to get - to get the - the COVID shot.
