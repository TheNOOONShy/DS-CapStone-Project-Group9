Dear,</br></br> 


Hello there! I hope these few lines finds you and yours in the best of health and in high spirits. Well I received your little letter that you sent to me and I decided to write you back because you are an Anteater UCI. Ya I live in Laguna Hills off of the [redacted] parkway, on [redacted] street. My wife owned the house there so I figured I drop you a few lines.</br></br> 


So you want to know about how it is in here during the pandemic. Well I would have more rights if I was a chicken. Ya then the animal rights activists would be picketing outside because my cage is too small. Ya my cage is five feet wide and nine and a half feet long and that is for two people. Although I don't have a cellie, but a lot of guys do.</br></br> 


They tell us to social distance, but there is no way nor no room to do so. If i was a chicken they would fight for me to be free range. To social distance properly in here, they would have to have one person in every other cell to social distance right, but you know they aren't going to do that. I caught COVID, well they gave it to me. Ya the cells have bars on the front of them, so basically it's open. So we tried to hang sheets up so we, well I didn't breathe everyone's breath who walked by, but they said that wasn't allowed.
