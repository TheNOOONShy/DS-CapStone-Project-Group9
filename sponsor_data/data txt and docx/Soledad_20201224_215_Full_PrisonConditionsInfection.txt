Deat PrisonPandemic,</br></br>

Thank for you remembering us prisoners who feel like we are always forgotten. For some off reason or the other, us prisoners find a way to overcome. Thanks to generous people like yourself, many prisons continue with hope.</br></br>

My story I will share with you is disappointing to me, but I understand the concerns. Am currently not infected thanks to some cough drops and hay fever pills I intake to fight off any symptoms trying to grow within the body. The cellmate has tested positive about a month ago and is feeling fine. We both were sent in different directions for quarantine. Have returned to the same cell.</br></br>

As for other prisoners, they sound very lound and obnoxious. The toll of having to stay inside of a cell twenty-four hours feels like returning back to SHU term-segregated-housing-unit for violent men. The SHU was abolished in 2015, dismantled. Now men feel like they are right back in with zero offense having taken place.</br></br>

Thanks to prisoners family, men have a way to not erupt. I know the community must feel the same. Just like the public our safety is questioned, but who are we as prisoners when community doesn't have any right of a quick vaccine. Will conitnue coping with the crisis through patience!</br></br>

Sincerely.
