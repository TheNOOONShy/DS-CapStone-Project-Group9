Hello my name is [redacted],</br></br>
I’m a COVID survivor, I’m in a story from LA Times. I got COVID from PIA sewing factory. I was hospitalized from COVID. It was horrible, bad, and scary experience. I still have problem with breathing, my lungs are messed up from it.</br></br>
I’m in a unit that the coronavirus has spread to over 50 percent of the unit. I’m scared 'cause there’s no safety here. The people do not clean the unit good enough to say we’re safe. We can’t wash out clothes or clean our space here.</br></br>
We’re always in locked cells with no air-conditioners. This place doesn’t provide us 8 inches fans, we have to buy them but many don’t have family to provide. If you look at the place called, isolation it’s sad, broken windows, screens torn off, no cleaning, only one shower a day.</br></br>
The sick people have to pack up their cells and move them self across the yard while being ill. This prison tests randomly. Not all until a lot get ill.</br></br>
This time COVID broke out in my unit. Over 60 people got sick. So you know I’m so afraid. They don’t keep them in quarantine until 14 days is up.</br></br>
They let them back on the yard and didn’t test them again to see if they’re negative after they tested positive. The nurse said they can’t give us the virus although they tested positive. I believe it can still be transmitted to us.</br></br>
I’m scared it almost killed me. I’m still struggling breathing, this place has been hiding the amount of people who test positive. I don’t know except to pray for my freedom cause when I get out I’m going to speak, people need to know are conditions in here.</br></br>
The water is horrible also. I have the copy of LA Times Newspaper I was in it cause I was really sick.</br></br>

P.S. Write soon.
