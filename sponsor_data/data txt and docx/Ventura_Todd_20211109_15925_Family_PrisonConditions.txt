This story was told by a person incarcerated at Todd Road Jail.</br></br>Caller: Okay, well I was saying I don't get visitations, but I do - I do see that they're there. They do or - are helpful, but that's, that's just from what I know. And oh, I get - I get told to wear mask when - occasionally, you know, when I'm told to.</br></br>UCI: Okay, and then what about - what has it been like for you to have reduced programming?</br></br>Caller: Man, reduced programming, it - I mean it all depends, but it is - it is what it is.</br></br>UCI: I see. How have you been coping with the crisis?</br></br>Caller: I usually ask people, you know, or if they're, if they're in line to get anybody infected or have been exposed to COVID-19, and that's - that's it mainly.</br></br>UCI: Okay. I know you said you don't have any visitors, but how has the COVID situation affected your loved ones?</br></br>Caller: On - [unintelligible] apart, I'm not allowed to see my people or my family, and that is - that is part of the reason why, and I really don't blame them for, for being like that.</br></br>UCI: Okay. What would have made the situation at your facility better?</br></br>Caller: If we were let outside more often, hopefully. It's not my job. Yeah, I'm just here to be in, you know, there are certain guidelines that we all go in, you know? I guess.</br></br>UCI: Yeah. What else do you want people to know about your experience?</br></br>Caller: I want people to know, okay, to want to better themselves and, it's okay, you know, to find those resources that you need, that are there, you know? 24/7, you know? And they're out there, and you should go get them. You know?
