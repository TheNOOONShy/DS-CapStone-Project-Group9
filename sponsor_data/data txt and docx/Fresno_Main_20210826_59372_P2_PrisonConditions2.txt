This story was told by a person incarcerated at Fresno County Jail.</br></br>

Caller: They're hurting - I've sent a letter to my mother about the things like canteen, the money, the high money that we're spending in order to keep ourselves from getting sick or from going hungry, or whatever the case was on, you know, the canteen to help us out. They literally skyrocketed everything. Our soups are $1.15 to $1.26. That's high.</br></br>

UCI: Has the price changed since the pandemic?</br></br>

Caller: The priced changed. Yes, the price went up.</br></br>

UCI: What was it before?</br></br>

Caller: It was between a mid-dollar to a dollar.</br></br>

UCI: Okay. That sucks.</br></br>

Caller: Now everything's over a dollar, like everything to a dollar and a half.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, everything doubled.</br></br>

Caller: Yes. But see, in other facilities like state corrections, the soups are still $0.25 cents. The soaps are a dollar. No higher.
