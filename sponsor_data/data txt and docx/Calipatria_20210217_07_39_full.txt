This story was told by a person incarcerated at Calipatria.</br></br>

UCI: I can't imagine, you know, being isolated like you guys are. But if it's possible, I'd like to hear about your experience. Maybe, are you feeling-</br></br> 

Caller: What do you wanna know? Ask me. Ask away.</br></br> 

UCI: So, what is the current COVID-19 situation at your facility like?</br></br>

Caller: Let me see. Well, I caught COVID not too long ago.</br></br> 

UCI: I'm sorry to hear-.</br></br>

Caller: Hold on. Alright. Well, let me see. What do you wanna know?</br></br> 

UCI: So-</br></br>

Caller: How is it like in here?</br></br>

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: The whole building had COVID. So, at first, I don't know how I caught it, but I was one of the first few to catch it.</br></br> 

UCI: Mhmm.</br></br>

Caller: So, then, so they came to my door and they took me to the hole and they said I was gonna be isolated for a little while, just the 14 days and whatever. And then, and yeah, I went over there. And then, my cellie went along with me and then just, well actually, about, I want to say like, 90 percent of the building caught it. Caught COVID.</br></br> 

UCI: Mhmm.</br></br>

Caller: So we isolated. They took us to the hole and then they brought us back. Now, I'm an essential worker cause I'm a porter here at the prison.</br></br>

So, I'm helping clean, keeping things disinfected and stuff. And then, yeah, it's, I mean, some people got really sick but it's been alright for the most part. It hasn't been as bad as other prisons, I guess.</br></br>

UCI: And how is COVID, being handled at your facility at the beginning of the outbreak and has that changed as it's progressed?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, in the beginning it was cool. It was like, laid back, we just heard about it in the news. And then, and it was chill. Like, we'd just hear about in the news and you really didn't think like, at first I thought it was kind of like a hoax, like just a regular fever, you know what I mean.</br></br>

Like it wasn't that drastic, it wasn't that bad. And then people started actually catching it in prison and people started getting really sick. And then, I felt the symptoms. So I was like oh, shit.</br></br> 

It really is real. And then, they started providing us with masks and stuff like that. And, yeah, that's about it.</br></br>

UCI: And what can your facility do to make the situation better for you guys?</br></br>

Caller: Mmm, I guess. I don't know. Start opening up visits.</br></br> 

UCI: Mhmm.</br></br>

Caller: Visits would be cool. Because yeah some people, and maybe programs also. Because like the majority of our housing unit, is, there's 200 people housed in this unit, right?</br></br>

UCI: Mhmm.</br></br>

Caller: And then, the majority of us already caught it. So, we can't pass it to anybody, or get it again right?</br></br>

And then, but they're only, like they're not allowing us to get haircuts and stuff like that and-.</br></br> 

UCI: Mhmm.</br></br>

Caller: Just little stuff that, that people need, to make you feel good. You know what I mean. Like a haircut always make me feel better.</br></br> 

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: And for them to deprive you that, that's not cool. You get me? But, yeah.</br></br>

UCI: And what does that reduced visitation and programming been like in terms of being able to see your family, like, how has that affected you?</br></br>

Caller: Mmm, let me see. Well, the phone calls. We are not allowed to get more than, like, one phone call a day. So that's kind of like, it's a little strain on your relationship with like, like my girl.</br></br> 

So, with my ex-girl. And then, yeah it was, it was a little messed up. And then visits. Also visits. Visits suck cause you can't, I couldn't see my girl for a long time.</br></br> 

Well, still I can't see her. Now they're providing video visits, but yeah. And then, you only get one of those a month. So yeah. It sucks.</br></br>

UCI: Wow. That must be really hard-</br></br> 

Caller: It's not a-huh?</br></br> 

UCI: I'm sorry what were you saying?</br></br>

Caller: No, no, no, you go.</br></br>

UCI: I was just saying that, that must be really hard, and how are you coping with the crisis?</br></br>

Caller: Well, I got it good cause I told you, like I said, I'm a porter out here. So, I get to run around and, you know what I mean, help people out that don't get a chance to get out their cells, like I'm out here most of the day.</br></br>

So, I got it pretty good, you know what I mean, but other people they don't. They're stuck in their cells 24 hours a day. They only come out to shower and then take you back in your cell. So, that might be a little hectic on you, you know what I mean?</br></br>

UCI: Mhmm. Is there anything that's troubling, or concerning to you that is happening at your facility, in terms of COVID?</br></br>

Caller: Mmm, not really, cause look. How can, how could've anybody been ready for this? You know what I mean?</br></br>

UCI: Mhmm.</br></br>

Caller: They're trying to do all they can right. I know like they're not perfect. Everybody's always complaining about stuff right.</br></br>

So, we're always looking at the negative side of things. And it's like, yeah, you could complain about this and that but really how, they're trying to do better. They're giving us yard like every four days maybe. And I know it's not much, but it's something, and you gotta be thankful for it. You know what I mean?</br></br>

And it's like, yeah, they're slowly trying to make things more accommodating for us. You know what I mean? They're not going to get back to normal, but then who's life is normal? Not even on the streets, you know what I mean?</br></br>

UCI: Mhmm.</br></br> 

Caller: So, yeah. There's a lot of things they could do that would help us out, but they don't know how it's gonna affect in the long run, you get me?</br></br>

I mean, what if they do open up the program and then this new strain comes along and then we all catch it and we die. I mean, then people are gonna complain about that. So, it's like, I don't know. Maybe I'm a really optimistic person.</br></br> 

And, and I just don't look at the bad side of things. You know what I mean?</br></br>

UCI: Well that's okay. You know, I'm glad that you feel as though, things are going as good as they can. I mean, that's good to hear, definitely. Is there anything that you, you know, these calls are recorded, is there anything that you want people to know about your experience?</br></br>

Caller: Mmm. Nothing really. I mean. I've been down 15 years. So, it's like, I've probably just seen it all and, you get me?</br></br>

UCI: Mhmm.</br></br>

Caller: Just, I don't know. This is, yeah. It's not that bad.</br></br> 

UCI: It's not that bad.</br></br>

Caller: Oh, I'm sorry if you're looking for like a sad story.</br></br>

UCI: No, no, I'm-</br></br>

Caller: Like it, yeah. It sounds like that's what you're looking for. But yeah, I can't.</br></br>

UCI: No, I'm glad that you are not having a bad time. That is not what I'm looking for. I-</br></br>

Caller: I know.</br></br>

UCI: You know.</br></br>

Caller: It's not, like my whole family caught COVID. They all got COVID right now. Right?</br></br>

UCI: Mhmm.</br></br>

Caller: And we make fun of it. We're like, oh, hopefully you guys ain't dead. You get me? And then we'll, we just talk shit.</br></br> 

But, for, I guess I come from that type of family. So, it's pretty hard to- and yeah, I know what you guys are looking for.</br></br> 

I guess. If you guys are looking for reasons to complain and talk shit about the prison system, and this and that, yeah, I know it sucks but as far as the COVID situation, it's not that bad.</br></br>

UCI: Mhmm.</br></br> 

Caller: It's like-</br></br>

UCI: Well, I'm glad that you know, I'm glad that you have that experience. I really am. I know that. You know that we are obviously a place where you can call and talk to you and kind of like vent out.</br></br> 

Because, you know, unfortunately, like, with some of the calls that we have gotten, a lot of them are, you know, on the opposite side of the spectrum of what you're describing. Of people that are having a really hard time in their facilities. You know, aren't doing as much as they can.</br></br>

But it is honestly really good to hear, that your facility is handling it well, in your opinion, because, you know, that's, that's what we hope for. We don't want, you know, you guys to be calling and saying, this is awful, and, you know, we're all getting sick. Like we would like it to be that you guys are doing-</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, it was nice talking to you. Aye, do you guys got a pen pal service type of thing?</br></br>

UCI: Not necessarily pen pal, but you can write letters. But thank you very much for participating in PrisonPandemic. Please consider telling your friends about us. And seeing if they would like to call in or even write.</br></br>  

But definitely write letters if you would like. That's a great way for people to talk back and forth as well.</br></br>

Caller: Alright. Cool. You have a good night.</br></br>

UCI: You too. Thank you.</br></br>

Caller: Bye.</br></br>

UCI: Bye.
