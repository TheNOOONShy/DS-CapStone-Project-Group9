PrisonPandemic,</br></br>
Life in prison right now is extremely stressful, not able to see our families, no visits. For the most part, we are locked down 24 hours of the day in our cement box. Please help us change the prison system to more program life, dayroom, and more yard.</br></br>Not able to see our love ones our families, is so hard doing time. We can't live like this forever being slam down in this cement box. With no family visits.</br></br>There has to be hope for a change. Together we are way stronger than this COVID. More programs like self help groups, AA, NA, criminal thinking, anger management, anything to help inmates prepare for the outside world.</br></br>Change starts inside prison. United States of America. We all stand. We are all in this together. Thank you.
