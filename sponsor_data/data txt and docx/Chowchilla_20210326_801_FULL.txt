This story was told by a person incarcerated at Chowchilla.</br></br>

UCI: Okay and what is the current COVID-19 situation at your facility?</br></br>

Caller: Current - the current situation is, we - there were various newspaper articles printed by our administration in the real world. The free world is what we called it. And almost all the things on there were not accurate. They were stating that the transfers had stopped.</br></br> 

They stopped for a little while, they continued a majority of the time the whole year that we’ve been out. They continued most of the time. They only stopped within the last three months, and they started right back up again.</br></br>

So to speak, for today, we have orange people and people that are in reception centers and living in our C-facility. Different things different people have come here. We have transgenders that were transferred into prison, and they did 14 days on A-yard.</br></br> 

And now they’re living with us, within us. Within our, you know, sub-community and stuff. So, you know, the actual transferring of has been more of a headache than anything else.</br></br>

Because when COVID kicked based on the doctors and nurse that infected over 700 inmates today, we were all relocated different places. People lost all of their properties that they had for years. We were told, “Oh, you’re only gone for two weeks, so leave all your property behind." People were threatened, people - some people received Kronos note. Stating that they could come back to their housing units after the fact.</br></br>

It was just a whole bunch of nobody knew what to do, and the person in charge of it was our AW named, and his thinking logic just became unbearable for the inmates. He stressed out our staffs, our correctional officers that had to put in the bedrooms, and locate us, and relocate us and get us back and get us down there and all these different things. We didn’t have proper equipment to relocate our property with the six cubic feet that leaves.</br></br> 

We didn’t have that. Our hygiene and our food is not combined in the six cubic feet. Your personal things like your boombox, your television, your J-pay tablet, your clothes, those kind of things. You know, your college work, your attorney’s paperwork, all that kind of stuff. Being dragged around, from pulling and post with them.</br></br>

The living conditions themselves were, they were advertised that they had cleaning crews, there were no cleaning crews, they were basic inmates. They had no cleaning. They didn’t even know what cross-contamination was. Taking one rag from cleaning the telephones that had been used and using it on all the telephones.</br></br> 

That’s cross-contamination. These are the properties that we lived through that people are still living through. But they could create a janitorial, something just the prison, not connected with PIA that they had not done it.</br></br>

So, people are still getting infected. We have like six a day. One lady died. She was never advertised, we never make it to the news on what’s going down in our prisons.</br></br> 

Far as how many people contracted it, we were never included in the Moderna count to our knowledge. And this is how we’re living. Like, people are pretending one thing on paper, and it’s not the reality of what we’re living through.</br></br> 

So, on basis, the officers are now mad when you speak up and defend yourselves. With [unintelligible] to, but now they’ve started generating their own propaganda. To answer to, do away with the 602 process. “Oh no, we issue Sani-guards”.</br></br> 

The difference between issuing Sani-guards and cell block [redacted] is that Sani-guards is not carcinogenic. [Unintelligible], which is supposed to be Raid, as a disinfectant, deodorizer, whatever, whatever, that is a carcinogenic. So why would we want to use that? The officers use Sani-guards, so why not we use Sani-guards? [Unintelligible].</br></br>

UCI: Okay. I understand.</br></br>
 
Caller: What was your question?</br></br>

UCI: So it was generally what’s going on, and that completely answered it. And I’m sorry that you’re going through that right now, and I feel for you.</br></br> 

Caller: Yeah, we’re still going through it. Some of the units don’t have air conditioning with the direct air flow. Some of them have mold and have erosion, metal erosion in the bathroom, actually, in the showers, when you take a shower, the steam mixed with the erosion and mold, you’re still inhaling.</br></br> 

I don’t understand how I became asthmatic here when I was never asthmatic, and I lived out here in the valley. Never was I ever asthmatic, and now I’m an asthmatic with bronchitis. I believe it’s based off of mold and erosion. But you know, that doesn’t help anything when it comes down to COVID.</br></br>

So, different nurses, some of them are very caring, some of them are very passionate and talk to us like people and not addicts. Talk actually, with us when they came to take the vitals, we told them, as we told them what our symptoms were for the day, no smell, no sense of taste, headache, body temperature, whatever.</br></br>

And so I’m really down. They just put a zero because anyone can go work with it. So it was a lot going on, and it remains going on, you know? Part of me feels bad for the warden here because he's not actually the warden yet, and everything fell in his lap.</br></br> 

However, I just feel like he could get with the time, you know. We’re very fearful of catching it again. People have been told they could catch it again, and we don’t know whether that’s true or not, and they’re still saying they’re giving people temperatures. If they’re going to do vitals on people and do swabbing, and you know they’ve had it within the last 90 days, what is the point?</br></br>

UCI: Right.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, it’s a lot going on here. When we get off the telephone, there’s not a crew out here to sit down to wipe down the telephones. There’s no supplies available. These are the things that one of my associates made a lawsuit against the CCWF and CDC offer for females regarding the living conditions in here.</br></br> 

They’re cruel and unusual, bottom line. You know, when you have to live eight people per room with their CCTRP transfers, who are quarantined transferred inmates, when they’re going to CCTRP, they’re allowed to let four people per room. So how are you able to do it for them but can’t do it for the rest of us?</br></br>

Yeah, but I haven’t talked about the population. It’s at 135 percent, now we’re overextended. I was here when these rooms were made for four people only. We’re now living eight people to a cell.</br></br> 

Okay, with one toilet, we didn’t get an extra table, we didn’t get an extra chair, we didn’t get anything, an extra sink, or any of that. And now we’re living eight people per cell. And it’s not just because of the pandemic.</br></br> 

Okay, it’s over the sending them here, or the whatever, and they’re not - the CDCR are not moving females out of here fast enough to where it reflects the housing capacity. Okay, if we only have 60 people that are traveling CCTRP, what about the other 900 on the yards? Yeah, so what are your questions?</br></br>

UCI: So, I guess that the next would be, how has the COVID-19 situation been handled differently from the beginning of this outbreak? I guess March 2020 or whenever, you know, that you first start experiencing it.</br></br> 

Caller: Right. I think that it’s been handled differently that they originally gave us these man-made, inmate-made face masks. The cloth masks. The cloth mask is like a polyester/cotton lint that we wear for our orange.</br></br> 

And I believe that had we had those actual N95 masks as the very staff were given daily, then half of us wouldn't have been in this dire situation. 'Cause I had 12 out of the 13 symptoms and I have a heart condition. And you know, medium-risk for everything, and I was subjected to it without my consent.</br></br> 

I didn’t travel. I didn’t go to school to pick it up with my peers. I didn’t sit in the dayroom to pick it up. It was delivered by an officer or, a doctor or a nurse.</br></br>

Who, had they been actually doing the temperature check, we wouldn’t have been there anyway. They stopped them, they had nurses around the clock giving temperature checks at the gate in the beginning, and they lacked up on it.</br></br> 

Soon as they lacked up on it, COVID walked in here and destroyed almost more than - more than half the population. Every unit, there’s approximate 254 to 255 people, and almost everybody in there, maybe 16 people caught COVID. And the 16 that didn’t they, they had their own cleaning regiment which was three times a day, Sani-guard, and that’s how they avoided it.</br></br>

Okay, so now what do we do? Now we’re back to catching it, reinfecting ourselves with it. You know, the idea of even letting our family members know that, "Hey, I have the COVID right now, keep me at prayer,” or a card uplifting or anything, we were never given that opportunity. The various staff members refused to let us out of our cells.</br></br> 

We had no out-of-cell activities for seven days, nine days, three days, two days, and we're never told on our PA system within our unit saying, “Hey, you’re not getting program today.” We’re just standing at our doors waiting, like crazy people trying to reach our family members thinking that this, that we were gonna die, you know. To wake up everyday in prison to do your time is one thing, but to die before you complete your time is another.</br></br> 

UCI: Yeah that’s-</br></br>

Caller: I’m a nonviolent three-striker, and I’m still trying to figure out how to get out of here. And I’ve been down extra. I’ve been down a total of 28 years, but I have 21 years that I was supposed to be home based on Prop 57. And no one in this prison can help me get off.</br></br> 

So, I don’t know what to do with COVID. When it comes to again, do I submit, do I what? You know, is it gonna wipe me out this time? I don’t know what to do.</br></br>

UCI: That’s awful, and I'm sorry to hear that, and I hope that it gets easier, and you stay safe, of course, and healthy. So, you mentioned how you have less contact with your loved ones. Have you heard anything from them about how this situation in your facility has affected them?</br></br>

Caller: I know for a fact that when I spoke to my mother, who has been my ride or die this entire 28 years, I know that she was outraged that she couldn’t hear my voice every two days. I’m in my 50s, she’s in her 80s, and she’s like, “Babygirl, I don’t want to leave you dead or in that place. So you need to find a way to call me every two days."</br></br> 

And I know for a fact she called the administration of the CDC - of CCWF and got through to someone, and I was allowed to call her. So I don’t know, you know, I just know that her description is like having a child in the tree, or in a basket and you know, you can’t reach your child. That’s a description of how COVID and me being away from her after all these years, trying to get there, and COVID came, so, you know?</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, I understand. And then, I just have one last question before we end the call. How is the vaccination process been at your facility?</br></br> 

Caller: They actually started with the high-risk people. They gave them the opportunity, and now they’re to medium risk and I’m a medium-risk person, and I guess people come behind that. But I will give it to the nurses.</br></br> 

They are working around the clock in here, most of them, with a jovial attitude, and they’re not being pessimistic or anything. So they’ve been really polite, they explain any questions that I’ve asked them. And I received my card on Saturday. So, yeah.</br></br>

UCI: That is wonderful to hear, and thank you very much for participating in PrisonPandemic. Please consider telling your friends about us and seeing if they would like to call in.</br></br>

Caller: I most certainly will. You have a blessed day.</br></br>

UCI: You too.
