This letter was written by a person incarcerated at SATF (California Substance Abuse Treatment and State Prison).</br></br>

The state of California, including many of its prisons, jails, and detention facilities are under public and judicial attack due do you need to release prisoners and detainees solely due to the large scale pandemic of COVID-19 and itâ€™s far-reaching effects on the prisoners health and lives. The CDCR, especially CSP-SATF have failed and/or refused to take the necessary and meaningful steps to protect me (and other prisoners and their staff) from the exposure and ravages of COVID-19 (coronavirus).</br></br>

Furthermore, if and when the pandemic hits the CDCR harder than it has, the CDCR is far from equipped nor capable of handling such a broad reaching outbreak, and will not be able to treat all its prison population including its staff. The CDCR has failed and/or refused to set up a much needed monitoring and treatment plan of its prisoner population, and therefore many will suffer and possibly die because we are all in imminent danger to exposure from this death virus called COVID-19. I request immediate release of my person from the custody of the CDCR and placed upon supervised parole within 30 days.</br></br>
