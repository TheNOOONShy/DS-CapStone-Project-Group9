I’m not doing good. I gained major weight, I‘m still experiencing symptoms. I still have chest pains, but the EKG and X-ray shows normal I’m told. I don’t trust that. If I get my heart pumping too fast, I feel that sharp pain more so. I use to do 1,000 push ups, 50 to 100 reps a set. It hurts to do fifteen reps and I get winded fast. Say what they will, I know my body and something is terribly wrong.</br></br>

Yes I have informed medical many times, but their ultimate solution is lock me up in a cell and offer a few Tylenol pills. I wasn’t sentenced to be infected with a deadly virus, but CDCR will get away with murder like they get away with everything else. We’re just inmates so our lives don’t count.
