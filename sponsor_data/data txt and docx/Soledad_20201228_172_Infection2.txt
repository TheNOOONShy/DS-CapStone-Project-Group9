This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Soledad.</br></br>

A few months ago, an inmate here ended his own life. I watched them bring him outside of his cell with the material that he had used still tied around his neck. People are definitely dealing with the pandemic in different ways.</br></br> 

A lot of inmates that I worked with in the culinary tested positive for COVID-19. They have quarantine buildings for those individuals who test positive. From what I hear, a couple of them have actually had to go to outside hospitals due to underlying conditions.</br></br> 

I’ve been coping with this crisis thus far, but, I sometimes wonder, how long will it be before I have to go to an outside hospital and have a ventilator tube shoved down my throat in order to breathe? I get curious as to who’s going to be the CO or nurse to bring it into me.
