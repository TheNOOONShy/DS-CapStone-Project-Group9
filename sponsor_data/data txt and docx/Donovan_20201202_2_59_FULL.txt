This story was told by a person incarcerated at Donovan.</br></br>

Oh, this is RJ Donovan, I guess, correctional facility. The COVID situation here is fine, but we're locked down. There's not a single case on this yard, which is Echo Yard, Echo facility.</br></br>

Well, they falsified documents here to prove their case. That they're doing things, but they don't. So, I really don’t know what to say here. But the situation’s I guess okay here.
