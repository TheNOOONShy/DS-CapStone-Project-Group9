This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Soledad.</br></br>

As San Quentin exploded, during their crisis a judge ordered them to reduce that population to at least half, however that judge did not specify how to do so. Therefore San Quentin moved as many as possible to other prisons, no COVID tests or temperature checks just transfer. And if men refused they were threatened and given a rules-violation. Instead of considering their safety they gave them a definite death sentence. As those men arrived to Soledad prison the impact of the virus started little by little finding its way into housing units by medical staff who pass out medication and by prison guards.</br></br> 

Inmates were still going to work in the Furniture Factory which should have been shut down but CDCR has proven “profit over prisoner” is their motto by allowing transfers and unessential workers to go to and from in large groups with no control of the crowd.</br></br>

These unessential workers became a big part of infecting others by lack of management and believing they were more important than other inmates by giving them more privileges and less oversight. Some buildings have 50 to 70 inmate workers and one particular building has at least 150 to 200 inmate workers in it. I used to work and live among all these that's how I know.</br></br> 

So COVID testing was getting men moved around who tested positive, they were being placed in a special housing unit for isolation until the virus exploded here in Soledad CTF Central, and those inmate workers became the primary concern and all newly infected inmates were being relocated to the housing unit.</br></br>

Uninfected men were being moved out to make room for the infected. The mixing and mashing of men created more positive infections which were a deadly result once again. The warden had stated in a video address to the inmate population that “once we lose control of the virus we’ll place tents on the yard.” Those were erected about two weeks ago and now no one is allowed around those.</br></br> 

While on the yard, officers and inmates are passing away. There is a big shortage of staff and now we're not receiving canteen or quarterly packages which are sitting in a warehouse spoiling.</br></br>

Due to the shortage of staff, we might get a shower once a week, we get cell fed at around 10 am instead of 7 am like we used to. Protesters were recently outside Soledad and the prison officials gave a statement saying they were following CDC guidelines and I beg to differ. We haven't had a COVID test or temperature checks for at least two weeks and we've been to the yard twice, once on December 22nd and recently December 26th, still no testing or temperature checks, so the lack of concern and regard is once again deadly.</br></br>

There was a saying that used to say “we're in this together” but I'm trying to see who that was for? This prison’s dysfunctions need to be addressed and held accountable. As a lifer we are asked to be transparent at the parole board, why does CDCR get to manipulate the system and get away with it. Prison officials should be modeling a more honest and trustworthy system, what would happen if prisoners follow their example?</br></br> 

This is taxpayers money at work and society should be able to see how it is being used. This is not an opinion.
