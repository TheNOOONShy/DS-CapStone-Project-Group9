Dear PrisonPandemic,</br></br> 


Ok so I can’t, as you know, speak for others experiences and feelings during this pandemic, but I will say that I do know that it’s pretty close to similar in all cases, with only slight variances. Here goes. Here in the prison that I’m in we didn't officially shut down (lockdown/quarantine) until March 2020. We went from 12 - 13 hours out of our cells to 2 - 4 (if we’re lucky). Masks were officially handed out and mandated around late April 2020, after the virus had already been introduced to our environment from either a correctional officer (CO) and/or medical staff.</br></br> 


I mean think about it we are locked away from society and are essentially a petri dish. The only way the petri dish can become contaminated is from the outside. While in my eyes I view us as a vulnerable community like convalescent/retirement homes, since we can not properly social distance. We are not considered that and thus have no priority for the vaccine.</br></br> 


So in this prison here, which is not the standard build of other prisons in California, we have 14 buildings with a max capacity of 256 each and 2 more buildings make up and additional 175 bedspaces. The buildings are spread out evenly between 4 different yards (A-D) that are unable to interact with each other on a daily basis except through school and religious services, both which are not currently being provided. This prison - Valley State Prison (VSP) put bunk beds in the gym, chapel and even the arts in corrections room (all which they used), and even brought in mobile tents and showers/bathrooms onto the yard for extra bedspace (which they did not use) and emptied out one whole building on “B” yard (which is my yard) for COVID-19 positive inmates.</br></br> 


So as inmates got sick they were moved to B-4, the COVID-19 building, for 14 days and once they were released they were not sent back to their bed space of origin. Instead VSP shuffled inmates that were not sick around into bed spaces with others that were not yet sick but exposed and moved the recently recovered into the bed spaces that the non-sick inmates had just been vacated from. Why? I ask, if they had all this extra bed spaces on the facility were we constantly shuffled around? I personally was moved 7 times in the year 2020 due to quarantine protocols in place here at VSP.</br></br>

Now let's say I agree with how they handled all this shuffling around, which I don’t, why is the administration making it hard for us to go back to our yard, building and heaven forbid cell we came from. Let me explain. At VSP unlike many cell living prisons they have 8 man cells. That means I (and other individuals) have to live in a 18’x18’ cell which includes a toilet, two sinks and a shower and 4 double bunk bunkbeds. A rather paradise compared to other cell living prisons. Yet those other prison cells are only two man cells, ours are 8 man.</br></br> 


Having said that I’m sure you yourself have had problems finding a good roommate that you can get along with and can get along with you. College students deal with, what, an average 3 roommates if not less? So imagine trying to find a whole cohesive apartment, or cell in my case, of 7 other roommates. And consider this, arguments in here can and do sometimes lead to murder and or serious bodily injury unlike on the streets.</br></br> 


My point is that in almost 90% of the cases if someone is living in your cell it’s because you asked the CO’s to do what they call a convenience move (aka-bed move). So that you and any other roommate you wish can live together. This unit of people, be it a 2 man cell or 8 man, become in prison like a pseudo-family. We establish these pseudo-families as a way to protect us emotionally and mentally, sometimes even physically. Replacing the friends and family we lost due to our actions.</br></br>
