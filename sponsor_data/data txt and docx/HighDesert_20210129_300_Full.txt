I live been here at HDSP for 11 months. I transfer from New Folsom and COVID-19 pandemic been a blessing worldwide; because it brought the Black People struggle out in the open (it's a truism that what appears to be our worst nightmare often turn out to be a blessing!)</br></br> 

I am presently incarcerated at a new Jim Crow prison where these Europeans (cavedogs) rejects practice their weak ass racism and sexism and malice behavior is everyday and I call it malice in wonderful! And those weak ass racist honkies, and wetbacks cowards K9s come to work to provoke a Black man into a violent. And they only do it because they are safe; it sometimes they know deep down why they hate and fear the Black folks. And they wish they was Black!</br></br>

The hate that created hate! I deal with being incarcerated by studying Afrikan culture, literature, and writing, and exercising. And I embrace godzilla Black [redacted] priest state of mind, body, spirit, soul. And I truly believe in black power, and black steel structure, black and blue military, black and blue excellence, blue phoenix rising.</br></br>

If I were free, what would I spend my life doing? I am coming from the bottom of the street life or hood life and I am pushing a hard line with godzilla Black [redacted] priest. And bottom line I understand it's me against the world. The spirit of [redacted] life is how I find peace and harmony with myself.

Malevolent, having or showing intense ill will or hatred. Malevolence runs deep. Malevolent enemies have bitter and lasting feelings of ill will. Malevolent racism and bigotry can erupt in acts of violence against innocent people. Malevolence can also show itself in hurt words, and sometimes it can be seen in something as small as an angry look or gesture.</br></br>

Malign, to make harsh and often false or misleading statements about.</br></br>

Rebellion, open defiance and opposition, sometimes armed to a person or thing in authority.

Without the cold and desolation of winter there could not be the warmth and splendor of spring! Calamity has hardened my mind, spirit soul, body and tuned it to blue steel. Power to the people.</br></br>

Strength is being able to control yourself and your total surrounding environment, yourself first. To persevere in anything exceptional required inner strength and the unshakeable conviction that you are right!</br></br>
