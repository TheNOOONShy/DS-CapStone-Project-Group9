Dear PrisonPandemic,</br></br>                                                                                                       
 
Incarcerated Scholars Program Student Intern with Berkeley Underground Scholars, mailed me a copy of “Make Your Voice Heard” poster, encouraging contributions to the PrisonPandemic project, from people impacted by COVID-19 while in California’s carceral facilities. Please accept “Corona Confusion,” a poem I wrote to record true events, for historical preservation. Please put this poem and let the pseudonym: Prison Poet appear alongside the poem, on your website. I hope that sharing this story (in verve form) can lead to positive reform.</br></br>
 
Please, should this poem appear on your historic site, print it (as it appears online), so I may begin to heal by having a physical copy to remind me: Our voices deserved to be heard, especially in a time of madness.</br></br>
 
In solidarity,</br></br>
 
Corona Confusion (by Prison Poet)</br></br>
 
Now that we seem powerless,</br>
they eat the rulebook</br>
with all its</br>
decorative oaths.</br></br>
 
Their hands also touch.</br>
Some do more</br>
a small glance spun</br>
from eye to badge,</br>
enflamed by</br>
drunk ache in bone.</br></br>
 
Conceivable</br>
that one, that young one</br>
he pats him down,</br>
not searched</br>
that scared one, him,</br>
that one, that’s his</br>
himless scratch</br>
his daily itch</br>
made it much more penetrable.</br></br>
 
Joe K.: inmate 66</br>
“him” don’t know what to do,</br>
‘he’ took “his,”</br>
he lost it: youngster, don’t wash</br>
evidence inside</br>
while outside,</br>
with smooth efficiency,</br>
a microbe is killing</br>
more Americans,</br>
in America,</br>
than 9/11,</br>
9 times the death</br>
by 11 times the rate,</br>
and still increasing.</br></br>
 
Even Joe K. Sr.,</br>
in dismantled breaths,</br>
unmasked,</br>
ascends</br>
from the Tomb of Was.</br></br>

The LVN heard him go, silent alone</br>
survivor of 9/11: victim of COVID-19</br>
killed by a germ.</br></br>
 
That night, he arrives.</br>
The same cop,</br>
(who took his),</br>
stood outside the cell</br>
and told him: “Hey,</br>
your daddy’s dead.</br>
Corona got him.”</br></br>
 
Like a child, Joe K.,</br>
even to the eye,</br>
in words that whine</br>
and find no history,</br>
through all he felt</br>
recalcitrant & bemused,</br>
barely whinnied:</br>
“My old man don’t drink!”
