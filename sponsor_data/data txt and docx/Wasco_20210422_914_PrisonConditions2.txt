This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Wasco.</br></br>Dear PrisonPandemic,</br></br> Fortunately this letter did find me in good health, I received your letter while in the county jail. The day I got your letter, that night I got called for the bus ride to Wasco State Prison. Now as far county was going, we had no visits all we got was two five minute phone calls every Monday. Majority of the inmates did court through video.</br></br> 

The food in county jail sucks we all got sack lunches breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Cereal in the morning, then processed meat for lunch and dinner. All cold meals which is not cool. We would get three hours of dayroom and showers and phones all in one little section of the jail, then back to our cells for the next 21 hours. And we hope for good cell mates cause that's a long time to be with two other people that you just met.</br></br> 

Now let jump back real quick before we were housed in our six man cell with only two other inmates. We had to go through (quarantine) for two weeks which was 23 and a half hours lockdown, half an hour each day to shower or use the phone. Then back in the cell like a caged-up animal. Boy did that suck.</br></br> 

Then after the two weeks is up, you get housed to the six man, eight man, 60 man, and/or two man cells. Depending on your current jail status and your crimes, is how you're housed. So 60 man tanks are for people who are less likely to be trouble making, then it goes eight man, six man, two man. Then if you're a really bad guy or a "J" cat which is a crazy guy with mental issues, you are isolated 23-hour lockdown.</br></br> 

Then on top of that, deputies are some real assholes, excuse my French. So life pretty much sucks in the county, but I guess that's what happens when you don't obey the law. So, now I'm out of that dreadful place and on to a better place which is Wasco State Prison.
