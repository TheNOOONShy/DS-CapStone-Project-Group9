This story was told by a person incarcerated at Fresno County Jail.</br></br>

Caller: And people who are suicidal, which I've been before, I attempted suicide by cop, that's why I'm here, evading and - felony evading and auto theft.</br></br>

And my plan was to commit suicide by cop. It didn't happen. The cops were too - too kindhearted to kill me.</br></br>

You know, so it was very interesting. I - I really wanted to die. Anyway, it's just because I'm lonely and confused sometimes.</br></br>

The COVID you know it - it killed, you know, a couple friends of mine. And it - you know, friends that - they were the only friends that I had, you know. Even I, but you know - and - and - it was just overwhelming. So, I went off of the deep end. And it causes - it causes a lot of suffering.</br></br>

But like I told the last student that, you know, in one sense, it does devastate families, but in a different sense, it causes a lot of us to come together as humans to overcome, you know, the obstacles that we're faced with each day, you know? And you're - are you majoring in sociology?</br></br>

UCI: No, I am psychology.</br></br>

Caller: Oh, psychology. What kind - child development or?</br></br>

UCI: No, more on the behavioral side.</br></br>

Caller: Behavioral. Okay, well, I can give you some - I have 26 years incarceration. I'm 46 years old. And you know what, I don't mind giving my name because I want people to know - if I die, if I have COVID because we're in quarantine, so it's rough.</br></br>

Okay, and we're going to find out, you know?. If somebody does have it, then we have to stay in here together. With - this is what's horrible, you know?. We have to stay in here with the person, you know?.</br></br>

You know what I'm saying? There's no - There's no - we have no due process. Like how do we protect ourselves from this, you know?</br></br>

It's like - it's - everything's played by ear, even with the policy and procedure. Because there's no policy and procedure for COVID. This is all brand-new.</br></br>

So, when things happen like somebody contracts COVID, they don't - the facility isn't clear on what to do, how to protect the environment, how to protect the, you know, community, how to protect the other inmates. So, I guess they're - they're like playing it by ear, so it's - it's a hardship for all of us because.</br></br>

And I want to say something about these guards. They're purple hearts. I call 'em purple hearts. They come in here and do their duty, knowing that they can die. They can contract this.</br></br>

They are very, very beautiful people. This is what's bringing us together as inmates, okay? The psychology behind it is that they're kind hearted. They care.
