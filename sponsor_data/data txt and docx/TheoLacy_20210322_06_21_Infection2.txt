This story was told by a person incarcerated at Theo Lacy.</br></br>

UCI: That was amazing. Thank you so much for sharing that. We really do appreciate, you know, you taking the time to share your testimony.</br></br>

And I think you said it so well. That you know, my last question was going to be if you wanted anyone to know about what your experience is like, what would it be? And I think you said it perfectly.</br></br> 

Is there anything else you would like to add? I mean how is the vaccination process been going? Is it going?</br></br> 

Caller: It’s going. It’s not from. I was vaccinated because I have underlying health conditions. I know that there is no education being provided to people about the vaccines.</br></br> 

There’s a lot of conspiracy theories floating around and people have questions. And I do not, for one second, you know, feel that anybody who has questions in here shouldn’t. I mean, we have every reason to doubt anything that the sheriff does. That, you know, he claims is to benefit us.</br></br> 

Every single chance he’s had he’s tried to, you know, hurt us. He has not tried to help us. And so now him going around and saying, “Hey, look there’s a vaccine available, you guys should take it.” But we don’t trust him.</br></br> 

You know, we trust the vaccines, we don’t trust the people administering the vaccines.</br></br> 

So, I just went with my gut. I took the two shots, the pfizer shot. But, you know, there’s people that just don’t trust. People don’t trust and they’re not making a real effort to educate incarcerated individuals about the benefits of a vaccine.</br></br> 

And they even go along with conspiracy theories. You know. </br></br>

It’s definitely not going the way it should. And, again, it’s from lack of trust. When somebody has hurt you so much and somebody has taken your humanity away and to suddenly say, “Hey, trust me now.” Yeah, it doesn’t, it’s not going to work out.</br></br> 

And I think that as long as the sheriff continues to be behind the vaccination process and. Many people are going to refuse and not take the vaccine.</br></br>
