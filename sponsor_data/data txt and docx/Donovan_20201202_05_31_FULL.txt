This story was told by a person incarcerated at Donovan.</br></br>
Caller: Being away from your loved ones, not being able to see your loved ones, has been kind of hard on us here. So that’s taken a toll, being locked in the cell quite often has kinda taken a toll as well.</br></br>  UCI: What is troubling or concerning you?</br></br>Caller: What, could you repeat that?</br></br>UCI: So, you said that you’re being locked in a cell for a long time. What is troubling or concerning you?</br></br>Caller: Well, I’m concerned about my family, of course, and just the boredom and the worry that comes with it is starting to take its toll.</br></br>UCI: So how has things changed since the start of the outbreak at your facility?</br></br>Caller: We don’t get to interact with one another. We’re not being able to interact with people that’s comin’ in from the streets that run the classes or the groups. The colleges have been, you know, we’re not going to college no more so that’s kinda taken a toll on us.</br></br>UCI: Has that changed at all since the beginning of the outbreak or has that been consistent through the whole time?</br></br>Caller: That’s been over time.</br></br>UCI: Consistent over time. If possible, could you tell me how things have changed, if in any way, since things started in March?</br></br>Caller: Well, the freedom that we had, being able to mingle, get visits from our family, all that’s been taken away from us now since the start of the pandemic.</br></br>UCI: When did you start not having visits?</br></br>
Caller: In March.</br></br>UCI: In March. And is that also the last time you got to go to a class?</br></br>Caller: Yeah.</br></br>UCI: Yeah. How have you been coping with the crisis since it started?</br></br>Caller: I’m – I – I been coping with it alright, a little depressed, a little worried here and there, but overall, I’m doing alright. I’m coping with it.</br></br>UCI: What would you like people to know about your experience inside right now?</br></br>Caller: That it’s not a very good experience at all.</br></br> UCI: Can you tell me a little bit more about that?</br></br>Caller: Just the – being in prison and we already don’t have much to begin with and whatever little we did have they’ve taken away from us is making it an even worst experience.</br></br> UCI: Can you talk a little bit about the other people that you’re inside with? Is everybody okay?</br></br>Caller: They haven’t really had that many cases here, so for the most part everybody is okay right now. We’re currently on a 14-day quarantine, so the people that I’m surrounded around right now everybody is alright right now.</br></br> UCI: What do you mean you’re on a 14-day quarantine, can you explain that a little bit more to me?</br></br>Caller: Because as of right now, at first, we used to be able to get maybe two hours of recreation every day, we no longer get that now.</br></br>UCI: How much time are you having now?</br></br>Caller: None.</br></br>UCI: None. So, how much time a day do you spend in your cell?</br></br>Caller: Well, all day.</br></br>UCI: All day.</br></br>Caller: Other than when you go to shower or come out to eat and go right back in.</br></br>UCI: And how many other people are in there with you?</br></br>Caller: Six.</br></br>UCI: Six.</br></br>Caller: Including myself.</br></br>UCI: And do you feel like you’re able to safely distance from other people?</br></br>Caller: No, not at all.</br></br> UCI: What do you – what happens if somebody gets sick within your cell?</br></br>Caller: They’ll be moved to another location to where they’ll be quarantined by themselves.</br></br>UCI: By themselves. Do you know where people go?</br></br>Caller: They go to another yard and put into a cell where it’s just them.</br></br>UCI: What do you think would make the situation at your facility better?</br></br>Caller: Say that again?</br></br>UCI: What would make the situation at your facility better?</br></br>Caller: I can’t really say, I guess that come up with a cure for COVID-19.</br></br>UCI: How has the situation at your facility with COVID-19 affected your loved ones?</br></br>Caller: Oh, they’re worried as well, they’re worried about me just as much as I’m worried about them.
