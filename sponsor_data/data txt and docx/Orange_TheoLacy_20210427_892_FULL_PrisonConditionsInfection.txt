Hello,</br></br>

Thank you for your letter and your interest in the story of inmates during the COVID-19. I am offered a COVID test and vaccination two to three times per week. I choose to not be vaccinated. I do not know of any COVID-19 cases at the OCJ Theo Lacy facility where I am incarcerated.</br></br>

I do know one man who was vaccinated, and is now suffering from a blood clot in his leg. I heard this may be a side effect of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine which is used here. Fortunately, I will not be incarcerated for very long, and I may get vaccinated after I am released.</br></br>

I, along with many others, do not trust the healthcare staff here. Many mistakes and irresponsible decisions are made which seriously endangers the health of many inmates at this OCJ facility. This is supposed to be the healthcare facility. My tax dollars are not wisely spent here.</br></br>

Due to COVID-19, we are still not being served hot meals, only bologna and bread three times a day. Certainly a very unhealthy diet.</br></br>

Thank you again for your time and interest.</br></br>
