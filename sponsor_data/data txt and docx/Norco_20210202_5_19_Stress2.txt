This story was told by a person incarcerated at Norco.</br></br>If I’m being honest, not all staff. But there are some say like, “Oh well, they’re just inmates.”</br></br>And so there are a lot of people who prefer, especially some of the older guys who have underlying conditions, you know, to be just to be frank. There are guys who really talk a lot, “Well man. Am I gonna even make it home to my family?” You know.</br></br> UCI: Mhm.</br></br> Caller: And, well it’s a real concern. I just recently had my first grandson. My daughter had my first grandson six months ago.</br></br> And I, you know, it’s something that I think about, you know. I consider it. My friend who just, who tested positive a couple days ago, they moved him to another part of the prison and so I’m really, I would love to hear from him just to see how he’s doing.</br></br>I don’t, you know, we don’t know so, cause after you test positive here, they move you out of here to another place. And so we don’t, you know, we don’t know what’s going on with those other guys so, you know. I honestly don’t know. I’m just doing the best I can, you know.</br></br>Just so you know, we have free phone calls today. We’ve been getting them twice a month now, because of the corona, we’re not able to get visits so that we get free phone calls twice a month.
