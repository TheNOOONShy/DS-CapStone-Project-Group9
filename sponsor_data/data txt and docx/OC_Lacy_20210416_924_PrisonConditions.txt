The day I got arrested was Monday in the month of November. It's been three years or two since I've been arrested so I didn't know that they would be quarantined. Sorry for my misspelling. I was at Orange County Men’s Jail in Santa Ana for my booking and processing. After all that oh, they took me to Theo Lacy Jail which is in Orange where I'm currently at. So being in this pandemic, we’re supposed to be isolated from each other for 14 days give or take. We're supposed to be in the cell by ourselves but I saw in the quarantine mods/sectors that some cells had 2 people per cell. To me, it made no sense about the six feet apart rule if at the same time you have another person in the same cell. Now, remember we're in jail so every cell holds two people and the cells aren't really that big so the six feet rule really doesn't apply at all.</br></br>


Thankfully I was put by myself in a cell so everything is all cool and all days were passing by without a problem in the first 14 days of my arrest until I was tested. I came out negative which was good, the only thing is now I have to wait to get cleared by the medical staff here. The only thing is it's supposed to take one day, two the most to get cleared right after you get tested. After that you get moved to a housing mod/sector where program is running. Program is what all us inmates are looking for while we're in the quarantine mod. It's basically where we get to come out for 3 hours out of ourselves to use the phone, watch some TV, shower, and interact with others. But in the quarantine mod, we're only allowed to be outside of our cells for 30 minutes instead of 3 hours so that's why everyone in a quarantine mod is so eager to get cleared and moved to a housing mod.</br></br>
