UCI: I am listening, if you want to tell me your story.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, basically, my story from in here, during this pandemic, I mean. I guess, like at first I was kinda scared for my parents, being locked up, but overall, you know what I mean, I, you know what I mean, I guess things as it progressed, I mean, I was starting to get even more scared because my parents had caught coronavirus and I thought they were going to, they were going to die on me.</br></br> 

And I was in here, you know what I mean and I couldn’t get out, you know what I mean and that was a problem for me. And I was going through a lot at the time. But overall, they got better, thank God. And that was one of the struggles I went through in here.</br></br>

And another thing was during this pandemic, they have also, been feeding us all sack lunches, which is baloney meat and two sandwiches with baloney meat, and a pack of cookies and a fruit, three times a day. We don’t get no hot meals anymore. That’s been going on for a year in Orange County, in the Orange County jail.</br></br>

And also, I had gotten the vaccine, prior- I think on March 30th, and I just last, a couple days ago, have recovered from it. It gave me- I got the Johnson & Johnson vaccine; it gave me mad headaches, and  basically, you know what I mean. I was really going through it, especially the first night that I got the vaccine, I really went through it.</br></br>

And, that’s basically it. And if you guys have any questions for me, you know what I mean?</br></br>

UCI: So what was, or what had the vaccination situation been like at your facility? Are they trying to get everyone to have it? Are they giving you the option?</br></br>

Caller: They’re giving us options.</br></br>

UCI: Oh, that’s good.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, yeah. Any other questions?</br></br>

UCI: You mentioned, like you were nervous about the situation with your parents.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah.</br></br>

UCI: What was, the visitation stuff like? I’m guessing you weren’t able to see them or talk to them.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, yeah. There was no visits at all. Only, I was only able to see them, I mean, able to talk to them over the phone, and that’s how I was getting updates from how they were doing while they were sick.
