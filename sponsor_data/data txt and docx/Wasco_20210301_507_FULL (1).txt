Hello [Redacted],</br></br>
When I got your letter I was surprised that other people besides our families have cared or taken an interest on what’s going on to us inmates in here. I’m not going to lie to you it has been pretty stressful.</br></br>
Not only the fact that we are in here, but also a lot of changes the pandemic has caused. A quick rundown on what I’ve experienced since being here. </br></br> 
I got here in November 3rd, 2020. The longest day of your stay. Got here at about ten a.m. Went through a bunch of medical check ups plus more and finished at eight p.m. We got put in two man cell for 17 days for quarantine.</br></br>
After that I got moved to another building with two man cells, but it had a program where we could go to dayroom once a week get an hour of yard. A month after, that ended.</br></br>
People started feeling sick then the prison started testing us. An hour later we were notified that we were on lockdown and quarantine. Of course, the process on getting out of quarantine is if we all tested negative twice back to back.</br></br> 
I have been blessed to testing negative on every test. We stayed on quarantine for about what seemed a month and a half to two months. So two months of no freedom (no dayroom and yard).</br></br>
We were stuck in our cells 24/7. We only got out to grab our trays in the morning and at night. Also if you took meds. Meds changed between the nurses coming to our cell and slide the little paper cup of pills under the door or through the side of the door, or they came into the building with a cart and inmates would be let out.</br></br>
We had been on and off quarantine for another month and week. We still got to use the phone twice a week, but that got cut down to once a week, then it was more of a hit and miss. Anyways, this pandemic has done a lot to us.</br></br>
From what I’ve been told by other inmates. Some have been here for a year because of the pandemic, some have stayed here because the prison they were endorsed to shut down. Not only what’s been going in here is stressful.</br></br>
The cancellation of visits has been pretty bad. I was in county when all visits were cancelled. I had to adjust to not seeing my parents and my girlfriend every weekend.</br></br>
Obviously, I can call them but, we all know it not the same. I had to spend almost a year not seeing my girlfriend. My parents I haven’t seen them because they are not technologically savvy. But seeing one is better than none.</br></br>
So far that’s been my experience here in CDCR. It seems like I’ve been here for a lot longer than what I’ve been doing. I hope this helps you and others understand what we been dealing with specially because of our mistakes. I hope you have a blessed day.</br></br>
Thank you for caring.
