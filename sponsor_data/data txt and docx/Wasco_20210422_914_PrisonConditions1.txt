This letter was written by someone incarcerated at Wasco.</br></br>

Just like in county, we do two weeks of quarantine which is not bad cause I have a good cell mate. We give each other positive affirmations, and have great conversations on how to better our lives upon our return to society. Now in prison we get breakfast hot meal sacks for lunch and hot dinner, way better than county. We get temperature checks every day, COVID swabs every week, we get showers every other day, and a 15-minute free phone once a week.</br></br> 

Plus the correctional officers are way more respectful, they don't call you foul names or try and push their weight around. They understand that we are all grown men. Yeah we made mistakes but people are subject to change. They don't belittle us inmates as county deputies do. Well today is April 21, 2021. I've been in quarantine for eight days with six more to go, then we will be housed in a dorm setting.</br></br> 

Fortunately I'm not a trouble maker so I'll be housed in the hundred man dorms with a strict 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. program. We get movies, showers, pinochle tournaments at which I'm fairly good at. So before I start to end this letter I'll jump back to county, where I got my Johnson & Johnson vaccine shot and my lil card that says I've been vaccinated on April 8, 2021, and swabbed every week in county, but prison is way better in terms of comfort and safety.</br></br> 

So on another note, it is good to know someone cares about us inmates, cause just because we're in jail or prison, doesn't necessarily mean we're bad people. As for me every day is a learning process. I try to better my thoughts and actions so I can be a productive member in society. So by the time you get this letter and write back, which I hope you do, I should be in the dorms, and I could let you know how my living situations are.</br></br> 

So I would love to hear a lil about who you are. What is life like out there on your side of town? Is the food good? How's college? Is it fun? So I'm gonna end this letter, how you started yours, which is I hope it reaches you in good health. Life can be struggle but we have to learn how to cope with it and push forward. Best wishes to you and yours from me and mine.</br></br>

P.S. I'm enclosing a copy of my vaccination record card for our historical purposes. P.S.S. Don't be a stranger, I would love to hear from you just as you want to hear about me. Sorry for the sloppy writing, these golf pencils are so short and hard to write with.
