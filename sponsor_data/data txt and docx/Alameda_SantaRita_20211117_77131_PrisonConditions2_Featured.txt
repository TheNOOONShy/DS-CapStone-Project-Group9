This story was told by a person incarcerated at Santa Rita Jail.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, how have you been coping with the crisis?</br></br>

Caller: Oh, I’ve been, I’ve been dealing it with the best I can but not like everyone else. I’m a little bit more harassed because of my criminal court case proceeding situation than a lot of others. So, mine is a bit, I can’t really speak for everyone else. My experience is a lot different from a lot of other people.</br></br>

Because I’ve been kind of targeted, more so than anyone else. But, because I won't plead guilty to the case and let them invade severe civil liabilities. And it’s not just my liability of what they would have to pay me and the civil litigations, but all of those who have been violated within the last 30 years behind it. You know what I mean?</br></br>

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: So the stakes are really really high for me because I would be the president case on a domino effect. You kind of get my drift?</br></br>

UCI: Yeah. I get it.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah. So, yeah. It’s been kind of rough. Like, I’ve been on a hunger strike for lengthy 30 days. I’ve lost over 37 pounds. And, one time, it got so bad, I went from 8 pounds, I lost 8 pounds in just one week. Due to, before I was really prescribed Ensure supplements, three times a day. They retaliated on me by saying that they’re out of stock of Ensure for four days straight.</br></br>

Lying, trying to retaliate secretly against me, behind this whole situation that I am enduring right now. But luckily, I’ve had the [redacted] to try to stick up for me on a lot of different issues like calling up here, contacting my public defender, trying to get him to call them, or sit down and have a meeting about why am I being court-ordered to [redacted]. They reviewed the documents, they saw that it was a lot of illegalities and issues with how it was done and he’s refusing to meet with them.</br></br>

So they’re now having a meeting on it tonight on how to proceed with me and a couple of, maybe a chosen few others if they have really severely been violated in this county jail here. They just got sued and lost.</br></br>

The [redacted] versus [redacted] county. Case number [redacted]. Yeah, they’re, they just lost that and they’re in a settlement agreement with [redacted], to get 250 more deputies so they can accommodate the mental health but all they’re gonna do is train 250 more deputies to be more criminally abusive towards the mental health.</br></br>

That’s all they’ll do when they receive the money. So, we’re objecting to the preliminary approval of consent decree. For them to get anything, we need to downsize the jail by letting the population be emptied or lessened. We don’t need any more abusive criminal activity to conspire any further.</br></br>

'Cause they’re just gonna take the money and then further violate our rights 'cause they’re still doing it and they haven’t even been given the money yet. They have until this [redacted], and then [redacted] is the final date for them to start receiving the federal funding. But, we’re objecting. We have up until [redacted] to object.
