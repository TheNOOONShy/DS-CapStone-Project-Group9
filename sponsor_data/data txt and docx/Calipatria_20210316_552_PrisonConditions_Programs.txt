This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Calipatria.</br></br>When I received your letter, I had just finished working out and was about to start on my college work. I’m enrolled in college. Mathematical statistics (intro), love it. Interesting stuff.</br></br>I’m one of the lucky few (blessed, really) to have the ability to leave the cell because I was granted the opportunity to draw a mural of 680 ft. squared on the yard's gym wall. So, I get to go out about four and a half days out of the week to paint.</br></br>It’s an experience, since I had never picked up a paint brush before but am very confident on the talent’s God has put in me. The faculty captain granted me pretty much total freedom over this project. None of this is common to prisoners.</br></br>They allowed me artistic freedom, pick who I wanted to help me with the project (only two of the five remain, they (three) were let go to protect the integrity of the project), work hours, an amazing amount of supplies with paint. In short, it is something we are privileged to do because we are being allowed to live out our potential.</br></br>For us, it is not about leaving the cell (after your initial year or two, you adapt your entire life to cell, everything essential to us is in here. A cell that’s about 6’x12’, but the actual space we have to move about in is about 2.5 feet wide by 10 or 9 feet long without running into a locker, bunk, desk, toilet, or wall), it is the opportunity to do something productive and worthy of admiration, praise, community, rehabilitation.</br></br>The entire thing of how all this happened is a story in itself, right as the pandemic was coming out of Wuhan, China. Truth is every day is a story in my life. No day is uneventful. Just as I am here, right now in this moment with you, I am always an open book.</br></br>Things under this pandemic are far worse for some of my peers here, or people out there. I can’t give you horror stories, unless it is a horror story. But I’m a go getter, happy-go-lucky, worries don’t benefit me or those around me. I just go. None of this is difficult to me.
