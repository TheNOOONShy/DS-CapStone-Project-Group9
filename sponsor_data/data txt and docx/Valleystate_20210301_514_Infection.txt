This letter was written by an individual incarcerated at Valley State. </br></br>I tested positive for COVID-19 approx. 120 days ago. I only knew this because I have been testing again every Monday since my “90 days of immunity” have run out. </br></br> I moved five times within the 90 days. Sick or well the CO’s bring you a handful of bags and tell you to “pack up, you’re moving!” To refuse is a 115 write up for refusing and most likely you’ll still be moving. </br></br>With prior knowledge of this aversive move- punishment, people start to refuse the COVID test. Whole cells would rather quarantine in place with people they feel safe living around. </br></br>The Assistant Warden comes to our building C1 to tell us that if we refuse the test we go to Administrative Housing Unit to quarantine anyway but with a write-up for refusal to test. Write-ups remove your “good time credits” which ultimately keeps you inside prison longer. </br></br>As two of my cellies test positive and the officers have them pack up and they move them to a building with other positive tested inmates. We are told to pack up and wait for instructions. About ten or 11 p.m. they move us to Ad-seg cells to await evaluation which consisted of temperature checks three times a day. </br></br>Isolation with showers every other day. Two days later I start to feel sick but I’m not positive if it is COVID symptoms or withdraw from them missing my depression medicine for the past two days. The end of the second day during medication call they have me kicking my door to not miss my medication for a third time in a row. </br></br>At this time, I am sick, shivering with cold sweats, and my lungs hurt. I know it is COVID by the pain in my breathing. That night when the medical staff came around checking temperatures I ask what my temperature was, and she tells me it is a little high probably because I’m wearing sweats and sweater. I told her no! I’m wearing this because I am freezing and sick. </br></br>
I wanted to know at what temperature do they do something and I could not get an answer. I felt powerless. The recommendation was drink plenty of water. I realized that temperature checks were only a formality. </br></br>
