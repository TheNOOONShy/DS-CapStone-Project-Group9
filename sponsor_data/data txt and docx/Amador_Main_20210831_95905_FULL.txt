This story was told by a person incarcerated at Amador County Jail.</br></br>

UCI: Please, tell me your COVID story by beginning what facility are you currently housed at?

Caller: I'm currently housed at Amador County Jail.</br></br>

UCI: Awesome.</br></br>

Caller: And then, it's terrible in here, man, you know.</br></br>

UCI: Dude, I've been hearing nothing but that. Please, tell me, like, what's going on. Like.</br></br>

Caller: Like, they take away our visits. We have no visits. We can't even see our people, you know. They try to say that they're giving these tablets, and they've been giving these tablets for years, and not one of us have gotten no tablets. That way we can't visit our people or talk to our people, you know.</br></br>

We can't even go outside and have sunlight, you know. They got this tent on our yard that hasn't had one inmate there that had COVID the whole time. They bring people that have COVID into this jail and they say that – they don't test them or nothing.</br></br>

They bring them in here and they say it's for the tent, that that's where people are supposed to go, you know. So, we got to sit here and stress over COVID. And the fact that we can't talk to our children and see our loved ones, you know, it's just a terrible thing. And when we try to grieve it or fight it they go against us, you know.</br></br>

There's, it's not - there's a couple of officers that are actually really, really alright, you know. But, it's just been a real messed up experience and stressful experience for all of us.</br></br>

UCI: Hey, thank you for sharing at least that much with me, I really appreciate it.</br></br>

Caller: Sure, yes, sir. So, I guess that's it. Our families are going through it just as bad. Our families tries to call up here. Our families try to call up here and they get the runaround, you know. They - everything is just a - everything's all a runaround, a runaround.</br></br>

Our family puts money - our families put money into these tablets so we could get these tablets and we can't even get tablets so we can see our children, you know. My son is – I've spent my whole life incarcerated, well, pretty much, and my son, I've been in prison the whole time. And, you know, he's 20 years old, I spent almost 20 years of his life behind bars.</br></br>

At least I would have been able to visit him before, prior COVID. But, due to COVID I can't - I can't see nobody, you know. I can't.</br></br>

You know, and then they shut down the front office here so that way our people can't even come in and put money on our account, you know. So, I can't even - I can't even get money for a phone call, you know, to call my people. And it's not just me, there's numerous people that are going through that.</br></br>

And that's all I wanted to share with you guys. Thank you guys very much.</br></br>

UCI: Oh, my god, you are not alone, sir. I have been hearing that story from so many people, and I just really appreciate you calling to share that. That's not right. And thank you.</br></br>

You calling, you sharing your story right now is the reason that we are doing this project. And that's just it. We're going to make sure that your story gets on our repository. It will be on our website, you will be able to see it.</br></br>

Caller: All right, thank you.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, of course.</br></br>

Caller: Appreciate it. I hope you have a good day. And, you know, I hope this gets out there and people get to hear it. Especially because of this county. This county is the worst I've ever been in, in my life.</br></br>

UCI: You know, UCI, this project is paying for any and all phone calls. Did you have to pay for today's phone call?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, I'm paying for this phone call right now.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, you should not be - you should not have to pay for any and all phone calls. Thank you for letting me know. I will be letting our project know and we will be making sure to start the process to remedy that back. And you can let your cohorts know as well, that they should be able to call this project, this hotline, and not have to pay for the phone call.</br></br>

Caller: All right, thank you, I appreciate that.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, so, I'll be making sure to file that for you.</br></br>

Caller: Cool, thank you. I'm going to let you go though, with that.</br></br>

UCI: Okay, thank you, sir.</br></br>

Caller: Alright, thank you, have a good day.</br></br>

UCI: You too, bye-bye.</br></br>

Caller: Bye.
