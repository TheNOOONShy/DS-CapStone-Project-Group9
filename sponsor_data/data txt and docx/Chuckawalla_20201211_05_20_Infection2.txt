This story was told by a person incarcerated at Chuckawalla.</br></br>

UCI: What would you most want people to know about your experience in these past couple months?</br></br>Caller: Is that, when I became positive. Okay. I was negative maybe five times after taking the nose, the thing down your nose right. I was maybe negative five times. And then all of a sudden I popped up positive.</br></br> 

They sent me out of here, over to another building where everybody else was positive and had pneumonia. Okay. Two days later, I passed out. Okay. On-</br></br>I passed out and they take me by 911 emergency over to the hospital, to the main hospital. Okay. And what I want everybody to know is that there are so many inmates here going to that hospital, and being treated. I mean I would want to say the best they can, but there's just too many of us in this situation.</br></br>But for me, when I got over there, they had to do a CAT scan of my brain and my chest. Come to find out, that not only was I COVID positive, but I had COVID pneumonia in my chest. Okay. I was dehydrated.</br></br> 

And because I was taking blood pressure medication, the doctor told me that was a "cocktail for disaster. And that’s why you passed out and we had to get you down so quick. Because you had a seizure like episode" and I never had seizures in my life. You know?</br></br>So it’s just, being in here in these circumstances is not a good thing with this pandemic as far as I’m concerned. I want people to know because I don’t know what else can be done except for moving people. You know. We have to minimize the numbers in order to practice social distancing, in order to be safe.</br></br> 

And there’s no way to do, with this many people in the building.
