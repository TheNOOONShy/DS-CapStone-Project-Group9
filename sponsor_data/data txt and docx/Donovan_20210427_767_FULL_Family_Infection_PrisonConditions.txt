Dear PrisonPandemic,</br></br>

I hope this letter finds you in good health! I received your letter and I was very surprised to hear from you. Let me tell you a little about myself. I been locked up since 1993 for murder/attempt of murder. I was 18 years old when I got arrested?</br></br>

It’s been hard for me. I been through a lot. I almost got killed in a prison riot. I got shot in the back. I’ve also been stabbed multiple times.</br></br> 

Prison is very dangerous places to be. I’m scare, but I have to tough it out in order to survive?</br></br>

Here’s the good thing about my whole situation; my case was picked up by the Innocent project and the DA witness recanted her story stating she had lied about me. I have a chance to go back to court and prove I had nothing to do with the life crime. I’m totally innocent of the life crime I was convicted of. Wish me the best?</br></br> 

I’m hoping all goes well for me.</br></br>

Now, about COVID-19 here in the prison. Well, I’ve taken the Pfizer shots and we still don’t have no visits. It’s been two years and one month with no visits. I believe this weekend we should have visiting for half an hour.</br></br> 

Inmates died here in RJD due to the COVID-19. I lost a good friend due to the COVID-19. It’s hard to not see family, only talk to them on the phone & through letters. In order to have a visit, your family members have to have proof of vaccination.</br></br>

My mother/father will not take the shot? They are against that. The facility here in RJD had us separately from other buildings. We would only come out one building out at a time to yard.</br></br> 

Now, we have full program since SD is on the orange tier. Whatever happens in SD affects us in here.</br></br> 

We get tested very often to make sure we don’t have the COVID-19. Once you test and if you test positive, you get moved to another facility and they monitor you for the next 14 days. They check your temperature for the next 14 days.</br></br>
 
Well, I guess that’s all for now. I hope that my story has given you what you needed to know. Thank you for writing and I wish you guys the best.</br></br>

Sincerely.
