This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Kern Valley.</br></br>
Dear PrisonPandemic Team,</br></br>
I received your short message. I pray that this letter finds you in the very best of health as well as spirits? Yeah, you were right, these are definitely difficult times for everyone. Keep your mask on out there and stay up on washing your hands, even if you took the vaccine okay?</br></br>
Look, how are you dealing with this if you don’t mind me asking? From the very beginning, I have been kind of stressed out! My little cousin just had COVID-19. She shook it off in like one week, thank God! I think I caught and shook it off myself. Again, I must say thank God. I had all the symptoms.</br></br>
My taste, smell, high fever, and all of that! For like three days my Celly had it too. He had it for two days, and a few of my associates here caught it as well. They got over it also, thank God!</br></br>
I am a part of an association that is located in Oakland California. They advised me to file a Right of Habeas Corpus under the fact that CDCR Cannot avoid me from catching COVID-19 and I could possibly die if I catch it! And I wasn’t sentenced to death, you feel me? I also requested for the court to release me, and to grant me A temporary restraining order and eventually hearing. I am currently in the appeals court with it right now, the Superior Court out here denied my right, so that is where I am at with that.</br></br>
I want to thank you for saying in your letter, that you know I have what it takes to get through all of this all right. And I say this in an honest way. Because I have been locked up for 14 years. You know you looked me up, but you also stated that you may not know me personally.</br></br>
But you would like me to know that people are thinking about me and hoping I get through this challenge. You found my name on the public list on CDCR website. On the good Big Man above, all that touched my emotions. I say this without you thinking that I am trying to come onto you.</br></br>
Just to bring to your attention, it is a beautiful thing that you were attending college and part of the UCI. You are doing your thing out there in life. If you don’t mind? I would like to know, how old are you? Since you know a lot about me. You all are out there pushing for us that are incarcerated. That is a very beautiful thing, and I must say that I surround myself with the same mind, thinking pattern, and goals as I do.</br></br>
So I pray that we continue to keep a strong line of communication from this day on. As associates, if nothing else, I need good advice sometimes. Or a letter of encouragement like the one you sent me!</br></br>
Nothing in our life happens on the strength or just because, everything happens for a reason. It's just up to us to figure out what that reason means. Like out of thousands of names on that public list on CDCR’s website, you picked mine!</br></br>
What are the odds of that happening? Either I am a very lucky man, which I’m not, (look where I’m at!) or what? I don’t know. However, enjoy the rest of your day. I am not going to bore you any longer. I hope to hear from you very soon.</br></br>
Sincerely,
