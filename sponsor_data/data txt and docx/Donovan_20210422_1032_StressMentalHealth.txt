This story was told by a person incarcerated at Donovan.</br></br>Caller: Well, right now, man, there's these people that are cutting themselves and committing suicide man and people that are walking around here are depressed people that have never, I mean, there's some guys that have gotten used to being in isolation or guys have done shoe terms and are mentally capable of dealing with these kinds of things. But a lot of the population is not strong enough to deal with that not having anyone to talk to, not having groups not having, it's like people are not able to to rehabilitate right now like on their own. A lot of guys need help to do that, they need guidance, and they're sitting here not able to receive this help.</br></br>Caller: And some guys are gonna get out soon, you know, and those are gonna be guys that are in the community, it might be your neighbor, you know, and they're sitting here, not able to get the help that they need. So that's very concerning, you know, I'm getting out this year, possibly, in December. And, you know, I know that that guys really need a lot of help, that are going home and they're not able to get it right now, thankfully, I've been participating in and recovery for years now over a decade, and I'm ready to get out and be a good neighbor to everybody, anyone that I live next to, but there's a lot of guys that need help here, man, and they're not getting it. Because the COVID and people are breaking down mentally, because they don't have anything going on with their with their program right now.</br></br>Caller: I mean, they give packets, but it doesn't really, it's not the same as being able to go to a group and interact with, with volunteers and staff and having a facilitator break down steps to them and and do these things within that are normally done.</br></br>UCI: Right! No, that's Yeah, that's what we've been hearing. Is there anything that you can think of that can make things at your facility better? Caller: Well, if we were able to have groups, even at a limited capacity, that would be a good start, I think. And then staff come in here every day, as far as the guards, so I don't see whyvolunteers can’t get tested and come in as well. So that at least the people that are breaking down mentally, right now would be able to, to have something positive like that intheir day, instead of just being stuck in their cell. Trying to go through a packet, you know. So being able to have some groups back, that would definitely be a big help to the facility, in my opinion.</br></br>
