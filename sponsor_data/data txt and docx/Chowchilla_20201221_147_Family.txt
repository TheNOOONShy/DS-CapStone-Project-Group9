The only thing that sucks was having our visits taken away. I usually see my dad every three months or so. We had a visit in January then, COVID struck. About two weeks ago they finally set up video visits. </br></br> 

I finally got to see my dad 11 months later. It was nice. I got to see the new house, my cat, and my stepmom.</br></br> 

At least they gave us some way we can see our loved ones. I've been coping with this crisis by calling my family members to check on them, praying, and just putting positive vibes out into the universe.
