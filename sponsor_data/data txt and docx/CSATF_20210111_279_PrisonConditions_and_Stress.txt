I don't feel safe. The cops here were reckless when it came to protecting me from this virus. They don't clean as much as they're supposed to. There ain't much social distancing.</br></br>

And the cops don't be wearing their mask, and they're the main people coming in and out of this prison.</br></br>

Visitation, my wife and I came to an understanding, it's not that serious. It's not worth being around too many people and catching the virus, so we're not taking no chances.</br></br>

But it's hard being in prison. Constantly having to watch your back. You have a lot of people here that don't care on going home, or don't have anyone. No family, loved ones, so you have to pick and choose to hang around with.</br></br> 

You got rapists, murderers, drug dealers, etc. I stay away from all. I don't have no friends in this place, and I'm fine with that. I didn't come to prison to make friends, I came here to do my time.</br></br>

But the only person I take advice from is my wife, and she keeps me positive and daily lets me know this place is temporary. Hearing my wife's voice gives me strength every day to be a better man, and had taught me not to take things for granted, and I don't. I've realized this life isn't for me. My best day in prison don't compare to my worst day in society!</br></br> 

I rather live in misery in society than live good and have everything in prison, cause at the end of the day, I'm alone.</br></br>

I don't have anyone that loves me here. I keep myself warm at night in my bed, and it's lonely. It's very depressing behind these walls. I hate it here, but I knew the outcome when I committed my crime.</br></br> 

But my wife keeps me going. Her voice matters, and without her in my life, I make stupid decisions, and I know I'm better than that. I value myself now, it took me 25 years, but now I value myself.
