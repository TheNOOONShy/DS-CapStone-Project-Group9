Greetings PrisonPandemic,</br></br>


I hope this letter finds you well, especially given everything going on in the world right now with COVID-19. Thank you for your small note that is undated to me, however post dated March 2021.</br></br>


Now to answer your questions, it was over 300 prisoners here at CHCF who had the COVID-19, with only 15 deaths. However, many CHCF staff members had COVID-19 and many died. Cannot give you the number of staff who died. Now big problem here at CHCF, CDCR medical officials do not give the prisoners a new mask to wear every week. Sometimes the prisoners may get a new mask to wear after 30 days, etc.</br></br>


However, I must say that myself and all the prisoners in facility [redacted], we are the only unit who has not got COVID-19 out of 3000 prisoners. All I can say is the doctor in [redacted] is doing something right. Even if we as prisoners are not given a new mask to wear everyday.</br></br>


However, I do want you to know that all the staff here at CHCF is given a new mask everyday to wear. Also please note the food that the prisoners are given to eat here is real bad and overcooked, etc. The clothes the prisoners are given are not clean, etc. Just real bad. Please let me know if you want more information about CHCF.</br></br>


However, I will say that I was safe so far when it comes to COVID-19. Thank you for writing to me and I will look forward to hear from you.</br></br>


So I will close for now. I do thank you very much. I will be writing more soon. Take care and be safe with goodness.</br></br>


Sincerely unity and respect always, from comrade.
