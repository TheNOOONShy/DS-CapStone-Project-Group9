This letter was written by a person incarcerated at High Desert.</br></br>

To those there at the PrisonPandemic project. I'm currently located at High Desert State Prison. I've recently received a letter about a couple of days asking to know my story of what's happening inside this institution. So I hope this letter finds those in good spirits out there.</br></br>

Well my story goes like this, I got in some trouble in my early 20s, 21 to be current, but I came to HDSP in the year of 2017 and been up here ever since. This has to be one of the worst prisons in America. They say that this was one of the most dangerous prisons in California but some of that change since they put the cameras up.</br></br> 

But it's always their words that rule over a lot of thing big are small.</br></br>

And I've been up here for five to six years and it's hard to get from up here because like the COs say "keep us here makes their small town thrive."</br></br> 

And believe me I never ask to come up here and I've been trying to leave here but it's like we're all trapped in a maze. The only places we get transferred to us is yard to yard.</br></br>

Did you guys know that here at HDSP they had a sign on the prison gate saying "Here this place is like a hotel, people here check out unless it's a body bag". That must have scared me, I was only 21 and never been to prison.</br></br> 

I was still a child within my mind. All I was heard about this place was bad stories of how dangerous and corrupt this place was.</br></br>

I would like for you to feel how misplace I must have felt, it wasn't good. Many people would express so much negative about this one prison and I also took this initiative to post this letter so other can give you their stories also.</br></br> 

Most of us know that we made bad decision and choices that we trying to fix and give back daily but it's hard when you're in this negative prison.</br></br>

And most people thinks that prison isn't suppose to be candy land, or be a positive place. But there is a good institutions that offer many good things but here just makes my life harder. They don't believe in real rehabilitation.</br></br> 

Of course they have some GL groups but it's wack, because they rarely run them and I'm talking before the pandemic. There's always excuses why they're not giving us the things we're entitled to and etc.</br></br>

Ever since the COVID crisis came to this prison they mishandled it and it led to many deaths. The very first death I remember is one of my friends that battled with breathing problems. And they denied his medical attention when he was suffering to breathe one day.</br></br> 

So we walk to the medical hall and they denied him. And as he was making his way back to his housing building and collapsed right there. And that was the last time I've seen him before his life was stolen because they didn't want to take a time out to see what was going on with this person.</br></br>

They mishandled helping him, he could have still been there. They only released about under a 100 prisoners due to COVID-19 but they didn't stop the spread of COVID-19. Because they were bringing other prisoners from San Quentin where it was a major breakout there and other prisons as well.</br></br> 

And that's when half of the yard I'm in got infected with the disease.</br></br>

I've been impacted by the pandemic because I've haven't been able to get any proper medical attention. To see a doctor about my health, for my eyes, the bullet in my neck, or my back pain, and also my dental health. They don't- they hadn't even attempted to make certain thing available to us hurt at HDSP.</br></br>

The only thing they really get going on is mental health and they stay trying to put everyone on psych medication around here. But yeah I'm really affected because I don't get to do anything that can further my release date that is only Christmas day this year.</br></br>

But it's so easy to get into some trouble to further extend your release as trouble just met me. It's not one good thing anybody here at HDSP would tell you they enjoy here at this prison.</br></br>

The COs brought the virus here and they went around trying to say inmates were the cause for it being here. Without being anything positive to do, people have been getting into fights, stabbing, and substance abuse. Not being able to see our families and loved ones have been a big distress to me and to my family.</br></br> 

Being in this place while a pandemic is going on, with me being so close to home, makes me feel like it's a constant death threat. That's waiting to check me out like that sign I told you guys about.</br></br>

And that's very stressful, not knowing if I'm going to make it home to my family. I don't feel safe at all in here with this virus or with these corrupt COs. It's been hard to try to be positive. And I'm pretty sure a positive guy. I don't be going out getting into trouble.</br></br>

It's been so stressful on all incarcerated individuals. Some of us have to do things we knew we shouldn't do to survive these hard times. Things that will delay release dates, so yeah it's been a real drought on things around these parts.</br></br> 

Some new reforms need to be seriously made to help all incarcerated people no matter the crimes or conditions of crimes. How can we be incarcerated for our crimes that's not sentence to life sentences and end up getting life sentences because of our bondage that wasn't sentence to death?</br></br>

Thank you for taking time to listen to my story about our trials here at High Desert State Prison. And I say our trials because I speak on behalf of us here at HDSP, the voice or the voices.</br></br>

P.S. Sincerely</br></br>

Feel free to let me know if you received my mail so I can know my mail wasn't tampered with. Please and thank you for publishing my short story. I'll be waiting to hear something back.
