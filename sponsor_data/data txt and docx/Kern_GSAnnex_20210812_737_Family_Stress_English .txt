This story was told by a person incarcerated at an ICE/Private-Contractor facility.</br></br>

Caller: Well, it's very complicated. The only thing a person must keep in mind is to respect, to know very well what the guidelines are to avoid contagion.</br></br> 

UCI: Yes.</br></br>

Caller: And to distance yourself and help yourself. How? By quickly notifying the people who can care for that person. I am not ready to teach anyone, only to inform what is happening with someone or myself. It could be that-</br></br> 

UCI: Wow.</br></br>

Caller: -the day in which a person can pass through this for the first time, is also complicated.</br></br>

One doesn't want to have this disease, but at a distance, by telephone, families who want to know what is happening present another problem. One has to say "Well, run to the hospital-</br></br>

UCI: Impossible.</br></br>

Caller: -to the doctors."  Someone else says, " No. Don't go because you'll die there." So, then, what happens then? You yourself are deciding.</br></br>

UCI: Good. Good.</br></br>

Caller: That is what I think is the best, encourage them to express all the symptoms and that you love life and keep trying to deal with this disease. And that is the way you can best fight with this pandemic.</br></br>

UCI: Wow. I can't believe your story.</br></br>

Caller: Well, here we are as we continue sharing.</br></br>

UCI: I don't know what to say.</br></br>

Caller: You know what? Pardon my observation, but sometimes you don't even have to go through this illness. Being a humanitarian by watching close up. That is what breaks things and by alerting one another to avoid the expansion of this pandemic.
