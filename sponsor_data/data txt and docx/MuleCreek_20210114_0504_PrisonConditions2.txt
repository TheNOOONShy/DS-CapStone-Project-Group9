This story was told by a person incarcerated at Mule Creek.</br></br>

Caller: A lot of times the staff here don’t wear their masks, but then they force everybody else to wear masks. They force people to work. It don’t matter if they can or can’t. Yeah I mean a lot of it’s just unnecessary stuff that can be fixed and done the right way. They just choose not to do it.</br></br> UCI: So with what’s happening now, was it different in the beginning of the pandemic or is it sort of like the same all throughout since March of last year, the way that these things have been happening?</br></br>Caller: Well in the beginning they were kinda like, they had more of a handle on it and they were doing things more, the correct way. But now since they're doin’ whatever they want, they’re gettin’ tired of dealing with it, they getting tired of dealing with it like it's the inmates' faults that we have COVID. But we didn’t get it until a staff brought it in to us, ‘cause we’re in a secluded area, so.
