This story was told by a person incarcerated at Monterey County Jail.</br></br>

UCI: Okay. Umm yes and umm you wanted to share a story about the COVID?</br></br>

Caller: Okay, ma'am, [unintelligible]. First, we need in county monitoring for pain on our arms where the police hurt my right arm after two months. For three weeks I was given local pain killer, Ibuprofen, for a fractured arm.</br></br>

Yes, it did as the first staff. And the medical staff is  [unintelligible] schizophrenia term. So, I need a psychologist. I have been [unintelligible] down but the Monterey police [unintelligible], and all my rights have been denied.</br></br>

The nurse in particular is not available for five weeks at a time. You wait 90 days to go to court, and justice is not that fast either. You wait five weeks to see the nurse, 90 days to go to court.</br></br>

No fire, no bail, or no bail set at $150,000. Then you receive Section 1369 and bail is taken away and a program is denied. And then, your mentally ill records are nowhere to be found and you're not even offered a program.</br></br>

And ten years ago you were here on a misdemeanor charge and they're saying since you have a strike they're going to use that against you and give you 13 years. Here in Monterey county, justice did not serve the staff around the union of the United States.</br></br>

I have witnessed justice  people of Monterey County turning a lot quicker of the inmate [unintelligible] or [unintelligible] are not equal because two times for a new crime and back here for a crime I done but is not the same crime. I am so eligible for a program, mental health case, like Monterey justice attorney only making up the rules as the women and men are caught. I have no assault record, I'm back behind barbed wire here in Monterey. I have stepped back 50 years into the past of USA.</br></br>

Now, the nurse [unintelligible], you look at her in eyes and you tell her you can't breathe and you have some, what's it called, buggers and mucus in your nose that's hardening and it's bloody, and she looks at you like [unintelligible] in your [unintelligible]. That's how cold and uncaring the PRN justice is. And I would appreciate it if I could be compensated something for maybe a bar of soap or a bottle of shampoo or something like that.</br></br>

And justice is so tiring. And, you know, you can't get out of your pod, you stay in there 24 hours a day. And then they did down visiting up here. I just got back here, I don't know what the farm people are making up.</br></br>

[Unintelligible] because they're all a bunch of farmers trying to run a city.</br></br>

UCI: Okay, thank you so much for calling and sharing your story. Was that all at this time that you would like to say?</br></br>

Caller: You know, the pandemic's going on and, you know, the doctor acts as though she wants to have sex and intercourse and have the guards watching. So, anyway, and don't be pregnant because they're going to tell you you're not. And you know your body better than they do, but they're going to tell you, you can't be pregnant because you're old.</br></br>

What did god ever tell you in the Bible, one thing, as long as you're a woman you're going to bear children.
