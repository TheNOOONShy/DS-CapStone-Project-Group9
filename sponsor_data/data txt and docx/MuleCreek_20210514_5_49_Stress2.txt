This story was told by a person incarcerated at Mule Creek.</br></br>

UCI: Yes. And excuse me, I don’t remember.</br></br>

Caller: It seems to me that I have already told you a lot.</br></br>

UCI: Excuse me, I don’t remember if I already asked you what prison you’re at?</br><br?

Caller: Oh, I’m in the Mule Creek prison. In Ione, California. It’s towards the north of California.</br></br>

UCI: Thank you so much for calling us today too.</br></br>

Caller: Yes. I have many things that I can say. That I can tell you about here. And well I know that you don’t, maybe it’s a project of yours that you just have right there. And no, maybe they won’t let you write the people who are here and try to find out a little more about the situation here.</br></br> 

But I think that there would be nothing wrong if someone would write to some of you and let you know more or less the things that are happening here and things like that. Do you understand me, there’s no interest it’s just a friendship, just a friendship on the outside. Try to talk about the things that one is going through in here. I do need someone with whom to write, someone who answers me and tell them about these things.</br></br> 

Can I call you again?</br></br>

UCI: Yes. You can call me. And you can always write too. And now I think they are writing back too. But I don’t know how it takes to receive that.</br></br>

Caller: Oh. Okay. Do you want me to call you another little bit? And keep talking?</br></br>

UCI: If you’d like. If you’d like.</br></br>

Caller: Yes. Okay, I want to talk to you a little more about this. Right now I’ll call you okay?</br></br>

UCI: Okay.</br></br>

Caller: Okay, bye.</br></br>

UCI: Okay, okay. Thank you.
