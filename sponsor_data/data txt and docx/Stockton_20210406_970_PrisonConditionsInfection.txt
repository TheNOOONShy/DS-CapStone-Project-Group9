This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Stockton</br></br>In here, many of the staff were beginning to test positive and, as inmates, we were placed in isolation by forcing us to remain in our cells on some sort of quarantine: sometimes the whole unit was on a confined-to-quarters type quarantine status. Our housing units still remain separated from each other.</br></br> Due to the COVID pandemic, we are only allowed to have our daily prison program around the inmates who are housed in our units, anytime that we are not in our cells, it is mandatory for us to wear face masks. Failing to do so results in a 115 disciplinary write-up. The staff also is required to wear face masks.</br></br>Vaccinations from “Pfizer” were made available to all the staff and inmates, but not made mandatory. Two shots were required 21 days apart from each other. The medical staff regularly check our temperature and test us for COVID-19 by swabbing the inside of our nostrils.</br></br>
