This story was told by a person incarcerated at Centinela.</br></br>

Caller: It’s - in what regard? Well, for the first, I’ll say the, let’s see, I got here in October, and it was basically lockdown all the time, and then we would get, you know, we would get popped out for a shower, for like a five minute shower and that was real rough, you know.</br></br>

But, so really, no dayroom, no yard. But then just over like the last month and a half or so, they started doing things differently and they're starting to give us yard, stuff like that.</br></br>

But, I mean, considering, you know, the whole mask mandate, it kinda sucks and everything, but you know, I just got my COVID vaccine, so my second shot. So I mean, considering what’s going on, you know, I mean, I don’t feel like, well you know, actually I’ll pick it up.</br></br>

Before the vaccine, I felt like holy shit, you know, this could be the end, you know. This is how I’m going to go out, you know, unfortunately. But then, after I got my vaccine, you know, they finally started administering - administering the vaccines.</br></br>

I feel safe now, you know. At least I have a, you know, a crutch. But yeah, the whole pandemic’s been pretty shitty. It kinda wears on the soul, you know.</br></br>

I can only imagine it’s worse for the guys who are doing life and shit like that, you know. But for myself, my mother, father passed away already so my sister was really all I had left, her and my little niece.</br></br>

And then my sister back in October, actually on Halloween, died and she was eight months pregnant. So her and the baby, the baby didn’t make it either, you know. So like, it's been kinda rough, you know, with the whole family and no visiting. They’ve been doing these video visits, but it’s like hell trying to get approved on those, you know.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: I’ve had a couple friends that’ve applied for it, it’s just, there’s been no response, you know, no emails back. It’s kinda hectic, you know, but I mean, I don’t have anything to compare it to, you know. This is like, this is all new, you know. It’s this whole pandemic shit. Pardon my French.
