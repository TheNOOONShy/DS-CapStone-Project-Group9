This story was told by a person incarcerated at Soledad.</br></br>

UCI: What has the COVID situation been like at your faculty?</br></br>

Caller: Right now, it’s gotten better. Last year was like our worst year. There's only like three confirmed cases out of a population of about 2,000 people.</br></br>

UCI: Well, that’s good to hear.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, that’s just one facility though. There's multiple facilities. There's three other facilities. So, the number one thing is always going to be, they got to single cell the place if they want to keep COVID down, you know, while it’s active.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>

Caller: 'Cause 92 percent of the population at this facility is vaccinated, but the problem that is going on is they just don’t get it.</br></br>

You had a major outbreak. We had like 21 people or really, I think it was higher than 21 people die at one facility. And then the prison probably 30 people died and they had like hundreds of people with COVID. And they move them around the building.</br></br>

They call themselves trying to isolate, but you know, there is an incubation period. So a guy will leave one building and they isolate him in another building and then they have an outbreak there. Then they’re moving people around and they're transferring people.</br></br>

And so now, it's come to the point where they do post-transfer isolation, but they shouldn’t be bringing anybody in for a couple of months. Whenever they have outbreaks - but they give us a better program. Last year we were locked in our cells. Now what they are doing is they're running programs by buildings.</br></br>

So like you program with your whole building and then like when they have, we have this thing called day room. So that's where you get your shower and then they have a couple of phones inside the building. </br></br>

You get a, they do half, they do one side. So half of the inmates in the building that holds like 250 people come out. So they'll have like 125 people, but they're spread out 'cause only half the building is out. And then they're allowing some people to go to work.</br></br>

They got like, they call it a critical workers list. And so that helps. There's like a couple of other little things. I mean, they gave us a - Mount Tamalpais College of San Quentin gave us a care package, which was nice.</br></br>

And then we were allowed to get COVID packages, which you actually paid for but they allowed you to get an extra package. But COVID proved something with the vendors. They were all shell-shocked 'cause canteen couldn’t handle it. They couldn’t handle the orders.</br></br>

So when you put in an order, say you put in an order of $240 to go to canteen, you’d only get like $130 worth of stuff and it creates another problem. So every month everybody is trying to go $240 'cause they don’t know when they are gonna go to canteen. So that is one of the things.</br></br>

And then the package companies, they got like 10 of them. They’re all private corporations you people or you can pay to have stuff shipped in to you. They can’t handle the orders. Sometimes they leave out like 10 of your items.</br></br>

The only silver lining on both fronts was that stimulus check but not everybody got it. No illegals got it. No Mexican nationals, nobody that was from Central America. So if you was a US-born citizen, you got it.</br></br>

And then not everybody got the check. Some people got 1,200. Some people got 600 but nobody got $3,200, and if they did it's rarity.</br></br>

So that was like one of the silver linings 'cause people had money and then they reduced how much food they’re giving us. So I don’t understand that. They call themselves cutting the food budget but it’s weird.</br></br>

UCI: Interesting. You said they have begun programs again, what do those programs look like for you?</br></br>

Caller: So, I’ll give a day of what happened today. In the morning my half of the building came out, so we had like, what they call, the day room. And then at 2:45, let’s say 3:00, they let a building go to the yard for an hour and we get night yard. So we get 7:00 to 9:00 at night and we get from 3:15 to 4:15 on the day.</br></br>

But there's three sessions a yard and there’s always one building out here right now 'cause we’re in this 15 days modified program. So us being in that 15-day modified program allows us to program independently, but they still have workers 'cause the kitchen needs people, and the laundry needs people, and PIA needs people.</br></br>

So they create a critical workers list with like, you know, a certain amount of people in each area so, you know, there’s no crowds or anything like that. When you leave your housing unit, you got to wear an N-95 mask. In the housing unit, you can wear a surgical mask. So you're really never around anybody that's not in your building right now.</br></br>
 
But before they had this shut down, we had like pretty much not regular program, but minimized, like areas. We haven't eaten in the chow hall in two years. So, which to some is great because, you know, you get fed in yourself. So if you don't want to go pick up the tray, you don't have to go out there and get it.</br></br>

You know, visits came back, but they're doing a hybrid system. The visiting is, you can have video visits, but at this prison, they only do it one day a week. So they do it on Sunday, and then you have regular visits on Friday and Saturday, but it would've been better to have video visits every day.</br></br>

And they just have a certain amount of slots for it. 'Cause it's a, it's a computer, it's a desktop computer with a camera in front of it and you sit in front of it. We had a couple of food sales. That's like a fundraiser thing where we can buy food from the street, like Jack in the Box or you know, we go through these companies and we pay exorbitant price.</br></br>

So like a cheeseburger would be $18. So, but people don't really care 'cause they want to eat real food. 'Cause we get a lot of soybean product some plant-based stuff, but it's not, it's not, it's not organic per se. It's not like shopping at Whole Foods.</br></br>

It's like shopping somewhere. We're limited on television because we don't have, we don't have the major networks other than ABC, NBC, CBS, PBS, but like, you know, the information age has changed.</br></br>

Most of the time when you're watching TV, you got 100 channels. We don't have that here. We're like one of the only institutions. We're in a dead area.</br></br>

So they're trying to get a better cable package for us. Let me think of what else is going on. They clean not to the level that they could. I honestly believe they should have 24 hour cleaning crews, 'cause I mean, this stuff is serious.</br></br>

There's really - well, by only being one building, there's a lot less, prison politics and a lot less fights because there's only one building on the yard now. So, you know, people is more worried about trying to get out of prison now than politic in it. So I think that's a good thing.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>

Caller: So we have, different programs. One of our programs, and you guys might want to check into it, was we had this, thing where we had Lisa Lang come in here and, she filmed this guy's story 'cause he got out. But they had like a prison academy, like a leadership academy.</br></br>

So those are some of the silver lining points, but it's like every time they try to do something great, like have a podcast or something like that, they either don't get full support, or something interrupts it, like either staff quits or something like that. It's always like, it's hard to believe that this is a 14 billion corporation and there's always hiccups, and I mean like major hiccups.</br></br>

A judge's ruling that they have to get people out for emergency medical transports. So what they do is if somebody has like a heart attack, instead of have staff for it, have it always staffed like that, they shut down the yard, the recreational yard, which is the biggest program. At every prison across the state.</br></br>

So they'll take the yard officers and put them in medical so they can do the medical transport instead of just hiring the right amount of police for medical. And so all the facilities suffer 'cause some days they'll have two or three medical runs. So they close all the rec yards and then they start closing buildings.</br></br>

And what I mean by closing building is they lock everybody up and there's only one officer in the building so there's no program in the building, and then if it's too many staff gone, then there's no church, there's nothing, you know. You just sit in your cell. So it's all right when football season and Olympics are happening, but when that ain't happening, you know, people want to move around 'cause that's the mental health function in it, you know, to move around.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>

Caller: So that's a, I mean, in a nutshell, it's totally different than it was last year, but it's still some things that need to be refined. They gotta single cell these prisons. There's no way in the world that you're gonna beat COVID in here unless you isolate yourself. Like I don't socialize with a lot of people.</br></br>

And I've never caught COVID, but there's a lot of people that catch it, and they don't realize that some people it affects differently. And then, you know, guys have weird things going on with their body that they don't know about, you know?</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>

Caller: You know, we have inmates that refuse the vaccine, but that's not good because then when they get sick, they get really sick. So.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah. Well, if there's anything else you'd like to share, we'd be more than happy to hear it. Thank you so much. This is a lot of information, and it'll all be used that for a good reason. So thank you for calling.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, I love your little movement, right? And I don't know where it's going to end, but if the whole UC was trying to do something like that, you know.</br></br>

And they really adopted a prison, and really went inside, and did programs and stuff. It actually could be something more like a game changer.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>

Caller: You guys are collecting data, but without action, data's worthless, you know? They proved it up at Santa, I mean, at San Quentin 'cause San Quentin, one thing about them is they're in this place, which is similar to where you guys are at, it's called Marin County.</br></br> 

And so they have a lot of musicians and artists that live in that county and they donate a lot of their time. So the volunteers there, they, that prison will have like 1,200 volunteers, but your average one has like a hundred.</br></br>

So they run all kind of innovative programs. You can learn how to draw, you can learn how to play guitar, you can learn how to play piano. I was there, like 20 years ago, they had Metallica play live there.</br></br>

Carlos Santana comes there. At this prison, we have Danny Glover. He comes here every now and then.</br></br>

And then we had Danny Trejo come here because he served time here in the sixties. So he came here for AA convention. But yeah, there's activism is what we need. Because you guys can convey our message on a different level. You know, a lot of guys speak with broken English.</br></br>

They don't know how to articulate themselves. But people that are in this movement, in this era, this is the time for evolution. So.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, we completely agree.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah. So I honestly believe you can release guys and give them 30,000 a month. I mean, 30,000 a year, instead of paying these guys 150 and you'd see a whole different outcome.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>

Caller: Thank you for your time though.</br></br>

UCI: No, thank you so much for calling and we really appreciate it.</br></br>

Caller: All right. Have a good night.</br></br>


UCI: You too.
