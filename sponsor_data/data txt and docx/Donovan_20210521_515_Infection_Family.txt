This story was told by a person incarcerated at Donovan.</br></br>


Caller: Well, what I wanna share about my story was that they brought an inmate here that was infected with COVID, and we wasn’t exposed to it until they brought him here. And they knew that he had COVID, and we all winded up catching COVID. Me, myself, catched--caught COVID because they didn’t have the proper safety procedures here. And now this guy that has COVID been walking around us and being around us, instead of having him isolated. So it was spreading, around us, and we was all infected.</br></br>


UCI: Oh wow.</br></br>


Caller: And I couldn’t--I had problems breathing, I had problems, I had all the symptoms of COVID. And I tried to explain that to the medical staff, and they really didn’t provide me anything. And then we was threatened with write-ups and stuff like that if we didn’t comply to their moves, ‘cause they was trying to move us around and all that. I was sick with COVID.</br></br>


UCI: Was that recent?</br></br>


Caller: Yes, um, well I had it in December. That’s when it spread here at R.J. Donovan. Well, on the yard I was on.</br></br>


UCI: Oh, wow, that’s not good.</br></br>


Caller: Excuse me?</br></br>


UCI: Yeah, I was just saying that’s not good, that situation.</br></br>


Caller: No, it wasn’t good at all because right now we’re still suffering. A lot of us still haven’t seen our families, you know, still, still got us kind of isolated. Like, an hour visit, hour FaceTime, on a monitor visit. You gotta set an appointment, so you know, if you don’t get that opportunity to get that appointment, you won’t see your loved one.
