This letter was written by a person incarcerated at CIW (California Institution for Women).</br></br>

I hope this letter finds you all doing well. At first I was not going to write to you guys because I thought how much could my story help. But honestly if my story could change just one person's experience then I have done something to make a difference.</br></br>

I am a female who is serving an 18 year sentence. I have been behind these bars since 2013 and as of now I will not be leaving as it stands until May of 2028. It actually made me feel important that you guys are reaching out to incarcerated mothers. As for myself I am a mother of amazing children who I have contact with since they have been adopted.</br></br>

So you wanted to know how I am handling being here and dealing with COVID-19. To be honest it hasn't been easy. And I also might be able to give you a little bit of a different take. I am housed in the mental health unit.</br></br>

However when the pandemic first started I was on the GP yard. But I have always struggled with mental problems such as depression, pica, (which is I eat things like batteries, razors, paper clips) I eat metal, others eat other things. And I also deal with hearing voices.</br></br>

So with this being said at first when it started it was not too bad until they closed everything. Then it turned to hell. So when you are in prison even if you are a lifer or long termer one of the three things people look forward to is groups, program (work or education), and visits. And with groups and education you can earn time off of your sentence (to go home sooner).</br></br>

So when this COVID-19 hit it stopped all of this and we couldn't even encourage our friends because we have to stay within our units. It has been months since I've seen some of my closest friends which is my support. My job as an education clerk has also stopped. And my job was one of the things that kept me going.</br></br>

But now let's talk about the visits, I personally do not receive them but I have seen my peers try and hurt themselves due to there being no visits and no movements within the prison. So speaking of mental health. Since being in this pandemic situation on the GP yard the mental health program is called CCCMS.</br></br> 

And regularly it is hard to see someone and with the pandemic for awhile it was not at all (so nothing for months). Their version of mental health is someone coming to the door and giving you a packet that has a deep breathing exercise, some coloring (so lets you hope you have things to color with and word searches).</br></br> 

And if you need to talk to someone they hardly ever come and if they do you have to talk through your cell door because you are locked in. But that is not private and it is never the same person. So for myself my mental health ended up taking a nose dive.</br></br>

So then in July I ended up testing positive for coronavirus so then they only let me take two net bags of stuff and having to move out of my comfort zone to a whole 'nother unit. Where they put all the people testing positive and I was bunked with a lady who was mean to me. And there mental health sucked I even have a friend who was suffering so bad that she was tired of asking for help so she set her mattress on fire, trying to kill herself.</br></br> 

Well when I got back to my unit I ended up hurting myself and had to go to crisis bed and there since we cannot touch stuff we do not get to read books. When I left there I was put in SCU/Mental Health program and here I have been able to attend some groups and have a physical and med doctor contact at least once a week.</br></br> 

But on Thanksgiving we are going back to lockdown so we will see how this goes. Just this week my grandma wrote to me and told me that my father passed away. I do not have any contact or support from any of my family so this is hard and right now they are going to be upping my level of care to PIP. I am not doing well mentally.</br></br> 

Now you asked how I feel about my safety. I do not feel safe in this place. I even caught this virus. And I have not left the prison to catch it. So that means the staff had to bring it in so that is not fair.</br></br> 

We are in a closed and controlled environment so we should have been safe but once it got here it spread like wildfire. And even while it was spreading there was still a lot of staff including sergeants, lieutenants, correctional officers, medical staff that were not wearing their masks and hanging out in groups but constantly telling us to be six feet apart and wear our masks.</br></br> 

And another thing because of the way it was and how many people were on meds (not in the mental health unit) but on the yard, since there are not enough people passing out meds and units they are making us take our noon meds with our morning 7:00 a.m. meds.</br></br>

And for our am meds we were not getting them sometimes until 10:30 a.m. and then they are combining our 5:00 p.m. with our bedtime meds. So sometimes I would get my meds at 8:45 p.m. and I am scheduled to take seroquel at 8:00 p.m. Which they were giving to me at 5:00 p.m. and crushing it so I was knocked out before 6:00 p.m.</br></br> 

And if you had meds they could not give you back to back they would change your meds without even telling you. My seroquel was at 8:00 p.m., they changed it to 5:00 p.m. without even asking me or telling me.</br></br>

So with all of this being said I have not been handling this crisis very well. And again for me it is not about family visits that gets me through. It is the ability to talk to other inmates who are my support and encouraging friends that I have not seen in months. So I think they need to change a lot of things but I want to thank you for even caring and listening.</br></br>

I hope this was helpful and it was what you were looking for. If you want me to explain something or write something different because this was not what you were looking for, please just ask me and write me back. I hope that you have a blessed, warm, loving and happy holidays. Take care of yourself.</br></br> 

And again thank you for even wanting to know about us.</br></br> 

Good luck in your studies.</br></br>

Keep your head up and keep making a difference.
