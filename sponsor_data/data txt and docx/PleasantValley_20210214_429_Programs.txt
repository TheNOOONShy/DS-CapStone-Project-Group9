This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Pleasant Valley.</br></br>I do believe in positive reform/rehabilitation studies, I myself are involved in groups that have positive results! Sample: “Prison of Peace” “Lifer’s Group” “Domestic Violence”. I stay ever so busy, attempting to reach my parole date 2024. I enclosed a nice photo of me and my gorgeous dog named Hercules, this was my better days at the Ruff Start dog program in SVSP!</br></br>

I helped start the dog program from 2016 to 2019 all I can say is that. It was like therapy, fun, exciting, helping these dogs get a second chance, you know.
