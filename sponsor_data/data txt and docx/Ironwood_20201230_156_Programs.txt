It's nice to feel acknowledged as a living person and, well, thank you for including me in your project. If you need any more writing on any other topics, let me know.</br></br>
I have been in prison now for 15 years and have a life sentence.</br></br>
This COVID-19 pandemic has definitely affected prison. We have been limited to our recreational activities which help us keep our stress down. Access to rehabilitative programs and education has been limited to in cell only courses provided by organizations outside of prison for which many of us are grateful for.
