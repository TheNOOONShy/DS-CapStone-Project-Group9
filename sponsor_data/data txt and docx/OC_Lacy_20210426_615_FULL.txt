This story was told by a person incarcerated at OC Lacy.</br></br>UCI: How are you today?</br></br>Caller: I’m good. You?</br></br>UCI: I’m good. Thank you for asking.</br></br>Caller: Yeah.</br></br>UCI: What facility are you currently housed at?</br></br>Caller: Where am I- Orange, city of Orange. Yeah.</br></br>UCI: Which facility?</br></br>Caller: Which facility? Oh, Theo Lacy facility.</br></br>UCI: Oh okay. And what have the COVID situation been like at your facility?</br></br>Caller: How has it been?</br></br>UCI: Yes.</br></br>Caller: Well, it’s been like- well honestly like I really don’t know because I’ve experienced it more in the street honestly.</br></br>UCI: Oh.</br></br>Caller: But it’s like normal, I guess. It’s like, nobody here has it.</br></br>UCI: Well, what guidelines do they have in place there? Like just so like I can envision like how it would be.</br></br>Caller: Well alright for example, like let’s say for example somebody gets arrested right. For example, like me. And then, when you’re at the substation, they ask you have you been in contact with anybody that has COVID? Things like that. Do you feel like you have COVID?</br></br>So then they um take your temperature and then you get transferred to the main facility right? Which is in Santa Ana. So then once you’re there, you go through the process of getting booked into the county jail. Whatever.</br></br>Then, they take your street clothes and then you get transferred. And then they put you in their clothes and then the transfer you to whichever facility or cell, dorm that they want to.</br></br>UCI: Hmm.</br></br>Caller: And once you’re there, they put you in quarantine. Which is probably like three weeks, maybe even longer. It depends if you have it or not. And then they’ll come and they’ll test you out. They’ll- they’ll come and they’ll do COVID test, COVID swab, whatever.</br></br>And then, once you’re there, once you’re like been cleared, like for longer than like three weeks, then you’re officially like cleared. Well like obviously, right? Then, you get house, which is called like regular housing, so that means that you can interact with people that don’t have it.</br></br>So we’re like still doing the six feet rule thing. But other than that, it’s- in the beginning, once you come in, yeah, we’re very cautious about that cause nobody’s trying to catch COVID. But after the fact that we’ve been clean and cleared and healthy and things like that, everything is just normal, back to normal basically.</br></br>Well not normal completely, but it's not as bad as how it was in the beginning.</br></br>UCI: Okay. That’s good to hear. So, since they have been releasing vaccinations, so how’s the vaccination situation been like at your facility?</br></br>Caller: How what?</br></br> UCI: How has the vaccination situation been at your facility?</br></br>Caller: A lot of people are getting it. I haven’t got it, I don’t- I’m not gonna get it. I don’t think I need it because I caught COVID already and I got over it. And I just don’t trust taking that shot.</br></br>Well, first of all, the Johnson and Johnson one has started having problems. We both know that.</br></br>UCI: Mhm.</br></br>Caller: They say that they fixed the problem with the vaccination thing, but I don’t know how sure that is and I don’t know how positive that shot will be, for me in the long run. So I’m not gonna to take that. The two shot one or the three shot one, I don’t trust it because I- for the same reason, I don’t know what the effects is going to be for me in the long run. So I don’t trust it.</br></br>UCI: Okay. So have they offered the vaccinations to everyone there?</br></br>Caller: Yeah, everybody.</br></br>UCI: Okay, that’s good. And so how has this COVID situation at your facility affected your loved ones?</br></br>Caller: How has it affected my loved ones?</br></br>UCI: Yes.</br></br>Caller: With me being in here?</br></br>UCI: Yes. With COVID, the COVID situation.</br></br>Caller: Well honestly like, well I mean, not that- I mean, people are- like my family’s still living their own life, you know what I mean? So, my kids, well it’s not really like, it’s not really- I mean we take it serious and its serious but it’s like since we’re still healthy and we’re all healthy right now-</br></br>UCI: Mmm.</br></br>Caller: Then nobody’s going to be stressed out that I’m in here and the COVID is almost ending. But in the beginning of the COVID, being- I mean I haven’t been here all my life right?</br></br>UCI: Mhm.</br></br>Caller: I haven’t been here. I’ve only been here for a couple months cause I was out there working things like that. Well not working because of the pandemic but I was in the streets not that long ago.</br></br>Well anyways, it hasn’t really affected us. It just affected us because I’m not at work and I’m not bringing home food or, I’m talking about being in jail not because of COVID.</br></br>UCI: Yeah.</br></br>Caller: But because the COVID thing, it’s just, it really doesn’t, it’s just like whatever now. You know? Cause I mean it’s been like what a year to change and it’s like we got used to it. We basically adapted on how to maneuver ourselves around and away from things like that.</br></br>Like to go to the store. We adapted to the new process of going to the store. We’ve adapted to the new process of ordering from like Uber Eats or Postmates, things like that. So we got used to not going out, things like that. But other than that, it’s not that bad.</br></br>UCI: Okay. And how have you been coping with the crisis while you are there?</br></br>Caller: How have I been coping with it?</br></br>UCI: Yes.</br></br>Caller: I just read a lot. I just read a lot of books. I really don’t pay attention to what is going on. I really don’t, honestly, I really don’t pay attention to what other people are doing because then it’s not, none of my concern what other people are doing.</br></br> As long as they don’t bother me, I just want them to leave me alone. And about the pandemic thing, since none of us have it, I’m just, honestly, I’m just scared that my family is going to catch it and get sick. Because I don’t want my family to get sick.</br></br>UCI: Mhm.</br></br>Caller: I mean I honestly don’t want nobody around me to get sick because then I’m going to have to be careful, extra careful not to get sick. So, that’s it.</br></br>UCI: Okay. That sounds good. And what else did you want the people to know about your experience?</br></br>Caller: Well, honestly, I’m excited to see what like, because okay a long time ago right? A long time ago I seen this news thing, right? I was watching this documentary about some- oh you know that guy in the wheelchair that talks like a computer?</br></br>UCI: Mhm.</br></br>Caller: I think, you know what I’m talking about?</br></br>UCI: Yes.</br></br>Caller: Yeah, well anyway, I think it was him or some other guy, right? Some philosopher or some smart guy, right? He said that something was going to happen to the world, it’s something is going to happen to the whole world to us.</br></br>After that had happened, it’s either going to fix us or beak us. You know what I mean? It’s either going to make the world a better place or it’s either going to make the world- a worser place.</br></br>So, honestly I honestly think because we are all trying to stay healthy and we’re all like basically on the same page on terms to stay healthy, I think it’s going to be better now that like it’s going to be like looser or something like that.</br></br>We’re get to come out more. We get to interact now. We get to go to the pool. We get to go to the beach now. We have money.</br></br>The houses are going to be a little bit of expensive, a little bit more expensive because of the pandemic and it’s a high demand. So, the houses are going to be a little bit more expensive for maybe one more year or two more years and then the price value is going to drop.</br></br>Like the camaraderie is like coming back to normal so that’s kinda good. So I’m excited for that. Other than that, it’s just, I’m just excited to come back to so everything can come back to normal, honestly.</br></br>UCI: That’s good to hear. And thank you for sharing that with me.</br></br>Caller: Yeah.</br></br>UCI: I also want to thank you very much for participating in the PrisonPandemic. Please consider telling your friends about us and see if they would like to call in.</br></br>Caller: Yeah. Hey, what college you going to?</br></br>UCI: This is project based at the University of California, Irvine.</br></br>Caller: Oh, this is in Irvine?</br></br>UCI: Yes.</br></br>Caller: How old are you if you don’t mind me asking?</br></br>UCI: I am [redacted].</br></br>Caller: [Redacted]. Okay, okay. That’s good, that’s good. Okay well that’s basically, I mean I’m only asking because I mean I went to college too, I just didn’t graduate. I needed one more year to graduate but this is like a long time ago, this is like in my twenties. But I didn’t graduate but I did go to college and I like it.</br></br>UCI: Mhm.</br></br>Caller: But yeah. Other than that, it’s all good. But it was nice talking to you bro.</br></br>UCI: Thank you, thank you. Have a good night.</br></br>Caller: You too. Have a nice day man.
