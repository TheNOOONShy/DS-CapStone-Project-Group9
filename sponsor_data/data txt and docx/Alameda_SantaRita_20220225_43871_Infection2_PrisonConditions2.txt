This story was told by a person incarcerated at Santa Rita Jail.</br></br>

UCI: And when you do get to go or if they’re going to attempt to, do they provide masks for you?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah. They provide masks and everything, but the point of it is, they bring people in here in our pods to infect us on purpose so they can quarantine us. And they are doing this all over the jail. That’s why we have so many reported outbreaks in Santa Rita County Jail, 'cause they’re doing it on purpose. Yeah.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm. And-</br></br> 

Caller: Yeah.</br></br>

UCI: The staff don’t follow proper protocol for quarantining people around you, do they follow proper protocols for themselves?</br></br>

Caller: For themselves?</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br> 

Caller: Yeah, but not the inmates.</br></br>

UCI: Okay.</br></br>

Caller: Because the financial gains for them, if they cause us to miss court, it prolongs us from getting out and keeping us quarantined. So, they have it listed in our unit. I can’t say our unit. Can I say our unit?</br></br>

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: [Redacted]. They had it on the computer and as if we were quarantined until the 18th of this month. When all actuality, we were off on the 7th of this month, but they had it posted to fool the public to justify them not taking - you see, it was only one pod in six buildings that was on quarantine out of the five other pods in here. So, six pods total, only one was on quarantine.</br></br>

All the other pods were off. All other five pods were off quarantine, but they weren’t letting us go to court out of the whole building on purpose. They play a little psychological game and they lie and try to deny everything. But they’ve done it, and now, they can’t really get out of it because they got the guy in here.</br></br>

They moved him in here like that on purpose from a non-quarantine unit, where he could’ve went to court to stop him from going to court - I mean, going to court on his court date, and then load us up for both us and have the same sergeant review it and also conduct our disciplinary rules by violation hearing. He illegally violated all our due process rights.</br></br>

That’s why we have them in court and they got the approval consent to decree, settlement, approve, but now we are appealing it, because look, what they did, not even a week after it. Hello?
