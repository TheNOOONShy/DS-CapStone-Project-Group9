This story was told by a person incarcerated at CMC (California Men’s Colony). </br></br>Caller: You know, cuz it did affect me, not the way it did other inmates here.</br></br>

At least at that point in time, I didn't get affected as much because I completely lost a little bit of my sense of smell. And not so much anything else. But now that I'm kind of looking at it.</br></br>

Like I'm having a hard time breathing and stuff like that. I think it affected me more than I thought. And I think the way a lot of guys here- I think the way they feel was that we weren’t quite understanding how- where they’re just kind moving inmates from one dorm to other dorms, kind of just moving guys around.</br></br>

And putting them into a facility where other housing units were like “well we’ve been resolved, considered resolved,” which means they've been at least two weeks to get a positive test and will resolve already into bringing in those who just tested positive so some guys were kinda questioning that trying to figure, well, why are they doing that? We couldn’t figure out why, what was the reasoning behind it. So-</br></br>

So I’m not sure exactly what kind of questions you have.
