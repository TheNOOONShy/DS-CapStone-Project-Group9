This story was told by a person incarcerated at Fresno County Jail.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, you haven't received medical isolation? And what kind of medicine or anything have they gave you?</br></br>

Caller: No, they just put us on quarantine and wait it out. They come every other day to check our vitals or temperature checks.</br></br>

UCI: So, you were saying you had three times COVID?</br></br>

Caller: I had it. Yes, I had it three times.</br></br>

UCI: You were tested positive? So you're sure it was COVID instead of just influenza?</br></br>

Caller: Okay, so this is what they're doing in the beginning of the pandemic. People who are negative they were switched to different facilities; people who were positive, they were switched to different facilities.</br></br>

During my time of being sick, they took my test, and I came out negative even though I had the symptoms three times. They there were switching me around different facilities inside the correction place and I don't know what that was about.</br></br>

I would go to one facility, and then people were being sick in that facility, so they would switch me to a different facility on a different floor. And people were sick in there, and I got switched again. I didn't understand what they were doing there. People were getting sick while switching to different facilities.</br></br>

UCI: Since you said you were testing negative, they would want you to be away from the ones that who were testing positive.</br></br>

Caller: The ones that were testing positive were getting moved either to a different facility or heading to the infirmary. At this moment, they're isolating the ones that are positive.
