This story was told by a person incarcerated at Solano.</br></br>

UCI: They just kept shuffling you from, you know, building to building. And were you told why you were being moved?</br></br> 

Caller: They said, the first one is ‘cause somebody in my dorm tested positive, so they moved everybody to quarantine. The same day he tested positive, I tested negative. So, when I get to the, to the quarantine building, that’s where I get, contract COVID-19 ‘cause I’m moving in to a cell that somebody’s just moving out of, and they didn’t clean the cell or spray it down or anything. They just moved me in there and I caught COVID that way.</br></br>

UCI: And how was your experience with COVID?</br></br>

Caller: The headaches were the worst thing. That was it.</br></br> 

UCI: That was it.</br></br>

Caller: Everything else I dealt with. Huh?</br></br>
 
UCI: That was it. So you had a fairly mild case, yeah.</br></br>

Caller: The headaches were so, was bad ‘cause it made my nose bleed. That’s how, that’s how painful, painful it was. My nose was bleeding, started bleeding out of the blue.</br></br>

UCI: Man, and you weren’t able to, did you ever see a doctor, even two, three weeks later after you tested positive? Or just never saw any sort of medical staff?</br></br>

Caller: Well, all they did was take my temperature. Say, “You havin’ COVID-19?” Say, “Yeah,” then they keep on going. Then, when I got found positive, they, they, they tested me positive, they moved me to the building. Then from there, they moved me, from there, they moved me here.
