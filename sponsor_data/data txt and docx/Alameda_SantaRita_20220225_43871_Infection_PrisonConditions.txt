This story was told by a person incarcerated at Santa Rita Jail.</br></br>

UCI: And then, what has the COVID situation been like at your facility?</br></br>

Caller: At my facility, they are exposing us to it on purpose, so they can say we are on quarantine to stop us from going to court to prolong us from getting released on our court date.</br></br> 

UCI: Mm-hmm. And-</br></br>

Caller: And they’re doing that here in this facility.</br></br>

UCI: And what does them exposing you look like?</br></br>

Caller: It’s the deputies, and the - really more so the deputies and the classification, and the deputies in our housing unit. They run a person that wasn’t - didn’t complete their 14-day cycle of isolation before being moved to any unit, to ensure he is not contagious with the coronavirus. They moved him in here to either massively re-infect us.</br></br>

We were already on quarantine for the most recent outbreak, where a couple of people came down with it inside of our pod, and they moved him in here to keep it going. And then, when we were off quarantine from it, they still kept pretending they didn’t believe we were off quarantine so they wouldn’t transport us to court.</br></br>

I went off, and I actually got taken to court three and a half hours later, right across the street from the Santa Rita Jail to the courthouse. It took them three and a half hours to get me there late. Because they were trying to get the hazard pay from being on quarantine and keep people in jail as long as possible by making a mess of their regularly scheduled court date during the pandemic when a lot of people are being released. They wanted to make sure that didn’t happen for as long as possible.
