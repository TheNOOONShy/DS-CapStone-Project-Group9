Dear PrisonPandemic,</br></br>

I’m 28 years old. I was first sent to jail in May 2020 right when everything kicked off. In jail they would quarantine the new arrivals for two weeks then send us to our housing unit. But come to find out, the whole Monterey County Jail was infected by August and October. They stopped our canteens. All we could order was prepackaged things that the sheriffs delivered.</br></br> 

By November 2020, mind you, I haven’t got COVID yet. I’ve never done any prison terms prior to this. So I get to Wasco Reception Center and I get put into quarantine for two weeks and sometimes three or four weeks at a time. No programs or group phone calls. If we are lucky, once a week showers, maybe three times a week, sometimes twice.</br></br>

By December 2020, I caught COVID-19 so I got tested. It came back positive so I’m trippin’, thoughts racing but only to find out I was asymptomatic. I had no symptoms or signs so far. I’ve seen three people die in front of me on outside my cell block door.</br></br> 

It’s been really hard for me in here because I have a mom, dad, brother, and sister out there. There are no visits but for me it’s not the same. When I got the virus I was told I wouldn’t have signs or symptoms. But I was contagious so all they did for me was check my vitals and signs, BP, oxygen, temp, etc. For two weeks some people was longer.</br></br>

From November to February I was in reception then I was sent to Salinas Valley State Prison. My safety here compared to Wasco’s is I’m more high alert who’s where at. Wasco we were locked down more, here we come out interact with people. So it’s a respect one another kind of thing. The vaccinations are coming and I’ve seen people get them, my celly got his.</br></br>

As far as me, I probably won’t till later 'cause I’ve had the virus and so far I’ve been negative. For me, coping with this stress is difficult, my family hardly writes. But we can barely talk on the phone. I’m single and this letter really got to me cuz I don’t have any other pen pal so it would be google to get to know you.</br></br>

But imma be totally honest, there is so much drugs here it’s insane. It’s like the streets- wax, meth, heroine, weed, mainly. There's how some of us cope with the stress. I would be home next year sometime but seems so far out. There’s barely any programs right now but I wanna get my GED, learn a few things for re-entry cuz this is one place I don’t wanna ever come back to prison.</br></br> 

With COVID having everything shut down, we have no access to library or anything. We would be able to access everything is to be requested through paper via mail. As for me, I’m barely getting by. Tensions are high and I don’t want to piss off the wrong person. I wish they would make a reform or change something to where I can go home faster. My dad is 66, and I’m afraid he’ll catch this nasty virus.</br></br>

Everyday I pray for a miracle, well today I got your letter- that’s a start. I really hope I hear back from PrisonPandemic soon. I almost forgot I got assaulted by Wasco correctional officers for trying to get basic things so I’m scared that I can’t go to CO and ask a question. But PrisonPandemic, it’s cool you picked me to write.</br></br> 

It’s rare I get picked for anything but to be a part of a history of prison and world pandemic, I'm all in. Some days are harder than others, I’ve seen two deaths and one suicide. There’s one guy that just took out who later died at the hospital. I hope this letter finds you in good health 'till next time. I’m hopeful you can write back.</br></br> 

PS. It’s crazy to see face masks in prison, dirty syringes 10 to 15 guys share. And man the list goes on.</br></br>

With most respect and best wishes.</br></br>

'Till next time.
