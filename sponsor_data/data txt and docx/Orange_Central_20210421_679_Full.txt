Hello PrisonPandemic,</br></br>I received your letter, and I would like to send my respect and appreciation your way. Thank you for taking the time to write me and express your concern for the difficult times that we're enduring here in the county jail.</br></br>First and foremost, I've been incarcerated for about nine months now and it's been extremely painful and hard. I've been eating nothing but "sack lunched" this whole time. The meat is expired sometimes so you can't even eat it because it will make you sick.</br></br>So, for whoever doesn't have store you go hungry in here. I really hope and pray that we start getting hot meals soon, because we all have been suffering without a hot plate.</br></br>Second, the visiting, I haven't been able to see a loved one throughout this whole time I've been down either. Again, if they don't have money on the phone then you have no contact with them (other than the five minutes from the free phone call, once a week).</br></br>Another big issue was/is that we are still not six feet apart to prevent the spread of COVID-19. So, I got arrested at the end of August 2020 and I had been COVID free until I got arrested. I've tested positive for COVID-19 twice!</br></br>The second time I got infected in jail was horrible. I felt like my bones were weak and felt drained of life completely. In other words, getting incarcerated during the pandemic has been the worst experience/suffering I've ever gone through in my life.</br></br>From getting infected twice to not even having a hot meal. It's really been strange and unusual punishment that I wish no one ever has to go through. My safety has really been jeopardized throughout these last few months here in Orange County Jail.</br></br>The way we've been treated is inhumane and I wish the situation changes as soon as possible! Conclude this letter with full love and respect. Thanks again.</br></br>Sincerely.
