Dear PrisonPandemic,</br></br>

I am in receipt of your words and they were received in this very same spirit in which they were sent.</br></br>

I take this time out to gather my thoughts, and pour them onto a couple of sheets of paper in attempts of sharing my experience from March 2020 ‘til now. Pertaining to the dark cloud that slowly rolled over the roofs of this prison and parked there.</br></br>

I think the best title that could encapsulate my experience would be, “From a Whisper to a Scream,” because that is how the plague called COVID-19 hit us.</br></br>

For months we were held up well. We would see and hear the tallies of those who tested positive in other prisons, on the news, throughout newsletters, and by word of mouth of staff members who were still allowed to come in.</br></br> 

The self-help groups vanished first, they were sponsored by whom we call “free people,” who weren’t employees of the state or shall I say of the prison.</br></br> 

Next, the education programs and the vocational programs were shuttered. We were still able to go to the yard and have dayroom activities. And kitchen workers, building porters, law library clerks, yard crew workers were still allowed to go to their assignments. We were still allowed to check out sports equipment and board games.</br></br>

Next came the masks, we were each given four masks a piece, cloth masks that we were urged to wash every other day. Still no positive cases in sight and we were deep into June. Visiting had been suspended since March, yard became limited to one-building at a time.</br></br> 

Board games and sports equipment could no longer be checked out and only one tier at a time (each building has two tiers) were allowed to come out to dayroom, basically for phone calls and showers.</br></br>

Next came a deeper modification, only 25 cells at a time were allowed to come out at a time. 25 percent of the building for phones and showers. Then came the day where one of our kitchen workers on yard supposedly went to a doctor’s appointment at an outside hospital, and was put on quarantine. And tested positive upon his return to the prison, this was in August.</br></br>

He tested positive which in turn caused the staff to quarantine all of the kitchen workers on his shift in attempts of containing it. Then the other shift in the kitchen was also quarantined. Then began the testing of the entire yard.</br></br>

About 40 positives out of 1,000, while at the same time the other yards were getting tested and also resulted in multiple positives. We were immediately put on lockdown. One entire building on our yard (our yard contains five buildings with 200 men in each) was emptied and made into a COVID hotspot for the entire prison.</br></br>

It quickly filled, then another building was emptied and also filled with COVID patients, some had symptoms, some had minor symptoms, some showed none.</br></br>

I personally was on a quest not to catch it. I wore my mask diligently, kept them washed, washed my hands, socially distanced, and as we were put on a regimen of weekly testing. No yard, no dayroom, canteen and morning and evening meals were brought to our cell doors.</br></br>

Those who took medication had it brought to them. People still kept testing positive, more and more each week.</br></br>

It ravished our building, and every week we stood at our doors on test result days to see who was next. It was like the TV show “Big Brother” and nobody knew when it would be their turn to pack up their property and be moved out of the building. Many had been living in the same cell for years.</br></br>

By November, half of our building had been emptied and refilled. We were given a chemical solution that we were to use on our sinks, doors, phones, etc.</br></br>

Officers started coming up missing in action, testing positive. I made it past Thanksgiving which was a herculean defeat but finally tested positive on December 9th and moved to quarantine. By then over 1,500 of the 8,400 of us at the prison had tested positive and eight had died.</br></br>

My symptoms were minimal, no smell, no taste, a sore throat. I lost 11 pounds which was fine with me. I was recently released from quarantine on January 9th, a full 30 days later. After having my vitals checked twice a day and given OTC medication for my sore throat.</br></br>

I feel fine, the entire prison has somewhat regained a sense of normalcy, well, not entirely. We are back to coming out for showers, phones, and one building at a time for yard. We are walking to chow for our meals, those who take medications are allowed to walk to medical to pick up their meds.</br></br>

Some probably write in horror stories of their experiences in prison while dealing with COVID-19. I could only write my truth as best as I see fit. Well, I pray that everybody is able to get vaccinated. We will be vaccinated next month or at least those who wish to.</br></br> 

And that they are wearing their masks, washing their hands, socially distancing, and doing what they can do to stay safe as well as assist others through these tough times.</br></br>

Respectfully.
