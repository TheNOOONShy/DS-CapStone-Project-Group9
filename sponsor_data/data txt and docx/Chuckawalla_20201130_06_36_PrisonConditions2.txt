UCI: So how was COVID-19 handled at your facility at the beginning of the outbreak?</br></br>
Caller: It was terrible. They - pretty much we had rules where they didn’t want us to mix like another building.</br></br> 

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br> 

Caller: But then the COs would let them other people walk in like nothing.</br></br> 

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: People that were sick. And then we found out that the people that were coming in were infected.</br></br>
UCI: And is it being handled differently now?</br></br>
Caller: Somewhat. You still see some people coming into the buildings.</br></br>
UCI: Okay. And what have they improved on?</br></br>
Caller: I'm sorry.</br></br>
UCI: Have they improved on anything?</br></br>
Caller: I don’t really see anything improved. I mean, just more mask wearing. They’re more stricter on mask wearing. That’s, that’s pretty much everything.</br></br>
UCI: And what would make the situation at your facility better?</br></br>
Caller: What would what?</br></br>
UCI: What would make the situation at your facility better?</br></br> 
Caller: Well, if they were just more stricter on mask wearing.</br></br>
I mean, I know they’re, I know they’re trying to keep us separated, keep us six feet but it's just kind of impossible because we’re like sardines in here.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br> 

Caller: We’re just, there's just, there’s nowhere to space out.</br></br>

UCI: Right.</br></br>

Caller: And keep space. Everybody’s just pretty much just, "Okay. Well, just wear your mask and that’s it.
