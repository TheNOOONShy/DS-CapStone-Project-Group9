This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Lancaster.</br></br>

I mentioned that I am also suffering from the aftereffects of traumatic brain injury and I cannot afford to get COVID because COVID causes brain swelling and when I had my injury, my brain swelled and I had a blood vessel burst and intracranial bleeding- I almost died. I asked for the system to at least consider commutation or at the very least, medical told me to go to custody- custody told me to file with medical. And then the vicious cycle continues forever.
