This story was told by a person incarcerated at Santa Rita Jail.</br></br>

Caller: Hello?</br></br>

UCI: What is their proper quarantining protocol for someone who does test positive?</br></br>

Caller: They remove him and then place him in isolation until he is, I guess, clear. Clear from no longer being contagious. But a person that just gets arrested is supposed to stay in isolation for 14 days.</br></br>

They didn’t do that with this guy. They just moved him in here because after - they assaulted him. They assaulted him and put him in ad seg, and then moved him from ad seg that was not in quarantine, without him being clear of COVID, and put him in our pod while we were on quarantine to make sure he couldn’t go to court.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br> 

Caller: And then they tried that on me. I went off and then after I went to court, they still stopped people going to court out of our pod. And then they punished me for it.</br></br>

They took my phone privileges, took my video visiting because I had the National Lawyers Guild come and get me a video visit. And I showed them on the screen that they were illegally keeping us locked up in our houses and they have all three class - separate, different classifications out at pod time at the same time. They had me in medium behavioral mental health and protective custody, and it wasn’t pod time, but it was video visiting.</br></br>

It was his single pod time and the other guy’s video visit, and then me had a video visit at the same time, and they let this guy get eaten up by bed bugs for over three months. And won’t have a professional come in here to sterilize the cell. They just keep moving people and he keeps re-infecting other people, and they get moved, and separated in other pods. That’s what’s been happening.
