Hello, I am not sure who I am responding to. I kinda got thrown off cause the return address on the envelope says Kirsten Turney however the letter inside was signed by Jess. So I guess I am responding to Jess. First off I just want to thank you for taking the time to not only send a letter but also for the drawings on it. It is not often that people just reach out like that or care to do so. Anyways, in response to your questions about COVID-19 a lot has changed in the last year. 
<br><br>
As far as what it has been like during this time it has been kinda frustrating. Everything was and is still affected. I guess the first major setback (for me at least) was that I was enrolled in college and was just about to finish two classes. I had probably about two weeks left and one paper to complete my clases and I was withdrawn from them. They were shut down and I wasn't able to complete them or get any credit for them. This was especially frustrating for me because it was not easy for me to enroll or do the classes. The last time I had been in a classroom setting was ninth grade when I dropped out of highschool. So it was kinda overwhelming at first but once I was enrolled and about to finish my first college classes I was happy and proud of myself for actually doing it and completing it. I wasn't able to complete them however and this was really discouraging and I was upset and felt like giving up.

Other things that were affected was our program. Visits were cancelled and taken away, we now get cell fed. Our outside yard is limited and most importantly I think that our medical and dental services were restricted. You can not get treated for any issues really now unless it is an emergency. Dental will not do fillings, cleanings, etcâ€¦ and are just pulling teeth if it is that painful. So any medical, dental issues that are not being treated are getting worse. There is absolutely no way to social distance here. For a few months COVID was pretty well contained in this prison however just recently in February of 2021, pretty much everyone contracted COVID-19.

It hit some people harder than others. A lot of the older inmates were taken to the hospital. As for myself it put me down for 2 weeks. I couldn't really eat and would just mostly sleep. Nurses would come in to check our vitals twice a day. They are just now barely starting to offer vaccinations for the general population. Visits are now 30 minutes and over a monitor. It hasn't been the easiest thing to deal with but I am sure that is the case right now world wide for everyone. Hopefully within the next six months to a year things will be somewhat back to normal however I don't think things will ever be the same. 
<br><br>
I am pretty sure this pandemic has changed the world forever. I hope this helped your cause somewhat. 
<br><br>
Sincerely,
