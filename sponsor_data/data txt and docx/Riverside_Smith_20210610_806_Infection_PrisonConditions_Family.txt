UCI: Alright, and what has the COVID situation been like at your facility?</br></br>

Caller: Well, I've been here almost 20 months now. I was here right at the height of the COVID. They had us on a 23 hour lockdown where we're only allowed out of our cells for about 35 minutes a day to shower and make phone calls and drop letters. They tried to separate people that were getting sick as best as possible.</br></br> 

There were actually a few that did pass in the jail. They never released it. And as of now they never told us how many. But, they tried to separate people that were infected.</br></br>

It was - It's kind of rough in the jail. Conditions were just, you know, were horrible. They were just horrible because we just weren't allowed out of our cells for very much. I did get sick once but I never actually tested positive for COVID. I have been vaccinated. Finally I was vaccinated.</br></br>

UCI: Good.</br></br>

Caller: I got both shots. I hadn't had much contact with my family members. Are you still there, miss?</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, I'm still here. I'm listening.</br></br>

Caller: Okay, I hadn't had much contact with my family members for canteen or just their regular visits. They had the jail on a lockdown where you weren't allowed to have visits.
