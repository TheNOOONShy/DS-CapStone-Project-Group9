UCI: Right. And how have you been coping with the crisis so far?</br></br>Caller: Well, now it just feels like it's the new norm, honestly, but it - it's - it's tough. It takes a toll on you. It's a lot of stress.</br></br>We're limit - before we'd be able to be outside from 8:00 to 9:00 at night - from 8:00 in the morning until 9:00 at night. Now we're getting an hour and a half of yard a day, if that, because if a new test positive - if someone tests positive, then they cancel the yard. It's - it's a - people moving in and out the buildings, it's - it's, you know, it has affected me.</br></br>And I don't even know how to deal with it anymore but just hope, you know, the virus doesn't come back and get it a second time.
