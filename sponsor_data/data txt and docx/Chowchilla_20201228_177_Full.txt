Hello, my name is [redacted].</br></br> 

Well I got here in prison on 11-2020. I’m still here on A yard. When I first arrived to the prison, I got tested for the COVID-19 before we was able to go to through R&R, where they processed us at after we went through all the steps before getting housed in. That is a two-man cell, and we were housed there for 14 days while I was housed in. 

There were nurses there, day in and day out, swabbing and temp checks on a daily basis. Now my 14 days was up in. They had inmates that came from over the wall from B, C, D yard to be housed in because someone tested positive, or a possible.</br></br>

Me myself don’t feel safe as of now because they brought 180 inmates from over the wall on 12-23-2020 and in [redacted]. They are housing the inmates that is positive. So where do that leave us? In danger. I fell because we can’t go over the wall yet.</br></br> 

I'm a mother also that have kids out there. Two with a sick baby daddy that is 64 years old that is in and out of the hospital. I'm ready to go home and to take care of my family. And my kids are safe right now. But also me and myself, I have high blood pressure. I take a pill every day for the percentage in the prison has went up with the COVID-19 since I got here on 11-2020. The prison needs to do some cakes so we can get out of here. My control date is 8-21, but I'm praying to get out before that.</br></br> 

Well here is my story for you all. I want to wish you all a Merry Christmas and a happy New Year and wish you all a great New Year. And be safe and God bless you all.</br></br>

Thank you so much for writing me.
