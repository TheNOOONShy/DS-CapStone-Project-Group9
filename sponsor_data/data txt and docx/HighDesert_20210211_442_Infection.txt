This letter was written by a person incarcerated at High Desert.</br></br>


So not too long ago COVID hit the yard. My building someone had it. They quarantined the whole building and I thought that was that. We quarantine for two weeks and it will be over. But everything they did after that is what led to the whole prison catching COVID.</br></br>


So they came around to test us all and before getting the test back, they had inmates passing out food (the C.O.s were supposed to during quarantine). Then they get results back and the inmates that were passing out food with no mask on tested positive, and a bunch others. And for some reason all the inmates that tested positive were moved to another yard with another inmate population.</br></br>


Then they tested us all again and before they got results back they moved around 30 inmates to a yard where they weren’t on quarantine, then they got results back and they were all positive spreading corona. Then for the next 2 months they shuffled inmates around, spreading corona through the prison.</br></br>


Meanwhile, medical and C.O.s kept us in the dark whenever I asked what was going on medical and C.O.s made it seem as if they had a secret. Basically I couldn’t get info from either group.</br></br>


I wasn’t told I had corona until 3 weeks after the fact, and when I told the Dr. I still had symptoms, she told me to drink plenty of water, and I had to demand my own follow-up. For a month the C.O.s were making our food trays because finally all inmates were quarantined. The food was slapped on thin paper trays and all mixed together. For more than a month, food was cold and wet and when I filed a complaint, I was told the food temp was checked and it was up to standards.</br></br>


It’s been horrible, they will move two sick inmates out of a cell and turn around and put two healthy inmates in that same cell. Medical knew this was going on and said nothing to the C.O.s. The C.O.s blame medical and medical blames C.O.s and we are the victims. Animals. Worse. I used to treat my dog better than they treat me.
