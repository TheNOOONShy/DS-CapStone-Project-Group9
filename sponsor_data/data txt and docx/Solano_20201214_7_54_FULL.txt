This story was told by a person incarcerated at Solano.</br></br>Caller: Solano State Prison.</br></br>UCI: Okay and what is the current COVID-19 situation like at your facility?</br></br>Caller: Right now, it is a disaster. Um, they have, the outbreaks at um it has exploded. Within the last two weeks, me personally I have had around 100 people-</br></br>
So things are getting, uh, real bad so they did the out of our, out of our building into self-quarantine to uh another facility, well another yard, same facility. And they put us, at first, they had us in our own cells. And from there things just start getting worse.</br></br>Because, they start testing us, and whenever we started becoming positive, uh, they moved everybody that was positive in the gym. Here in this and they put uh bunk beds in the gym and, and this is where things are getting out of hand. Because we’ve been in this, I have been in this gym for days now.</br></br>UCI: Mhm.</br></br>Caller: Anybody- The gym is leaking, water everywhere. We didn’t have cleaning supplies to clean the bathroom or the shower. We don’t have six feet of social distancing. And, we took, and to make matters worse, it’s freezing cold up in here.</br></br> They have rats and roaches. And so to- and, and then what made the, the straw that broke the camel’s back for us was, uh the sergeant came in here late last night and noticed everybody had their stuff on, on top of the top bunk. And so, um, the top bunk is not occupied because we have uh most of the time, a single bunk.</br></br>And then we don’t have a bunkie. And so when she left out, uh, that night, yesterday night, last night, she told officers to tell us not to put stuff on the top bunk. And when she made that announcement over intercom, we were like wait a minute, what is wrong with this lady?</br></br>
You mean to tell me this lady is not concerned about our health? We don’t know what’s going on. For all we know we about to die.</br></br>We don’t have people to clean the bathrooms and clean the showers. We don’t have, uh, you know, uh, sanitary stuff. It’s water everywhere in here, it’s leaking, and it’s vermin. And this woman is- don’t want us to put our stuff on the top locker so it don’t get wet and we don’t have, uh, mice going through our foods.</br></br>And so, what we did is we demanded to see the sergeant. And so, the officers called the sergeant up in here and we, we start talking to her and we said, “What is going on?” You know, you know. “You send, you send, you send, you send, can you send a cleaning crew up in here to, uh, you know, to make sure that we have, uh, you know, uh, a clean facility that you got us in?”</br></br>
And she told us that, uh, “Yeah if there’s gonna be some cleaning going on, it’s going to be one of y’all.” So that uh perplexed us. We were flabbergasted. We was like wait a minute, we up in here fighting for our life. And you mean to tell me that the only cleaning that’s going get done is going to have to be by one of us?</br></br>
I said what in the hell is the, what and we were like what. I- we’re supposed to be recovering. We’re supposed to be resting. We’re not supposed to be cleaning up no bathroom, cleaning up the shower, we’re popping.</br></br>
So she told us, “That’s just the way it is, you’re going to have to deal with it.” So then we addressed the problem about the, um, the vermin and the leaky roof. And a leaky roof is a construction problem. And, uh, she sit back and said, “Well, just put in a work order for that.”</br></br>And I’m, I’m saying like, “A work order? How, if you put in a work order for a leaky roof, you mean to tell me a plain officer is gonna come out? They’re not gonna sit back and, uh, and, and tear the roof apart to fix the leak.” You know what I mean?</br></br>You would think that when I told her the- so we pointed out the water, that she would say okay I’ll send some guys up in here with wet drawbacks, to get to clean up the, um, the water. But instead she told us, “I don’t know what to tell you, um, to put in a work order.” You know?</br></br>
And then, this is what another thing that made me so frustrated. I said sergeant, I said, “We up in here. We fighting for our life. We don’t know what what’s going on. We watch the news, we see people dying.” I said, “You mean to tell me since we don’t have a neighbor, a bunkie, we can’t put our stuff on top of the bunk?”</br></br>
I said, “We got rats and roaches up in here.” And she told me, “No you can’t.” And she said, “Where are the rats and roaches?” And that just really let me know that this woman had no, um, no, compassion for us.</br></br>
Because she told us to point out to her rats and roaches and here this is in early in the morning. Everybody knows that if you got rats around, they hide. They only come out at night, for the most part. And that just really let me know what her mind frame was and her whole-body language was. She was just looking at us like we were disgusting. You know?</br></br>UCI: Mhm.</br></br>Caller: And then I just and I feel so dejected right now because I know that in the conditions that we’re in right now, that if an outside agency knew how we’re living right now in this particular moment, that they would be, uh, aghast. That they would, they would, you know, probably have this place shut down right now. You know?</br></br>
If they knew we were up in here freezing cold, water on the floor, no cleaning supplies, and not socially distanced, right now. We’re in a gym, for crying out loud, that leaks. The temperature in here right now is 60 degrees. Cause they got a thermometer on the wall.</br></br>UCI: I’m so sorry to hear that.</br></br>Caller: Yeah, and it, it’s so crowded up in here. Right now, there’s over, I would guesstimate it’s over a hundred and some people in here right now, that’s, um, that’s uh, uh, positive. Um, in fact, it started off, they sent us from our building.</br></br>
Our building has such a major outbreak, I was in building 16. They had such a major outbreak that they cleared the building once, about once, uh, fifteen of us got, got found with the COVID. They cleared the building to decontaminate it.</br></br>And, of course during that event, they end up, uh, the stuff end up jumping to where, uh, you know they’re quarantining, a bunch of other buildings. So, the outbreak is very, very bad here. It’s very, very, very, very bad.</br></br>And, uh, they don’t know what to do. And I’ve been moved twice. The first time from my building. The second time was when I became, when I became positive and moved me to the gym. And, you know, we have no, then they have no compassion for us. You know they have no compassion for us.</br></br>And, you know a lot of my coworkers and stuff. I have strong faith in God. You know? But a lot of my, um, fellow inmates, you know some of those guys are scared. You can see it in their eyes. You know they are absolutely, uh, terrified. You know?</br></br>And for the sergeant to come in here and the way she did this morning, and, uh, come in here and say the things she said, it’s that, that it, it’s, dejected us. You know? Truth is, this might be our last week alive.</br></br>And the women will sit back and have the nerve enough to tell us, we can’t put stuff on the top bunk? And we telling her we have rats and roaches up in here and we don’t want our food and stuff getting ate. And then she said, “Put it in your locker.” I said, “Sergeant, that locker only holds so much. It don’t hold a lot of my property.” You know? I have a lot to take.</br></br>UCI: Mhm.</br></br>Caller: You know? And just, I and, and that’s, that’s why I’m here right now. To try to reach out to somebody. I wish they could have somebody to come to this prison and see the conditions that they got us living in these gyms right now. You know?</br></br>UCI: Thank you so much for telling me about your situation right now. Could you tell me, like walk me back a little in time, from the beginning of the outbreak? And maybe if you could kind of tell me like the different months some of these different major events happened in the facility?</br></br>Caller: So, walking you back, we’ll go back um, 12 days ago. It’s when everything began to hit a head that I knew of. Before? We were just hearing, uh, of isolated situations of people catching COVID.</br></br>
We were having sparse cases, uh, from what I saw. Because if you’re not on that yard or in that building, you don’t get, you don’t get to know what’s going on because when this pandemic first took place, for the last six or seven months, they been making sure that buildings stay separated from other buildings. So, if something happens at building 18, I don’t get to get the full gossip of it because I’m not around any guys who are in building 18, unless I go to work.</br></br>So that was the only time, what they did to make sure to continue the work, they took all the workers. And they moved them off of D yard to C yard, which is the yard that I’m on and put them in one building, which is building 15.</br></br>And then they had a couple workers in 15, a couple in my building. So, um, to answer your question about what was going on in previously, it was sparse breakouts, that I didn’t know that the gravity of the situation because I wasn’t in those yards. But I was hearing that they were having outbreaks, but it was nowhere near as what took place now.</br></br>
So, what did take place is, you hear about two months ago when they shut down San Quentin, as well as a couple other prisons that I didn’t know anything about, I just knew about San Quentin. Uh, we knew that they were either were gonna have to release these individuals at San Quentin or send them to other prisons.</br></br>So we were all excited because there was few of us, such as myself, that, that, that we saw hope that they might let us out instead of, you know, subjecting us to being around, in a crowded environment to where we couldn’t practice social distancing 100 percent of the time.</br></br> So, what I think, what end up happening here was, uh, about two months ago, our, uh, the main, uh, came to us and said, “Hey, I just found out, we just had a meeting with the warden, and they’re going to allow guys that were previously affected from other prisons to come to our prison.”</br></br>And we told them no, but the warden said, “There’s nothing you can do about it. Um, you going to have to be around someone that previously, you know, had been, um, infected.” So-</br></br>We immediately got scared because it’s like, “Oh here we go.” So, the first guy ended up in our building, about a month ago or maybe a month and a half ago. And, uh, I found out through him that yes, he did have COVID-19 and yes, he had caught it twice.</br></br>So, with me finding out that a person can catch it twice, we were just like, “Oh my God.” And so, after that, um, here within these last, you know 12, 13 days, it’s when stuff really hit the fan where it had affected me, where I can actually see the, the gravity of the situation because I’m involved. And when I say this is a major breakout, this is a major breakout. Right now.</br></br>UCI: Mhm.</br></br>Caller: And uh and my, my assessment is- my assessment is they have nowhere to put us. And so, there’s just, um, uh, taking them as they come and just putting us anywhere. Regardless of the conditions.
