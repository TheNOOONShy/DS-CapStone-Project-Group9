This story was told by a person incarcerated at Chuckawalla.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, what do you think specifically theyâ€™ve done wrong, or, you know, how would you do it differently?</br></br> Caller: Keeping the social distancing, keeping us, well let's say, before we got infected, or actually after we got infected that's when we got the N-95, the masks, yeah. They should have given that to us from the very very beginning.</br></br> I know for a fact that there is a memo in the internet that was provided to us and they have a protocol to follow and one of the sections that I remember seeing, reading, is this right there, when a person gets infected, the building- the person gets moved from the building and the whole building does quarantine.</br></br>Well, nothing happened over here. We actually stayed over here and then the two, like I said, two out of five facilities where people were infected. Also it says right there, in the protocol that the staff is not supposed to move from building to building, or from yard to yard. Over here, they are switching from building to building, yard to yard.</br></br>  

You know, over time and stuff like that. When it says right there we no moving staff from that building.
