This story was told by a person incarcerated at Ventura County Main Jail.</br></br>

UCI: What has it been like for you to have reduced programming?</br></br>

Caller: I’ve been on the roof. I feel like with the end of COVID everything's getting better but I only get an hour out a day and it’s random. I like to do it in the morning but I’m waiting till like five o’clock to call you.</br></br>

It’s been very helpful that you reached out to me, it’s been something to hold onto emotionally. I’m always standing at the door or trying to fall asleep. I had like just problems being stuck in a cell.</br></br>

It’s really crazy because I could be found innocent. And I don’t know how the heck it works. Ventura Police Department was not helpful with me.</br></br>

So it feels like – it doesn’t matter. But I wouldn’t have – I never had a story told to me about jail. I don’t think I’ve ever put anybody in jail and I don’t know – I don’t particularly have any jail friends. I have a stepbrother who’s been to jail but he’s nuts. He’s not welcome at my house anymore. So.</br></br>

I really don’t have any comparison. I just wanted to kind of call. You have points – there’s programs. We ate candy yesterday, you can get teeth brushing. You can get bars of soap – there’s two showers. So everything you need to get done is in one hour.</br></br>

But you can’t eat with other people except for your cellmate. So that’s how program is. And there’s also roof time. I went on the roof about three times out of the whole month.
