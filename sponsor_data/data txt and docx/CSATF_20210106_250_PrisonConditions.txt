This letter was written by a person incarcerated at SAFT (California Substance Abuse Treatment Facility and State Prison). </br></br>

Lately w/ this COVID – this year has been fun – at first – I honestly felt like the COVID-19 was B.S. – You know good ole Trump creating a diversion 2 keep the media focused on BS while our government did some underhanded dealings –</br></br> 

I say that because over here in “SATF” – it was business as usual no one doing the distancing – or wearing masks – that was “Hollywood” shit! :) There was no testing at the same time the whole world seemed to be under attack . . .</br></br>

The cold part is the prison started selecting rule changes 2 fuck w/ us – such as no masks yet but no playing sports + prison is 50% sports, soccer, handball, basketball + all the prison based tournaments where a street bum can shine :P these guys can’t hold down a job but can shoot a mean 3 pointer . . . plus no working out on the yard or dayrooms ??</br></br>

Still no types of testing . . . administration was creating a bunch of monsters phone hogs. No contact or behind glass visits w/ our families + girlfriends – a lot of good guys lost their ole ladies behind this crap – believe it or not but some people need + crave that human touch + it allows hope 2 continue 2 grow + w/out it.</br></br>
 
People out there look else where + the men stuck in prison r forced 2 internalize that pain + after a while – we tend to explode or most of us let that inner pain + confusion burn + smolder w/in us until we become a small pile of smelly ashes. We become depressed zombies that took 4 anything 2 self medicate the pain away. . . then there’s the few of us that know about the struggles + pain of solitary confinement . . . SHU Time – I’ve been a validated member of a disruptive group + did 6 years C facility Pelican Bay.</br></br>

So those few of us tend 2 stick 2gether . .  praying that they creators will continue 2 bless us w/ the strength 2 not give up all hope . . . it’s a survival of the fittest of who gets on the phones lately + the COs love it . . .</br></br>
