This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Theo Lacy. </br></br>Dear PrisonPandemic,</br></br>I am in good health, and it’s been difficult, specially that I have to go to trial in August and then again another trial in September. My experiences are very serious. So during the past year, I’ve gotten to been under strict lock down quarantine and social distancing and tests.</br></br>I’ve gotten to be housed at the main in A-B-C-D-E-F mods. I’ve gotten several new tattoos done in main. When my new court appearance in August, I’ll have been incarcerated for over eight years. Seven in county and one year in San Bernardino Patton.</br></br>Before the pandemic I got visits from my dad and mom each coming every other weekend. So my mom one weekend and my dad the next. So that was going on for a couple of years. I’ve been sober for some time and I do not gamble at all.</br></br>I was one of the first in here in Theo Lacy to get vaccinated and receive the Johnson & Johnson. After I got vaccinated I received a big headache and was hot and cold throughout the night. Now before the pandemic, I was doing all sorts of privileged programs, computer classes, and escape classes groups of all I could do every week.</br></br>They ended up housing people that were infected with people not infected. Now I’m a privileged Peckerwood, and American Indian Apache. I’ve been through a lot and still are every day.</br></br>I’ve had a lot of publicity in the news media and paper articles and so much power inside the O.C. county systems. I am still going to and fighting my case out of New Port Harbor. I am fighting a homicide of 26 to life.</br></br>I am not a gang member or sex offender and am on my first and only violent case. I’ve only done what I’ve done bec/z it’s do it to them or have it done to me for the wood pile.</br></br>They have been cruel to us and “negligence”. They do to the minimum only and classification cells you up with good people or a really bad person, and they don’t care and tell us to fight each other or to get along. I want to advance my careers and benefit in education and financially.</br></br>The first thing that happened which I feel really drew me close to the Lord was prayers from my folks and from my friends who do know Christ. They have been behind me ever since I got into this trouble. They never have left me and they’ve always been right by my side, praying for me.</br></br>After what I’ve been through and the things I’ve been associated with, that I could come back into a good life, a happy life, where I’d be loved, where other folks could love you, and where there would be people in the free world who cared about me and prayed for me and looked for the day when I’d be restored to freedom so I can life a good American worthwhile life.</br></br> So for the longest time since we went on lockdown quarantine, we’ve been eating poorly, like meat sandwiches three times a day for just about the whole pandemic.</br></br>Now last June and July, the whole jail of homies and woods and others went on a hunger strike for about six days. That was my first hunger strike and I received two major disciplinary write ups for the first time.</br></br>So there’s always count time and medication call couple times a day. In the jail, we are always cleaning minimum once or more a day every in the morning. In this Nr mod, we went on lockdown quarantine on December 10th and we were only allowed 30 minute day room for phone or showers and that lasted a couple of months.</br></br>Now I can’t explain too much or any part of my case but you can look me up my news or paper articles as much as possible. I’m being charged with an axe slaying of my stepmom.</br></br>I want to do anything and everything possible for myself that produces fruitful characteristics. Now I’ll be 29 in August. And single, no kids, and am like the greatest gentlemen ever.</br></br>So when they test us, they check our temperature, ask us if we have any symptoms and nose swab. They continued doing these tests everyday around eight or so in the morning.</br></br>Now jail has been more violent than even the outside world. Our well-being is the least issue the cops worrisome. I’ve been through some of the most violent cases than I’ve ever experienced inside.</br></br>I’ve been through and seen over 40 inmates commit suicidal tendencies my first 40 months in jail. Some successfully kill themselves and most are saved. Drugs are real.</br></br>I wasn’t able to appeal or go to court for a long time, and I have no bail since 2018. I have no choice but to move forward.</br></br>So I found out my sister got COVID. I feared my mom would get sick also. There’s nothing I could do for any of my family, that was the most painful experience. They did quarantine and live through it.</br></br>My mom and my dad I talk to every day on the phone, and just recently visits in the jail opened up and I appeared to video court, a couple times recently.</br></br>Every day I searched the mind and heart and open myself to the inspiration and word of God. Blessed Thy we are good, good Thy we are blessed. Anyone and everyone can write to me, I’ll always write back. God bless us all.</br></br>Sincerely.
