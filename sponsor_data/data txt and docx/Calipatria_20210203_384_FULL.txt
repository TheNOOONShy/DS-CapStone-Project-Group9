Greetings PrisonPandemic,</br></br>

I am happy to have received your letter of concerns. First let me answer your question in regards of the pandemic and the effect it has on us prisoners.</br></br>

How does it feel to be inside at this time? It is psychologically distressing. How do you feel about your safety inside? The safety of my health is in imminent danger. What has it been like to reduced visitation from family and love ones? It’s very heartbreaking and we’re in exigent need of help.</br></br> 

How have you been coping with this crisis? Trying to keep mental harmony under this 24-hour cell living with no disinfectant and uncontrollable spread within this facility.</br></br>

I would like to thank you and your peers for this concerning project that has a focal point on us prisoners that have us voice. May god be with you and your family. Hope to hear from you soon.</br></br>

Sincerely.
