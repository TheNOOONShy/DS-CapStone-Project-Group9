This story was told by a person incarcerated at San Bernardino Central Detention Center.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, feel free to share any - any stories you have related to COVID-19 and your condition.</br></br>

Caller: Okay. This is the closest I've been to anybody since COVID started. I live in a sailboat off in the desert by myself, away from people. I go to town every morning at 7:00.</br></br>

I get my groceries. I call in my order. They put it in a box and set it out front.</br></br>

I pay for it with my credit card order online, and they would hand me - leave my box out front when they saw me pull up. They would sit it out front, and I would go grab my box and take it home.</br></br>

This is the closest I've been to anybody since COVID started. It is quite shocking to me. I'm in SM - and that's serious mental illness.</br></br>

I don't know why I'm here, but my background that I have. But I do know we just came off of quarantine on Thursday. There are no masks forced - enforced in this pod.</br></br>

Two weeks ago, when we were placed on quarantine, we were complaining that our toilet was backed up, and we needed help getting it cleaned out. We have three toilets, and they were filled to the brim with poop. I went to the nurse and complained to them that that was the condition and people were pooping.</br></br> 

We were sick, sick, sick in here. I don't know what we have, but everybody was sick, and we were pooping in the shower. That was the only place that wasn't left to go.</br></br>

We are being malnourished. We are not being fed appropriately from the jail. The jail likes us to fight and treats us like lions in a den, and they like to use us as free entertainment.</br></br>

If we're in a fight and beat up, which I was by five people, they don't do anything for you. I wasn't seen until September from my September beating, and I was taken to Arrowhead. I - my bone was sticking out, protruding, compound fractures, and they told me that I wasn't fractured at all.</br></br>

I've got 12 years EMT training, and I ride on a meat wagon. I'm pretty darn sure I've broken bones. I can't lift my right arm anymore.</br></br>

I also broke some teeth, and I got to see the dentist today for the first time for that issue. They're telling me that my teeth are rotten now, and they have to pull them all out. My dentist was warning me about this before it came in.</br></br>

I had his - an endo scheduled, and I had some inbed scheduled for May 2019, hit and run, and I had that all scheduled. There's no possible way I would have committed a crime and would up in this jail, in this horrible - that I'm in.</br></br>

I've been in worse conditions, and that alone is even worse when they shipped me down to - and the only time I'm forced to wear a mask is when I go out the gate and go to a meeting or go to the dentist like I did today, and then I had to go to the dentist to wear my mask, wash out my mouth with peroxide, and put my mask back on, so the dentist can come and look at me, and have me open - lower my mask, lower my mouth, and he would look at my teeth, and then told me what he was gonna pull out my teeth.</br></br>

My dentist has already told me you're not gonna be able to eat once we do this. So, they had me scheduled for endos and other surgeries to have on my mouth, and I have to do them once every so often. They had to reschedule and I didn't make it to any of those things.</br></br>

I also had a spinal surgery that I was awaiting for the May 2019 hit and run. That has been just completely crushed. The damage that I've received on September, I don't even know if we can fix it anymore, and I fear I'm close to being in a wheelchair.</br></br>

That's pretty much what my story is. I wrote it all down in my notebook here for you. I found your piece of paper on the floor the other day and wrote down the numbers, and I don't know who that was too, but it wasn't to me, and I just wanted to make this contact with you to let you know that there is a horrible condition going on in the unit, and the sheriff seems to be in cahoots with the Riverside sheriff from what I read in the newspaper.</br></br>

And cops are crooked. That's all I know. I don't know how I got here.</br></br>

I haven't committed any crimes. I guess that's all I've got.</br></br>

UCI: Alright, well, thank you so much for sharing.</br></br>

Caller: Okay, thank you.</br></br>

UCI: And for participating in our project.</br></br>

Caller: I used to be a popular person. Like I said, I designed the '86. I won the street of dreams in Long Beach in '85.</br></br>

I lived here four years as a military contractor while I was an architect. I went up North and worked in Seattle for some time, and as civil engineering came after I graduated from computer-aided drafting, top of the my class, 4.0, dean's list, perfect attendance, job search award. I was the only one in the class to get the job search award.</br></br>

And for some reason, I've risked all that over some bull crap that I'm in here with and don't understand. I have yet to meet my lawyer, and I came in here on August. I don't' know what my lawyer's name is.</br></br>

I've never spoke to that lawyer. Supposed to be public defender out of Victorville, and I don't even know how to contact those people.</br></br>

I don't get to go to court until October. And it is probably delayed they're telling me three more months because of COVID and the problem in the quarantine we just had that's gonna be delayed. And they'll reschedule that sometime down the road, and I'm sure that I'm just gonna have a heart attack when they tell me it is going to be longer.</br></br>

My sailboat is at risk. My dogs are gone. My cats are gone.</br></br> 

My partners' dead. Growing vegetables for the winter, and all of that stuff is gone. I have no idea where my animals left and went to. They weren't able to fend for themselves.</br></br>

Nobody thought to lock up my property, so whoever's going through my camper is just serving me up royal. I did have my boat locked up. I have a 25-foot sailboat that I won at an auction, and right here the people are trying to take advantage and take that sailboat now and make it their own.</br></br>

So I'm not gonna have a thing left when I get out of here, if I do get out of here, and I'm just considering ending my life while I'm here. Thanks for your time.</br></br>

UCI: So, unfortunately.
