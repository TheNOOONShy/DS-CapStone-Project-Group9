This story was told by a person incarcerated at Los Angeles County Men’s Central Jail.</br></br>

UCI: Okay. I understand. And how have you been coping with the pandemic?</br></br>

Caller: How have I been cop- I mean it's kind of depressing. Because we can't really do much no more. We can't really go to a program. </br></br>

Or like – or get showers no more. We don't get disinfectant no more. They don't pass out disinfectant.</br></br>

So we have to clean ourselves. They don't give us shampoo like they used to before. It affects us real greatly.</br></br>

Because they don't give us as much stuff as they used to give us before – like hygiene material, disinfectant – all that. Which we should have coming. But they do not give it to us.</br></br>

UCI: And did that begin at the beginning of the pandemic or has that like started to happen in the middle?</br></br>

Caller: No. That's been going - no, that's been going on for years. But it got worser. It's been – now, they use that to their advantage because the pandemic, basically. So that – that like they see an excuse - an excuse for them to not give us what we got coming.</br></br>

UCI: So you feel like they're - they're withholding products from you?</br></br>

Caller: Well, yeah. They've been doing that for years. Because, like I said, I don't want to say my name. But it's because me and - me and another prisoner – we're like high profiles.</br></br>

And so they kind of treat us different. And they're - they say it's for their safety. But we don't - we don't do nothing. We're just regular inmates who want to get by.</br></br>

We want a mask, we want a mask. Why can't we get masks or why can't our family bring us masks but every other inmate could get a mask and their families could bring a mask. But, when it comes to two certain inmates, which is me and my neighbor, they don't allow us to get no disinfectant, no masks.</br></br>

They treat us totally different. And it's kind of like, oh, for – okay, for what? So they use the pandemic more as an excuse not to give us stuff that we got coming. So they do what - they do owe a lot of things to give us.
