This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Tehachapi.</br></br>

For me it's been somewhat the same for years. Within these walls it has gotten restrictive with movements and interactions with others as preventative measures. Limits were put on resources, due to the demand and limitations on the outside world. Units were cancelled completely with no access to loved ones due to the sickness.</br></br> 

But for me the things mentioned have been common for me to be used to in some sense. Being incarcerated for 20 years, prison years from the past had the same things going on except the sickness. Year-long lockdown or more, no visits, phone calls then no resources or movements of any kind. Straight confinement to cell living. I became accustomed to that style of life.
