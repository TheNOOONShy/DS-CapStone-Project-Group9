This story was told by a person incarcerated at Calipatria.</br></br>

UCI: Right, I understand. Have you found any coping mechanisms to deal with this? I mean I’m sure it’s very hard to not talk to your family for over a year.</br></br>

Caller: I haven’t seen, I’ve been able to talk to ‘em. I’ve been able to talk to ‘em. I wasn’t, not sayin’ I wasn’t able to talk to them at all, I’ve been able to talk to ‘em. But actually see them and stuff like that, that’s hard yeah but you gotta, luckily you have a lil’ small support system for letters and you try to read and I cope with it like that.</br></br> 

But at the same time it’s like, we’re in, a lot of laws had recently just got passed for CDC for what we’re supposed to have. Be out of our cells longer and go have more yard, have more day room, and there were restrictions about how long we could be on lockdown, where it couldn’t be longer than 14 days. But now all that stuff is going out the window.</br></br>

So now we’re back to the same old things. We don’t have nothin’ to do, we’re just sittin’ here. You guys are not runnin’ no programs, you’re not rehabilitating anyone, you’re not rolling no staff programs, you’re not runnin’ no groups, you’re not runnin’ no nothing to actually rehabilitate people.</br></br> 

We’re just sitting here doing dead time. Nobody’s gettin’ milestone credits, nobody’s gettin’ things to earn time off, nobody’s learning any trade, we’re just sitting here, we’re just stuck.
