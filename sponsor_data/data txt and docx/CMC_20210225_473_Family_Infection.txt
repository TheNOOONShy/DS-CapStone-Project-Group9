This letter was written by a person incarcerated at CMC (California Men's Colony).</br></br>Since I’ve been incarcerated, I've lost my mother, my father, my brother, and several cousins. On top of all that then comes COVID-19. I stay to myself as much as I can and hardly go outside, a choice of my own. The only way any inmate could ever catch COVID-19 is by way of staff who work in the prison. We haven’t been allowed any visits for at least a year now so how else could we test positive for COVID-19.</br></br> 

Please don’t misunderstand me, I in no way blame any human being for this seriously sad sickness that has plagued our earth. It is what it is sad to say, I also can't wrap my head around the fact that there isn’t yet a vaccine that has been FDA approved, but those of them in power say we must get vaccinated. Here at CMC, medical has been offering vaccine shots to all who will take it.</br></br> 

At the same time, the paper work given to the population about the vaccine clearly states that it is not FDA approved and it also says all the side effects that may happen. It’s all way too much for me, I am a heart patient and I do not play around with medications or my health.
