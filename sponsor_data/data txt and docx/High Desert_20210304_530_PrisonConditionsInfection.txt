This letter was written by a person incarcerated at High Desert.</br></br>As far as COVID, well the way the prison manage the situation was a mess. I don’t have to see the real world to see what the prison did wrong. First of all, the COs blame medical, medical blame the COs.</br></br>I can see the news. The government did it wrong too.</br></br>The first time someone got sick in building five, they should have lock down the whole building for 10 days. But no! Their idea was to start moving every individual that had any symptoms. That only spread COVID everywhere in the prison.</br></br> Then, they put in another inmate inside the cell. Where the sick person was just in, without cleaning the cell. So that person that was not sick now is sick.</br></br>Like always CDC threaten you with a 115 if you don’t want to move. Or, if you don’t want to accept someone in your cell. They don’t know, they don’t care if he is sick or not.</br></br>These went on for about 70 days. In those 70 days, we had no information about anything. We had no store, no phones, no programs, no work. Nothing.</br></br>I supposedly got sick. Yet, the first day they said there was a sick person in the building, me and my celly stayed inside the cell. We did not come out at all. But medical was forcing everyone to take their vital. They were touching everyone with the same pair of gloves. So, that is how I know by common sense. They spread it to everyone.</br></br>It really seem as if they were doing this thing on purpose. To get everyone sick. It made no sense to do that. It made no sense to start moving people that were sick to A, C, D yard, spreading COVID to every yard. That was not smart.</br></br>Unless that was the idea. To spread COVID to every yard. Maybe the prison got COVID relief money for every case?</br></br>Then again, COVID did nothing to me. But I am the type of person that does not expect to heal without doing nothing on my part.</br></br>I eat healthy. I exercise. I am aware of all my surroundings. A lot of the people that still got side effects, breathing problems, etc., they are overweight. They eat too much, don’t exercise enough, and share stuff with others.</br></br> So yes, there was nothing some of us could do. When the prison forces you to cell up with someone that had COVID or put us inside a cell without cleaning it, when the last person had COVID.</br></br> But I can clean the cell myself. Eat healthy. Exercise. And not share things with people.</br></br>A lot of the prison population has received the second shot against COVID. I received the first.</br></br> I don’t take shot usually. But seen how things are, I am taking this one. That way I won’t get excluded from participating on the regular program. Whenever it opens up.
