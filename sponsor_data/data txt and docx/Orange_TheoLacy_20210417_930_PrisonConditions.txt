I'm currently incarcerated here at Theo Lacy Facility, I have been here since September 2019, so I was here when the pandemic started. Yes, it has been a long and frustrating situation. At first, they took away our visits, then they took away our hot breakfast meals, replaced with cold sack lunch, nasty hardboiled eggs that have been frozen and you can tell that they are far from being fresh.</br></br>Then they took away our hot dinner meals, replaced with frozen meat packets. These hot meals replacements happened around October/November 2020, so this day we still get three cold sack lunches a day. Very frustrating and if you don't have money in here to buy food from commissary then you have no choice but to eat these frozen sack meals. I'm so tired of not having hot food, it's a big toll physically and especially mentally.</br></br>On top of that and not having visits plus all of the other things it makes you want to give up, I'm physically and mentally drained.
