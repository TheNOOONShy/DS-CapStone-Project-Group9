Dear UCI project for the PrisonPandemic!</br></br>

I am 69 1/2 years old with COPD, 1/2 of a lung removed three years ago, heart problems, high blood pressure, rheumatoid arthritis, heavily medicated weakening my immune system. In prison for 13 1/2 years.</br></br>

In response to your letter for information on how the COVID-19 pandemic is affecting prisoners here at California Institution for Men prison at Chino California.</br></br>

I am very grateful for ANY help that you can assist me with. As the facts may be that presently I have completed my habeas corpus petition for dismissal of my conviction. And motion for recall of conviction/judgement because of fraud upon the court by false sheriff report and testimony by the detective in 2006-2008 resulting in the detective being fired in 2009 = two months after I went to prison, but, not disclosed to the court to this day by the prosecution.</br></br> 

He has stated that he was fired for too much trouble with the courts. He also failed to disclose a different perpetrator that was also being investigated at the same time that he was investigating me for the same crimes, which I have received a declaration from.</br></br>

He told and promised the accusing witnesses that he would give them their immigration papers after the trial was over for their testimony as he and the prosecution team required before preliminary hearing, trial, and sentencing = that I have documents to verify.</br></br>

Prosecution has failed to disclose false evidence to convict. False sheriff report submitted on 2006, and of a non-existence witness stated in that report in a meeting on 2007 that did not accrue, the prosecution allowed him to testify as what the non-existent witness said in his investigation.</br></br> 

But, has been unable to produce the witness to this day. He altered his sheriff report after my arrest 2007 and preliminary hearing 2007 on 2007. Because of my Brady discover motion 2007 and falsely testified at trial, resulting in him being fired. My new motion for post-conviction discovery is requesting this required disclosure.</br></br>

I am also submitting a discovery sanction motion and discovery fraud upon the court with 92 pages of newly presented evidence of fraud upon the courts by the prosecution, and failure to correct the knowing use of false evidence in order to gain or secure a conviction. My final step is to get copies made to submit to the court and prosecution as required.</br></br> 

But under this pandemic for the COVID-19 virus the law library requires all of my paper work for the copies for all the court to be mailed in through institutional mail, that, I have had experience in the recent past of being lost or thrown away? The only copies of my new evidence. The warden and the Attorney General are the "respondents" in my habeas corpus proceedings.</br></br>

I have been waiting to personally go into the law library myself and to wait for the return of my copies immediately since August 11th, 2020.</br></br>

But the policies of the prison is that if your level of 100 prisoners has one person come down with the positive test for the virus - even though he does not show symptoms of the virus or has the virus, my whole 100 prisoners are quarantined for 21 days. And during this time if another person tests positive in the 100 persons you are quarantined for another 21 days.</br></br> 

This has been occurring since August 11, 2020 to this day not allowing me to get copies for the court and prosecution even though I have not been tested positive. I need a lawyer to submit my legal documents for secured access to the courts.</br></br>

Because the prison is constantly bringing in new prisoners that are infected to fill the vacant cells and stopping me from ever getting off quarantine. Denying me access to the law library since August 11, 2020!!!</br></br>

I should not be required to give up the only copy of the new evidence that will require me to be dismissed from prison, for two weeks in the prison mail system that is not adequate to secure return of my legal papers, from the people that I am facing in those legal papers?</br></br> 

This policy is denying/restricting me from access to the court's filing of my legal petition and motions. My case in 2007-2008 in County Superior Court has bad accusation charges for inappropriate touchings counts #1, 2, 3, 4, 5 under lewd and lascivious acts resulting in four to 15 years to life sentences consecutively; see penal code 667.61.</br></br> 

And for counts #6 and #7 for allegedly occurring on the same incident which is multiple charges for the same incident under lewd and lascivious acts, after the accusing witness has changed her original sheriff report six years earlier from attempted touching to rape and sodomy only after talking to the detective that has promised her - her immigration papers for her require by the prosecution testimony - all of which has not been disclosed to the court or me to this day.</br></br>

The accusing witnesses have received their promised before trial immigration papers as I have documents now to show to the court, but I need to keep a copy of for any appeal that I might need to file later.</br></br>

The accusing witnesses "applications" for the immigration papers states that the detective promised them their immigration papers for their change in testimony to the preliminary hearing and the trial court.</br></br> 

Under Bell v. Bell, 460 F.3d 739, (6th Cir. February 2, 2006); and Bell v. Bell, 512 F.3d223 (6th cir. 2008) require the disclosure of "a tacit agreement", before trial or a dismissal of conviction because it is a fraud upon the court or failure to disclose a favor or reward for inducement of testimony to the court; United States v. Bagley, 473 U.S.667, 1055.ct.3375 (1985); Giglio v. United States, 405 U.S.150, 154,31L.Ed2d104, 92 S.cT.763 (19972); Jackson v. Brown, 513F.3d1057 (9th Cir.2008) rewards and inducements undisclosed = fraud; United States v. Howell, 231F.3d615 (9th circ. 2000), a false sheriff report must be disclosed. In Figueroa (2018) 4 cal.5th app. 576,592 [299Cal.RPTR.3d673,412p.3d356] quoting "false evidence used to convict - a lower tolerance for a wrong FULL conviction = "a lie is a lie" Hayes V. Brown, 399 F.3d 972,978 (9th cir. 2005)(en banc) ID. at 399F.3d at 984,985,974,978,982 "reversal is automatic", and "a lie is a lie".</br></br> 

I have always stated that I did not do these crimes. No evidence that these crimes ever occurred. Only the accusing witnesses paid for testimony that is now supported by the applications for the immigration papers that have been given for their false testimony. This is not the law.</br></br> 

On April 25, 2020, I talked to one of the accusing witnesses on the prison phone that is always being recorded, where the witness admitted being promised by the detective by immigration papers for testimony before my arrest-preliminary hearing - trial - and sentencing hearings that has not been disclosed to the court to this day.</br></br> 

I now know where to get the tacit agreement verification evidence that will entitle me to a dismissal of my conviction in more than three different places. A lawyer would expedite this process. The law library COVID-19 procedure called paging requires a lawyer to send me a request for my legal papers - before they will make copies to be sent to the lawyer by me?</br></br>

This requires someone to refer my case to a lawyer so that he will send a letter to me for the library to make a copy for me to send to the lawyer? The brother of the accusing witness has sent me a declaration that on or before 12-2007 that the accusing witness stated to him that he promised the accusing witnesses their immigration papers for their trial testimony. But that they would have to wait until after they testified at trial and the trial was over before they could receive their immigration papers that has not been disclosed to this day to the court or to me.</br></br> 

A fraud upon the court and me denying me a fair trial because of that fraud. Dismissal of my conviction is required under the law.</br></br>

This restrictive "paging" procedure requiring me to give up ALL of my newly presented evidence for two weeks to the respondents workers with a history of loosing legal paper work is unconstitutional and restricts access to filing to the courts.</br></br>

Any assistance or help that you are able to help me with is greatly appreciated, I really don't want to wait until next August 2021 after receiving the COVID-19 virus immunization shot to be able to go into the law library for copies of my exhibits new evidence and subpoena for the accusing witnesses to bring into to the court their applications for the immigration cards allowing them to stay in the U.S., that was prepared by their immigration lawyer.</br></br>

I will try to call you. Thank you for any help that you are able to assist me with. I will be waiting for a response from you.
