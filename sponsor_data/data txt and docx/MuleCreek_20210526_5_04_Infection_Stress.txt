This story was told by a person incarcerated at Mule Creek.</br></br>

Caller: I took the shots and then for two days, I had the chills and sweating. And after that, I had them. And then I went back to get medical and all of a sudden this rain rolls in, and I got the chill back again.</br></br> 

So, I’ve had the chills three times on that thing, but I’m old. I’m 77 years old.</br></br>
 
Well, with the pandemic, when we have all the different places in the different pods, right? And when somebody got sick, they would send them in where, to tables where everybody was- were healthy and they’d try to put them in there and get them all sick and then they’d get sick and they’d have to go somewhere else. It’s kinda weird. Hello?</br></br>

UCI: How has the vaccination situation been like at your facility?</br></br>

Caller: They did everybody already. They had everybody. And we had all kinds of, it’s in a prison, you know, so they just had everybody doing it.</br></br>

We had one, the one girl that takes blood from the inmates, she didn’t wanna take the thing but she does all the blood for them. But she doesn’t say that she wants, she didn’t took no virus. She didn’t want no part of it, no shots. I thought that was kind of odd. It’s a little scary.</br></br>

UCI: How have you been coping with everything?</br></br>

Caller: Pretty good. We’re doing pretty good on the virus part so far. We wouldn’t mind going on the third group but we had the early ones earlier like three months ago we had them.</br></br>

So, we had them, everybody got in a line, so everybody had the chance to take the pill, I mean, taking the, what do you call it? The shots, so we all had the shots. But we’ve had sick people go to different places in the gym and stuff like that, but they’ll put them all together. Kinda weird the way they do that.</br></br>

UCI: How has reduced visitation affected you?</br></br>

Caller: How does it affect me?</br></br>

UCI: Yes.</br></br>

Caller: Well, I was worried about when I first got the virus’ shots, it scared me. But that’s it, the way, I been on good, pretty good of it. But I’m old, remember? 77.
