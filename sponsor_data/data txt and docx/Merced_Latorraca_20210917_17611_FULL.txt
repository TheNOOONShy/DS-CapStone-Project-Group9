This story was told by a person incarcerated at John Latorraca Correctional Center.</br></br>

UCI: Okay. And tell me a little bit about how the COVID situation has been like at your facility.</br></br>

Caller: Well, basically, everything is, like, locked down here. We have no type of - well, they say we don't have no contact with other people, but we still walk the same yard, talk to the same COs and stuff like that. So, I really don't know how that's quarantine or not, but that's what they're doing here.</br></br>

UCI: Mmhmm.</br></br>

Caller: And the reason I'm calling is because, the main thing is, like, the visits and the court system.</br></br> 

UCI: Mmhmm.</br></br>

Caller: The facility, I guess, it's all right. It's doing what it has to do, I guess, to maintain, I guess, how do you say it? The quarantine or their job as safely as they can. I mean, I know our safety and their safety is the most important thing, right? Safety first.</br></br>

UCI: Mmhmm.</br></br>

Caller: But when it comes to our visits, and then with everything, like, upcoming, like you know, everything is like running right now. And I don't understand why we can't get visits even though we're facilitated to have behind the glass. I mean, we have a phone. Even before this started, we had visits and the glass, no contact. </br></br> 

And I'm like, why can't we have our visits? There's some of us that are gonna go to prison, and then the prison is not letting us have visits. And that's like six years of saying we can't see nobody. That's kind of like, you know, we're not animals. We do have loved ones.</br></br>

We do have families that, you know, we're not cold cut killers. Well, I mean, there might be some here, but I'm, most of us aren't. I mean, that's bothering me because there's incidents in prison already, that it's been shutting down that, I mean, people have killed themselves in prison already because of this. From not being able to visit their family.</br></br>

UCI: Mmhmm.</br></br>

I mean, it's crazy in here because we don't know nobody to begin with when we come in here. I mean, everybody is a stranger. I mean how - I'm not going to open up to nobody and talk to them. They're not going to give me the same comfort my family is.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: And they're denying us that. And it's bothering me, and I'm trying to, I'm doing it the legal - like, the right way. I'm not doing anything crazy. I'm, you know, I'm pushing in the paperwork and I'm doing it by their rules, and I still can't get no, I can't get nothing done.</br></br> 

UCI: Mmhmm.</br></br>

They just keep on bypassing me and bypassing me and I'm like, I mean "Who do I need to talk to?" And everybody gives the same answer. "We don't know. We'll get back at you later."</br></br> 

It's been going on for a month now and I still don't get no - I mean, I even asked for paperwork on, like, what is their procedure on this? And all I got was a printout saying that you can't turn in no grievances and you have to wait until later.</br></br> 

I was like what kind of, that's not no - That's nothing to do with, I mean, they're just telling me not to put no grievance in. They're not telling me why and how and what study or who said that we can't have visits.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: And what grounds? I mean, are you guys keeping us from the street? And then the court system, it's even more horrible because they're trying to make us talk to our lawyers over these phones that record.</br></br> 

I mean, and taking our confidentiality -</br></br> 

UCI: Mmhmm.</br></br>

Caller: - between us and the lawyers away. I mean, how are we supposed to talk to our lawyers when we know the DA, the cops are all listening to us?</br></br>

Because it says it is on the beginning of the phone call. And they listen to it because of safety reasons, but at the same time, I mean, where's our rights at?</br></br>

UCI: Mmhmm.</br></br>

Caller: So, like, that's why I was calling, it's kind of crazy that it's making it okay for them to do this right now.</br></br>

Just because a couple things are sick, I mean, this facility to have contact visits - not contact, I mean behind the glass visits. And to have video cameras like that Zoom or whatever it's called. Whatever it's called. To get visits, because they do the court system like that.</br></br>

UCI: Mmhmm.</br></br>

Caller: I don't even leave the facility to go to court.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah. And so, this must have been a big change from before the pandemic started, I'm guessing?</br></br>

Caller: Before the pandemic started, we had visits behind the glass. Like, we were quarantined anyways, already, before this. There's no contact at all, whatsoever. We had to pick up a phone, like I am talking to you right now, dial a number.</br></br>

And then our family was on a different - a big piece of glass on the other side and they had to pick up the phone and answer it like we're doing right now. And all the calls were recorded. And I mean, I mean, that's fair enough with me.</br></br> 

I mean, I got to see them and I got to talk to them. And then they want to give us a five-minute phone call once a week, which, I mean, I'm sorry, but when somebody's going through it, five minutes ain't enough time.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: That's barely enough to say, "How are you doing?" Answer real quick. And then, sometimes some people need to get deep into a conversation, just to get a little bit of ease. And it's not enough.</br></br> 

When our neighboring counties are giving us Zoom, video chat, and all that. Little tablets. They're giving alternative methods to contact your family over there.</br></br>  

UCI: Mmhmm.</br></br> 

Caller: But for some odd reason, this county ain't doing it.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah. And what has it been like for you with reduced visitation and all?</br></br>

Caller: Excuse me?</br></br>

UCI: What has it been like for you with reduced visitation and programming?</br></br>

Caller: I would like to see my wife and have a little supportive over - I can't even see her when I go to court. I have to be honest, I'm in front of a little tablet and that's it.</br></br>

UCI: Mmhmm.</br></br>

Caller: I see the judge and my lawyer and that's it. And then my lawyer won't even come down here and see me.</br></br>

UCI: Mmhmm.</br></br>

Caller: He wants me to call him over the phone.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah. And how have you been coping with the crisis?</br></br>

Caller: It's - I mean, I've been trying to figure this out. Because, they want me to do five years here in county, and they expect me to be here for five years without seeing my family? That's pretty tough right there.</br></br> 

I mean, I mean, what did my family do? Because that's who they're making suffer the most. They're not just making me suffer, they're making my family suffer. Because we're not - my family is doing time with me.</br></br>

And then that little bit of, I mean, I say, I know at the end, it's my fault that I'm here. Well, not really it's my fault because I'm still an open case. And I really don't think I'm really here for my fault, but anyway, that's a whole different matter.</br></br>

But I mean, I'm not - I'm charged with something. I haven't been convicted of nothing. I'm not on probation, I'm not on parole, nothing.</br></br> 

UCI: Mmhmm.</br></br>

Caller: They just picked me up some charges and they accused me of something because of my past.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: So, that's why I'm here. And I don't understand why I'm getting so, like, treated like I murdered somebody or something like that.</br></br>

UCI: Mmhmm.</br></br>

Caller: When I'm not - I'm like I'm not even a violent offender or nothing like that. I have no violence in my background or my history. Why are they keeping me away from my family when the same COs that watch us go to the same gas stations that my family does?</br></br> 

Eat at the same restaurants? And our kids go to the same schools and they use the same freeways.</br></br>

UCI: Mmhmm.</br></br>

Caller: Why can't they come over and see us real quick?</br></br>

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: Like I don't understand.</br></br>

UCI: Mmhmm.</br></br>

Caller: And there's a lot of us in here, like, feel the same way I do, but most people, they're too intimidated by the cops. Because it's not so much things are pushing up on us, but they think that they're going to get more in trouble for voicing their opinions.</br></br>

UCI: Mmhmm.</br></br>

Caller: So, that's why I'm calling.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: Maybe when they'll hear us, and maybe when somebody that can do something, cause I write you a letter and you said that you can't. Right? You know? Step up and be like, "Hey, let's go check out Merced County real quick."</br></br>

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: "See if we could, you know, get them their visits or something." Somebody would, that can do it. Or maybe they could protest.</br></br>

Not protest, but just call up county and say, "Hey, what's up? I mean, everything is just running. Why can't you guys get the visits?"</br></br> 

We're facilitated for it. We have chemicals to kill the germs. There's nobody in here with that anyways right now. Well, at least that's what they told us.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah. And is there anything else you want people to know about your experience?</br></br>

Caller: Excuse me?</br></br>

UCI: Is there anything else you want people to know about your experience?</br></br>

Caller: Oh, what's going on right now?</br></br>

UCI: Is there anything else, yeah, about what's going on right now, and anything else you would like to share?</br></br>

Caller: Just the visits and the court system, how it's working right now. It's just, it's horrible.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: It's not right, and I don't think it's justifiable, what's they're doing. Now maybe if the whole state was, or the whole country was on lockdown and doing everything through Zoom and all that. Which we still, we don't even have the option to do that.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: Then, okay. But everything is up and running. Even the president said everything opened up. Why can't this facility open up, then?</br></br> 

I mean, are they just being too lazy or is it the governor? Or who? I don't understand. What is it? Why can't we be running like everything else, back to normal?</br></br>

UCI: Mmhmm.</br></br>

Caller: My kids are going to school. Why can't my family come visit me?</br></br>

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: So, you see, you see where the problem at? So, I mean, I'm not asking them to let me go or anything like that. I just, the president said everything is up and running. Go for it. It's okay.</br></br>

But they're not letting us visit our family. I mean, who has to give the okay? The president already gave the okay. What more do they want?</br></br>

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: So, that's pretty much it. The visits. It's horrible. I mean, imagine? I'm gonna be here for five years and they said I can't visit, can't see my family.</br></br>

UCI: Mmhmm. Yeah, I hear you.</br></br>

Caller: It seems like they're running on their own laws or something here.</br></br>

UCI: Mmhmm.</br></br>

Caller: So, other than that, other than that, I mean, the facility is all right.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah. Well, thank you very much for participating in PrisonPandemic and please consider telling your friends about us and seeing if they would like to call in.</br></br>

Caller: Excuse me?</br></br>

UCI: Oh, thank you for participating in PrisonPandemic and please consider telling your friends about us and seeing if they would like to call in.</br></br>

Caller: Oh, I will. Hey, where are you guys located at? What university?</br></br>

UCI: University - UCI.</br></br>

Caller: Is that here in California?</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, it's in Irvine.</br></br>

Caller: Oh, okay. UCI. I think I was going to go there one time. Yeah, I was getting my, and then - what was I studying? Electronics. I was gonna go for electronics.</br></br>

UCI: Mmhmm.</br></br>

Caller: But anyway, that's a whole different thing. All right. Thank you for listening and I hope somebody listens to this.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, of course.</br></br>

Caller: How would - hey, how would you be able to listen to the people that talk about this?</br></br>

UCI: I'm sorry?</br></br>

Caller: What would you - like on the internet, what would you go under to listen to these things?</br></br>

UCI: We do have a website. It's prisonpandemic.uci.edu.</br></br>

Caller: Oh, it's the one that's on there, on the paper?</br></br>

UCI: Yeah. Mmhmm.</br></br>

Caller: And what, you just look it up and you just listen to different people talking?</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, you look it up and then you'll see, like, a map of different facilities all over California. And you can click on the dots, and then it'll show you, like, where to listen to the stories.</br></br>

Caller: Is there a lot of people from this facility calling?</br></br>

UCI: We've had quite, like, a few.</br></br>

Caller: Oh, I was just curious.</br></br>

UCI: Mmhmm.</br></br>

Caller: All right. Thank you.</br></br>

UCI: Okay. Yeah, take care. Have a great night.</br></br>

Caller: All right. Bye.</br></br>

UCI: Okay. Bye.
