This story was told by a person incarcerated at Los Angeles County Men’s Central Jail.</br></br>

UCI: Okay and what has the COVID situation been like for you?</br></br>

Caller: The situation is that I've been here since the COVID pandemic started. And the way that the county jail has dealt with this module – because I've been in high power – this isolated module – is - is really next to nothing. They really haven't done anything. Hello?</br></br>

UCI: Okay. I understand. And how has your visitation and programming been affected?</br></br>

Caller: We haven't had any visitation, program. They just started giving us sporadic programming with limited - limited dayroom time. Other than that, we're in one-man cells.</br></br>

We are literally locked up, 24/7. If we don't go to court or if we don't get a visit from the lawyers or investigators, then we, we never come out our cell.</br></br>

UCI: Okay. And how long has that been happening for?</br></br>

Caller: This been happening ever since they locked us down for the COVID pandemic period. But I haven't had a – my - my family has been trying to visit for me for almost eight – a little over a year – almost a year-and-a-half now. And, literally, it's - they blaming it on COVID.</br></br>

They haven't – they let - they let one or two people out, out of 200.</br></br>

UCI: Okay. And how have you been coping with the pandemic?</br></br>

Caller: Coping is – coping is - I guess that's the better word. That's all I've been doing is coping with it. I've been trying to literally get cleaning supplies.</br></br>

There's been a problem getting – I wanted to know if I had already received COVID. And there's no way to find out if I've ever been infected by COVID. They've given me the Johnson vaccine.</br></br>

But it's – I, you know, they won't give me any proof or anything else. It's hard for me to get proof that I've even received the shot. So it's just, it's been one - it's been one nightmare after another.</br></br> 

My lawyers has tried and haven't been able to get any - or do something until nobody else is looking. Then, they go back to the status quo.</br></br>

UCI: I'm so sorry. I have to ask you to repeat what you just said. It cut out for a minute.</br></br>

Caller: Oh. That they literally – I've had my lawyers try to look into it. But, what the county jail here does, a lot of times, is they're act like they're going to fix something or they're making some type of overture that is - make it seem like they're on top of it. And then, as soon as no one else is looking, they go back to going – being the same as it was before the problem is - is been here.</br></br>

I mean, at the onset of this, we literally set up and like – and it'd sound like a coughing concert in here. It was people coughing, choking, throwing up. You can hear them moaning and gr- just literally seem like it was a hospital.</br></br>

But - but, like I say, they - the deputies come through here, half of them had they mask on halfway still. And the food they pass out has been managed by inmates who's constantly on quarantine because of COVID. The - the sanitation and dealing with our food and showers and everything else is so - so foul.</br></br>

Some people, they just don't even take part in it. If it hadn't been for family and loved ones, I probably would've starved to death in here, simply because of the food management and, you know, it just break – like they push the food through shower water. And milk crates that's on paper plates that's not covered properly.</br></br>

And you get your plate and there's dust and trash and, you know, bugs and stuff are on it. I mean it's - it's horrible. You got the trustees that's - that's passing out the food.</br></br>

They don't have a mask, hairnet. Sometimes, they don't even have on gloves. Sometimes, they'll drop the food on the floor, pick it up, and put it right – and this is in front of you.</br></br>

So it's – it's - not to mention what it goes through be- you know,you know during the time that it takes to get to us. And that's just some of the problems. The shower is always backing up, where we're standing in – if you go take a shower, it's a stall of, I believe, eight to ten stalls connected.</br></br>

And the shower drainage gets stopped up all the time. And it's just – and I'm talking about for at least years that the shower drain – the water comes up to at least your ankles. We literally have to turn the water off and let the water seep down while we standing in there.</br></br>

And the steam and everybody coughing and choking and sneezing and everything, like they're – so it's – it's - to me, it's a hazard. Especially, in these times of COVID.</br></br>

UCI: Right. And has this been happening before COVID and just gotten worse during COVID or did this kind of happen at the onset of COVID – that you're seeing these poor sanitation practices?</br></br>

Caller: Well, it's – it's some of them been happening prior to COVID and but they haven't been changed in light of COVID. And some - some of it took part during COVID. I don't know if it was a result of the pandemic.</br></br>

But - but, the problem is, is that these are - these are situations that could easily be remedied if someone actually just, you know, oversee them and tell them, "Hey, you'd - you'd do a lot better if you just do right." But we have deputies just sit here and watch TV all day. And they don't do nothing. We literally just sit here and suffer.</br></br>

UCI: Okay. I understand. And how has the vaccination process been at your facility?</br></br>

Caller: Well, they - they have a vaccination – like I said, I received the Johnson vaccination. And they come through and they – you know, they have someone else – a nurse – come through and ask if anybody wants to take a vaccine. So that's - that's here and there.</br></br> 

It's - it's not necessarily getting vaccinated that's the problem. The problem is what it takes to get there. And the people who doesn't get vaccinated are the people – we still here with people who's spreading COVID, who's – who's can easily spread COVID.</br></br>

UCI: Okay. And when were you offered the vaccine?</br></br>

Caller: It's been about three months ago. Three to four months ago.</br></br>

UCI: And are they coming back frequently to offer anyone the vaccine that didn't get it the previous time?</br></br>

Caller: It's just a routine. I got to say that they've been asking probably once a month.</br></br>

UCI: Okay. And are they giving you guys any information about the vaccine or about how COVID is and like what COVID is, in general?</br></br>

Caller: At the onsite - at the onset, they did, when they first started passing out the vaccine. But what has happened is that there are – where I'm at, people come and go. And, you know, since then, there's at least 95 percent of the people here is new.</br></br>

So they - these people that's new here, they've never received anything regarding COVID, as far as information's concerned. It's not something that's consistently done.</br></br>

UCI: Okay. And what has the - what else would have made the situation better at your facility?</br></br>

Caller: Just - just sanitation and – I mean the walls, outside – for instance, the walls outside our cells – there's 26 cells on a tier. There are four tiers on each module. And the walls outside our cells – they literally haven't been washed since I've been here. There's - there's every morning, we can get up and run your finger across the bars.</br></br> 

And you can literally see the trail of dust because that - that settled overnight. Simply because the blowers up there, they have dust packed on it, like - like a sandbox. You can literally see the dust falling in there.</br></br>

The ventilation system here has been cut off for the last two weeks – well, I'm gonna say a week – a little over a week, now – where it's just blowing – like, behind us, is what they call a "pipe chase," where the plumbers be at. And they have rats, roaches, and spiders, and lots of different type of insects back there. And it's usually whether – it sucks the air from out the cells into the back.</br></br>

But, somehow, it's been reversed. And, now, it's blowing all the dust and fungus and mold and everything that's back there – it's blowing it into our cells. And we literally had to block off the vent.</br></br>

So, now, we don't have any actual air that helps to circulate into these cells.</br></br>

UCI: Okay. I understand. And that has been getting worse through the pandemic? In that like the way that they've been cleaning the facility has already been like that before the pandemic and just gotten worse is what I'm assuming?</br></br>

Caller: Well, it's - it's basically the same. I can say that they didn't make any changes for the better, in light of the COVID pandemic. There's - there's literally – I mean they – they - like I said, they make a gesture.</br></br>

For instance, we had to fight to get them to pass out a mask for people that wasn't able to get masks through other means. And, since the - since the entire pandemic, where I'm at right now, they've only passed out a mask twice – twice.</br></br>

UCI: And-</br></br>

Caller: Other than that, we literally have to buy our masks through black market type settings. I mean there's – it's just kind of - it's kind of sad. You know.</br></br>

UCI: And so are you using the same mask that you've had since the second time they passed them out or have you had to resort to getting them elsewhere?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah. I had to resort to getting them elsewhere. Because, even though they did pass out the masks, they - they didn't fit. Like, for instance, you can only put one loop on one ear. But, then, you had to tie a string onto the other part just to make it fit around the other part of the ear.</br></br>

And that's everybody. Or, it was - or if your face was small enough, it'd fit so snug on your face it'd feel like you're being gagged.</br></br>

UCI: So it seems like they're providing you guys masks that are ineffective and too small?</br></br>

Caller: Yes. Extremely ineffective.</br></br>

UCI: Okay. I'm sorry to hear that.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah. My lawyer - my lawyer literally had to - had to purchase me a mask and asked the court to give it to me. Because I was coming into the court with mask half of my – that's only covering half my face.</br></br>

UCI: Okay. And have you noticed the pandemic delaying any processes that you've had in place with your lawyer?</br></br>

Caller: Excuse me. Say that one more time.</br></br>

UCI: Have you noticed the pandemic, you know, delaying any processes that you have in order with your lawyer?</br></br>

Caller: Yes. My lawyer or my investigator. Especially my investigator, hasn't been able to come down. Simply because she has underlying conditions regarding COVID.</br></br>

And she's very much aware of how ineffective they are with sanitation and providing a safe environment for us to conduct our legal affairs adequately.</br></br>

UCI: And are you-</br></br>

Caller: My lawyer's the same.</br></br>

UCI: Okay. And are you able to at least video or phone call with them?</br></br>

Caller: No. Well, we have a conference call thing set up. But it - it sets up a situation where we can't actually talk as we would if we was able to talk in person.</br></br>

UCI: Right. Because the calls are being monitored.</br></br>

Caller: Yes.</br></br>

UCI: Okay. Well, is there anything else you want people to know about your experience?</br></br>

Caller: We, here, - we here - and where I'm at, it's called, "high power." And I've been in high power ten years. It's isolated.</br></br>

It's isolation. It's one-man cells. And these one-man cells – my parents' bathroom is bigger than them. But they're open in the front.</br></br>

And, if one person catches COVID in here, nine times out of ten, it's gonna spread like wildfire. And that has happened – where it literally – you could tell how it spread, from back to front, through the tier. We – I would like for anybody that has any ideas that would help us just to get proper treatment, proper care, and dealing with our food, our shower situation, our visitation.</br></br>

Because our families haven't seen us over years. Like I said, I've been here ten years. And I had family members pass away who literally wanted to come talk to me before they passed away and couldn't.</br></br>

So I'm - we're looking for anybody that can help us, that can help us out of having to live in fear of catching COVID and dealing with passing, spreading, and just going to the hospital.</br></br> 

I have asthma. I have asthma real bad. And for me to catch COVID is - is scary in itself. So I'm going – I literally have to hang up plastic in front of my cell and keep my cell covered up with blankets and plastic just because I don't want people talking and spitting and spraying.</br></br>

And because they have people that throw feces. They got people that throw urine. They have a lot of mental cases that come through here as well.</br></br>

So we have to literally take precautions on ourself. And dealing with our cases and dealing with actually living and surviving in here, we shouldn't have to do that. I'm a pre-trial detainee.</br></br>

And I shouldn't have to live as if I have to fight for my life and on a day to day basis, as well as fight for my life in court. I should have - I should be able to work with my lawyers and concentrate on my case and concentrating on dealing with my - and concentrating on dealing with my legal affairs. I cannot do that here.</br></br>

This is - this is extremely – you can see the stress level and everything else that it's causing on people here. So I just want to let people know, if they can help us in any way, I would - it would really much be appreciated.</br></br>

UCI: Well, I just want to thank you very much for participating in PrisonPandemic. And, if you would please consider telling your friends or family about us and seeing if they'd like to call in. That would be appreciated. And thank you very much for your testimony today.</br></br>

Caller: Thank you. Thank you.</br></br>

UCI: Alright. Bye-bye.</br></br>

Caller: Bye-bye.
