This story was told by a person incarcerated at CIW (California Institution for Women).</br></br>

UCI: Have you had access to any medicine at all?</br></br> 

Caller: Yeah, they just brought the Moderna. I just got vaccinated the first part of it. I believe it was Saturday. Yeah, so you know, I'm saying Moderna whatever and I was, I'm in the medium risk so they said the high risk people were first, medium risk, and low risk and no risk and that they would go down like that.</br></br>  

But it still comes back to what about the preventive measures? And now when they have all these jobs that are available and then where they can create cleaning crews per building that are not porters that come out and they clean the walls, they clean the seat every time somebody uses a telephone. They haven't even thought that far. And this is reality for us in here, so we're now we're not even given that.</br></br>  

Yeah, we're not even given the new masks anymore. They want us to go back to the cloth masks, which I'm deathly afraid of. If I had 12 out of the 13 symptoms, the only thing I didn't contract was the vomiting and the diarrhea and that's because I didn't have nothing on my stomach, all I could do was drink liquid.</br></br> 

UCI: Well, so but for the people that when the people did have like whoever contracted COVID, were, did you have access to medicine for that?</br></br> 

Caller: No, they offered us Tylenol.</br></br> 

UCI: Okay.</br></br> 

Caller: And I can't take Tylenol 'cause it’s the blood thinner and I was like I was gonna be fitted for a pacemaker. So all of my medical issues were out there, and then when, when the vitals would come by and they want to say oh well, we're giving vitals every day. Yeah, we're giving vital. Most of the nurses were mean, ugly, and rude.</br></br>  

Meaning that their attitudes and their demeanors were mean, ugly, and rude. And this is what they were doing, so they never asked caringly. Hey, are you okay? Are you okay? How do you feel today?</br></br> 

They were like what is your number? What's your this? Well just go back in the room then, I'm just gonna extend you. You know it was. Everything was about punishment we’re already being punished we’re damn near dying in prison.</br></br> 

UCI: Exactly.</br></br> 

Caller: How much more punishment can we get? You know?</br></br> 

UCI: And plus visitation too.</br></br> 

Caller: For myself. For visitation, they just, they stopped that maybe about I want to say about six months back, but now they want you to wear a mask to go to visiting, to sit there with your family while you're wearing a mask. So you can sit in a booth and talk on a video chat. Yeah.</br></br> 

UCI: That's crazy.</br></br> 

Caller: That’s through. The Education Department in here is like twice, each building goes once. Once the number comes up like if you live in 15, then you go on the whatever date. Then when you live in another building then you'll go on another day from there as well. But this month it's twice.</br></br> 

It is twice a- twice this month to go to school instead of running it for the whole of whatever and it’s D yard, it’s C yard, it’s B yard. They're doing it one day at a time, and all this crazy stuff, but everything it still comes back to the inmate is suffering.</br></br>
 
The bottom line here is we don't get fresh air on a regular basis, our schedules and allotted times are from 9:30 in the morning until 10:30, we never get out for that. From 11 until 12 you might get out for that. They won't do that because at 12:00 o'clock it’s noon. So you're supposed to get meds at that time, so why should we let you out when we just have to run meds.</br></br>  

So it's a lot of, you know, everything looks good on paper here, but it's not being applied.
