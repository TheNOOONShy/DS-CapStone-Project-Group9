UCI: What’s the current COVID situation at your facility?</br></br>

Caller: We had a quarantine. Right now we are on a modified program.</br></br>

UCI: How has your facility handled COVID-19 since the beginning of the outbreak and then till now? Has it changed at all?</br></br>

Caller: I think that in the beginning of the outbreak as well as with the rest of the nation, CDC got caught off guard. There was a lot of procedures that were just dumped on us. But they didn’t stop school in the beginning. Then they stopped the schools.</br></br>

Then they started trying to enforce yards but maybe trying to tell the population to just keep social distance, which really didn’t happen not even a month after. Then they finally say wear the mask and start doing announcements every morning. Like at 6 o'clock until it became like you have to wear the mask, mandatory. But it wasn’t really like it was enforced as much amongst the staff. It was more like the inmates have to wear it.</br></br> 

You see the staff a bunch it was like debates between well we can never give COVID to one another, is only the staff that bring it in so once- once they stay away from us we will be safe. Then as it progress there was a few outbreaks that prompt the change of regulations.</br></br>

Like, first it was like three buildings able to go to yard together but then it was just two buildings, one in the lower yard, one in the upper yard. Then it was to quarantine people in place so that if let’s say if, in foxyard there was there is 10 buildings so there will be building 10, building three that can go out, that couldn’t go to phones. They went to eat their meals after everybody was done because they have potential COVID within them.</br></br> 

They pretty much were secluded from everybody else. And so they progress minimally until they started sending people to next dorm to be quarantine and isolation in single cells. Not that it helped much because we get the COVID from staff.</br></br> 

So, the now what they're permanently doing, is that if somebody gets COVID, they quarantine that building, send everybody as they find them and then test them and check vitals everyday to see if there is any signs of COVID among the people that live together.</br></br>
 
Being dorm living is restricted to 65 people per dorm. And they have separate rearranged the living quarters to have pods, which is what they call it, which is every six bunks they are bunched up together and there is a space in between them that is six feet apart.</br></br>

But you have let's say bunk 12, 13, 14 in regular spacing, which is about three feet from one another. And then you have lower, which is you and your bunkee within three feet. And then there is space and then it will be 16, 17, 18 all together then another space, six feet. So it is not really like isolation as they seem.</br></br> 

UCI: How have you been coping with the crisis inside?</br></br>       
 
Caller: I think I have been taking the mantle of activism. It's one of the reasons why I’m telling this. We have done 602s, we have done a little bit of like awareness on they are, as opposed to couple of months back but nobody had a hope of seeing anything.</br></br> 

I think that ultimately I just kinda stick to my friends and just sit down on my bunk and try to be as clean as possible. Just stay away from the guards all together because I know that my peers can’t really give it to me unless they are talking to them, I just kind of stay away from those who want to be talking to people in the office all the time. But I’m into doing things that are both spiritually-minded and practical.</br></br> 

UCI: How had the COVID-19 situation at your facility affected your loved ones and your visitation with them?</br></br> 

Caller: Well, even the fact that I went to quarantine a couple of weeks back, it was a little frustrating for my family not knowing what happened to me cause I used to call them weekly. And then I went to quarantine and they didn’t know whether I had COVID or not. I only got a message through somebody else. Which I had to trust with my family’s phone number to let them know that I left for what I thought that was two weeks. It ended up being 23 days.</br></br>

So we went through it. There was a little stress. I’m not gonna say that it wasn’t, but we came out stronger. At least that’s what I believe in. And my visitation, well, we haven’t got a visit since like March. I haven’t seen my family since like forever. I’ve been down in for like 13 years now in October and not even the prospect of video visits.</br></br> 

Video computers in our visiting room, and they are always full, we only can get visiting once a month in the video calls. So that is pretty much it. I don’t see no hope of ever seeing my family until this is over because every time that we have the hope of the yard opening up, we get cleared at the levels according to the guidelines of CDCR, somebody commits a mistake, somebody doesn’t get tested, or comes back and tests positive.</br></br> 

What I hear is like they test them in the morning, and then two hours later they tell them, “Hey you got COVID, get out of there”.  But we are already exposed, so we go back again FCOM three, or whatever they wanna call it.</br></br> 

And we just get locked down, so there’s no program. There’s no program, there’s no visits.</br></br>
 
UCI: I understand. And do you have any ideas about what could potentially make the situation better at your facility?</br></br>

Caller: Situation better at my facility as far as COVID or as far as visits?</br></br>

UCI: Well, I guess COVID and how it's affected your, you can talk about how it has affected your visits. Whatever you think that would better, their handling of COVID, I guess.</br></br> 

Caller: I mean, I think they staff needs to be directed to obey these rules. Maybe some type of quick tests. I know the test is really expensive. It’s like $150 for the quick test. But, we shouldn’t be exposed to staff that is potentially sick inside the facility, if they are supposed to be in charge of protecting us. Then they shouldn’t be allowed in until they know for sure that they are negative.</br></br>
 
I hear that staff out there is not really following the regulations of social gathering. So that should be somewhat enforced and maybe looked into in some type of way, to say that if you are a public servant and you come into a facility, that you need to follow these guidelines so that no other person dies. Because life is precious.</br></br> 

But it also costs the department a lot every time that an incarcerated person dies. In the facility, there have been COVID-related deaths, even if it isn't like, based on like I checked out with COVID but because of the other symptoms COVID brings. It adds issues to whatever other health issues that person has, they died, because they contracted COVID and made their condition worse.</br></br> 

So, I think that they should enforce a little bit more the security, and the way that people, they work in the prison system, is doing their sanitary and other safety concerns and procedures.</br></br> 

UCI: Thank you. And is there anything else that you want to share with anyone about your experience?</br></br>

Caller: I think that when I went to CMC East, which is the wing for the isolation, C yard. They need to do a better job at maintaining the rest of the routine while you're on isolation, like when we were down there, we never had clothing and some change.</br></br>

The first wave was never allowed to keep their property. There was an unsanitary issue where they got all the trash with the PPE COVID and they destroy it together with the regular trash, and I guess the seagulls got in the trash. There was PPE garments all over the yard which they had to train.</br></br>

There’s a lot of things that they could solve, they’re not doing right now. Maybe call you later, tell you more about it.
