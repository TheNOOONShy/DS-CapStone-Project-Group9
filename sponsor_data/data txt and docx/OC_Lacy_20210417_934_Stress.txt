I have not being doing good my (ptsd) doesn’t let me rest. I’m scared of this COVID its no joke, no visits, no one to talk to, there’s no programs here due to COVID- no school. We are stuck in a cell 22 hours a day. The only time we come out if for a day room other than that we’re like dogs in a kennel. I got (ptsd) due to being in jail this time due to COVID, being stressed out, can’t sleep not knowing if I have COVID. Or is my celly who just got tested and came back (+) gonna give it to me. We fill out grievances, and no looks at them or does anything about it.</br></br>I feel that when we address the sergeant with a complaint the sheriffs just shred our paperwork cause without paperwork there’s no paper trail. Paper trail matters big time, I’m not the only inmate suffering in here; there’s a lot of us who are dealing with the same conflicts. I will be calling also so this will be on record. I don’t know if they read thus letter they might make it disappear and it might not reach you, but if it does I hope I painted a pretty pic for you.</br></br>
