This story was told by a person incarcerated at Santa Rita Jail.</br></br>

UCI: Wow, and are they overcrowding, like, your prison especially? With all these-</br></br>

Caller: Yeah. They’re trying to get people in here no matter what they got to do. I mean, if they’re doing that with databases, then guess what? I have a newspaper editor that has confirmed with expert consult and we’re getting ready to do an article on it, and that the CLETS database is in San Mateo County.</br></br> 

Stands for California Law Enforcement Telecommunications Systems database. It is accessed statewide by every county in the state of California. All 27 counties. And it’s been left erroneously errored and inaccurate for decades on purpose to do this.</br></br>

To, they've been saying that you're on probation even if you are on probation and you earlier discharged in the original three years or five-year-sentencing guidelines, they’ll still keep you in the database as on probation when you’re off. So, you’re not, you're never off. You’re always, on until that whole - wow, now all the free calls are gone, and now it’s saying I got one minute.</br></br> 

Wow. Yeah, so they’re listening to me giving you guys this information, and they don’t like it. I’m being honest with you.</br></br>

UCI: That’s pretty crazy, especially during a pandemic too, where it just sounds like they’re trying to shove in as many prisoners as they can into like a facility - just one facility - with a virus that’s really contagious that can spread around pretty quickly. That’s pretty dangerous.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, they’re doing it on purpose. All they care about is their money. All they want is, "Okay since we have to empty a lot of them out of there, out of the prisons and out of the jails, we need to find a way to keep as many of them up in here as much as we can." So, yeah. I’m going to call back one more time.</br></br>

UCI: Okay. All right.</br></br>

Caller: All right. Bye.
