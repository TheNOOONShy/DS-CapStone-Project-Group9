UCI: What's the situation there right now with COVID-19?</br></br>Caller: Well, they got this building on quarantine right now. And, you know, they call themselves taking precautionary measures, you know, all of a sudden. You know, and they try to make themselves look good. However, when all this stuff happened way back in March, you know, they had moved a bunch of people from different yards to this building in particular.</br></br>And this yard in particular. And funnel them in, you know, little by little. And the guys that came over here already told us that they were already exposed to the COVID-19. Now shortly after, you know, they did this they started moving all these guys out. You know, and I had tested positive on May 9th, 2020. Yeah. And filed a grievance about it.</br></br>And they had responded in a way to where they tried to make it sound like it was my fault that I caught the COVID virus. And I had the chance to, you know, report any symptoms like on May 9th, 2020 when my test was never even happening. Because they said, they actually said that I was tested like on May 9th, 2020.</br></br>You know, no, it was May 5th, excuse me. It was May 5th, 2020. Somewhere early in May. But the test never happened. And I had pointed that out in the response on the grievance. And now all of a sudden headquarters is not answering anything.</br></br>UCI: Is this sort of the case with other people that you're around? Has anyone else experienced this?</br></br>
Caller: No. No, I'm actually filing something on my own to, you know, they don't allow us to file group appeals anymore. So, basically what they did was when I sent it out, sent the grievance out at the headquarters level, the response, they flagging the mail and they not letting the mail get out. But at the same time, you know, I still have the tracking number to the grievance when I initially filed it on June 19th.</br></br>But at the same time though, I believe that they're actually flagging my mail and certain mail that they're flagging that's confidential, they're withholding it so it won't get to the destination. So, they can, you know, conceal guilt and liability.</br></br>Yeah. But this is the culture of CDC. This is what they've been doing. I got 26 years in. You know. From the time that I was a kid when I first came in here in 1998.</br></br>I've seen them, I've seen the good, the bad, and the ugly. But I've seen more ugly than anything with them. And, you know, they're one of the organizations that commit more crimes than anybody else in the system. You know, they do more wrong than we do and then they try to lie to the public and say that it's us that's bad. But if you do a consensus and see how many times they've been, you know, convicted, and fired, and walked off for misconduct and illegal activities, you'd be shocked.
