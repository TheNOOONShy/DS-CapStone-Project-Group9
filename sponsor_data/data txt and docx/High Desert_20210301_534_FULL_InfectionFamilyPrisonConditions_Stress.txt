This letter was written by a person incarcerated at High Desert.</br></br>

Hope that by the time you receive this letter it finds you in good health, spirits, and enthusiasm to keep doing what you're doing on helping out people like me. To be honest your letter caught me by surprise but it really made my day no lie. This COVID-19 tragedy has taken a lot for me.</br></br>

Not did I only lost the love of my life, which it was my fiance, but I also lost the opportunity on getting to form a family with someone that I really love.</br></br>

A lot of people wouldn't be able to understand the pain I feel until they get sentenced to life without parole. And a prison in the middle of nowhere almost 12 hours away from your family in a place where you can't even trust your shadow. My only hope was to get married to my lady, get family visits, and try my best to run a good program to hopefully go home one day.</br></br> 

But this COVID-19 killed most of my illusions.</br></br>

My ex couldn't come see me. I only was able to get a 15-minute call twice a month. And little by little she became tired of it until the arguments and sure enough our breakup came right after.</br></br>

I ended up catching COVID-19, which had me wanting to give up on life. I can't go to school at this moment because of the pandemic. I lost my job because they close down my building to use it as a quarantine building. Plus a lot of way more personal problems I got going on which to be honest I don't even know how to deal with.</br></br> 

I'm barely 27 years old. And sometimes I feel that I had been through way more problems than a regular person could have in a whole entire life.</br></br>

To be honest with you the only thing that has me going is my familyâ€™s support. They have always been there for me no matter what, and they are the reason why I keep going. They assured me that I will be home soon and that I'll soon find a lady who could mentally support a person like me through these hard times.</br></br> 

Other than that, I honestly think that there could be way more things, programs, etc. that this prison could do for us instead of just having us in lockdown 24/7.</br></br> 

Plus everyone in my yard was real mad. Because in the beginning of everything, the warden brought inmates who were already sick with COVID-19 from other yards into ours. That got us infected with the virus, putting all of us at risk.</br></br> 

So yeah, that's a little bit of what's going on in my life, how about yourself? How old are you? What are your goals in life? What do you think about young people like us in prison? I mean, I opened up to you right? It's only fair for me to know about yourself as well, don't you think so?</br></br>

Hope to hear from you soon, I'll keep you in my prayers and I really apologize about my messy ass writing. I'm currently working on writing my second book. So my little hand, it's already hurting from writing the whole day you know.</br></br> 

I'll promise to keep you updated with it, well that's if you right back. Interested in a new friend.</br></br>

With much respect.
