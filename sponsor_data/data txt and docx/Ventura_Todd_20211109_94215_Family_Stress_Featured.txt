This story was told by a person incarcerated at Todd Road Jail.</br></br>

Caller: It's been - it's been rough. You know what I mean? And I think about my - my family because I have five sisters, and my mom — my mom just got - one of her breasts removed, and she's getting the other one removed because of cancer, and she has a weak heart.</br></br>

So I worry that she might get it, and then being incarcerated and not being able to be there for her, it's a little stressful. I have another sister. She's the youngest out of five. She has three tumors in her head.</br></br>

One of them just got removed from her brain, and she had to learn how to walk, use the bathroom, how to eat, how to talk, everything like a - like a born baby again. You know her son, which is my nephew, has a tumor in his face. It's like a little deformed.</br></br>

My other sister has cancer. My brother, he's 30 - 39, he fell off - he fell off the hotel a couple months ago, five stories, you know what I mean? He can barely walk.</br></br>

You know what I like - I've been going through it, you know what I mean? But I still try to stay positive, you know and I worry for them because they - they're - I know COVID-19 attacks the immune system. Like - like old - elderly people like my mom or - or even the - the young ones, you know?</br></br> 

So, I - I worry about them, you know? It's - it's just hard, you know what I mean, being in here and finding out something that's — something might happen to them, you know?
