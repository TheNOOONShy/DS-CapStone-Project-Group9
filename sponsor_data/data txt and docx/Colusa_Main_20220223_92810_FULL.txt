This story was told by a person incarcerated at Colusa County Jail.</br></br>

UCI: What facility are you currently housed at?</br></br>

Caller: Colusa County Jail.</br></br>

UCI: Thank you. And then what has the COVID situation been like at your facility?</br></br>

Caller: The COVID situation has not been taken really serious. They most definitely don’t provide us masks upon movement. They do upon court dates, but like regularly they don’t switch them out. They just let us keep – they expect us to keep the same one.</br></br>

As for family and stuff, coming to visit and visitation and things like that, everything’s pretty normal. They just  – they have behind-the-glass visits and stuff like that. They have us on the 23-hour lockdown.</br></br>

For some inmates they consider it classifying us as high max. They put us in lockdown for 23 hours a day or 21 hours a day, so they give us two hours of break. And as far as like, what else? Like, as far as all COVID related?</br></br>

UCI: Yeah. Anything that you feel you need to talk about COVID-wise.</br></br>

Caller: Well the main thing – that’s the main thing, the mask situation. And when I was housed in general population, they have tanks filled up to the max capacity. There’s no room for social distancing.</br></br> 

We don’t have, like, cleaning supplies or, like, antibacterial, disinfectant given to us daily. They packed it once a day, but I feel like they should have like a spray bottle or something.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>

Caller: I was just – I was just recently in prison in Solano. And they used to provide us with, like, spray bottles for our sections. Spray bottles with bleach, constantly wash our hands, and hand towels, so we could continue to wipe down frequently used areas. As far as masks, they’d give us the surgical masks.</br></br>

Like I said, they only provided one surgical mask instead of, like, providing us numerous ones, and putting a box of masks in our dorm facility. They’d give us one every time we go to court, they expect us to reuse that one. I actually got a habeas corpus going on that I just recently filed. I’m waiting from the Supreme Court to get back on me about that.</br></br>
 
Because I feel like there’s more that they could be doing instead of just the limit that they give us. What else, what else? Yeah, as far as like cleaning supplies I feel like they could be doing more than once a day. I feel like they could be letting us our cells a little bit more.</br></br>

Like I said, the capacity to the housing units are 10 – 10 people per dorm. They – when I was out there in general population they already had filled us up to the max. And due to the fact that there was like a little cough or flu going around, I – I wrote a grievance.</br></br>

And then due to that fact that I wrote a grievance they separated me and they moved me to ad seg, which I’m under 22 hours lockdown. It’s pretty shitty back here, no lie. And the same thing they only let us out twice, two hours a day, from whatever your cell door – your cell [unintelligible] come out to your rec, day room, which we’re able to shower, use the phone.</br></br>

The phone is just a speaker box on the phone. They don’t give us no supplies to, like, clean here or, like, disinfect it. Like, we have to use just like whatever we have, soap and water.</br></br>

The showers are not clean – clean like they are supposed to be, like, they just leave it up to us to deal with it. And a lot of inmates don’t go unpunished [unintelligible] to cleaning or something.</br></br>

Other than that, everything is pretty regular. But there most definitely can be some adjustments. They need somebody from the outside can contact them and let them know about the adjustments though, because if we bring it up to them they just shut us up or just ignore our request and just continue about their day like nothing.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah.</br></br>

UCI: Do the staff follow the proper protocol?</br></br>

Caller: I mean as far as the staff, yeah they all come in here with their little masks on. I also – I also had inquired about them providing us with N95 masks, you know the proper masks?</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>

Caller: To stop the virus from being spread? The surgical masks, I don’t feel like they’re helpful, you know? They bust real easy and they expect us to tie it back up or stuff like that.</br></br> 

That’s on my – that’s on my habeas corpus that they need to supply us with N95 masks. And I wish y’all could weigh in on that, I don’t know what’s gonna happen with that.</br></br>

But as far as the staff and stuff, for the most part, ever since I filed my habeas corpus I’ve been seeing a lot of them wearing their N95 masks or the surgical masks around the facility. But they don’t make it like a set thing like whenever you go to a movement or stuff or like when we walk from here to yard like they don’t enforce that rule on us like they’re supposed to do.</br></br>

UCI: Have they offered the vaccination to any of you?</br></br>

Caller: Since I’ve been here? No. They have not offered it to me. I’ve been here since November 2021 and they haven’t offered it to me.</br></br> 

When I was in prison I got my first vaccination and then I was released, like, before I got my second one. So, I was released in May. I took my first shot while I was in [redacted], and then when I was released – I wasn’t able to get the second one until I came back to custody in Colusa County.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>

Caller: [Unintelligible] or anything like that.</br></br>

UCI: You had mentioned you’re able to have court visitations. Have you had any problems related to COVID in that sense?</br></br>

Caller: Where? At court?</br></br>

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: No. No. They, at court, they take it very serious.</br></br>

They, as soon as you get to court, they provide you a mask. So, they take it more serious. Like, when you walk into the courtroom and the judge is in there the judge will make you wear a mask.</br></br>

But other than that, like the staff, at first - at first they weren’t – they were just like whatever. But, I feel like ever since I filed my habeas corpus like they’ve been trying to enforce the rules more like a little bit more serious. But like I tell them like they shouldn’t have to wait for somebody to say something about it, like they should be on it theirselves, you know I prefer.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>

Caller: Supplying us with like – the main thing is like they don’t supply us with no cleaning supplies throughout the day. Like, antibacterial. I know they have it, like antibacterial, like any type of [unintelligible] they have. A spray bottle that we could keep at least in the housing unit so we could spray off the phone, the sink, the toilet and the tables where we sit at. They don’t provide none of that.</br></br>

UCI: If you asked for it do you think they’d help you with it?</br></br>
 
Caller: Possibility, but they act like their job is so hard already. Like when you request for stuff like that, they just like tell you, “Yeah, on my next round,” or “Hold on, I’ll do it,” but they never do it. They won’t follow through with it.</br></br> 

So, like, it’ll already be time for us to lock it down and they’ll be like, “Oh, it’s already late. You only got like 10 minutes left,” or stuff like that.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>

Caller: Like right now, I requested. As soon as they let me out, I came out to my day room hours at 8:00 and I requested that the cleaning supplies I was like, “Can you give me a cleaning supplies, disinfectant?” She said she was gonna bring it but she never came through. Not like she’s gonna come bring it back on her next round.</br></br>

UCI: Well, this has been a lot of great information. Is there anything else you’d like to share about the COVID situation tonight?</br></br>

Caller: That’s about it. That’s about it. That’s about everything.</br></br>

UCI: Well, thank you so much for calling. If you can, you can tell friends or family about it, and they could call in, but no pressure at all.</br></br>

Caller: Okay. I wrote you guys a letter too yesterday. How long would that take for you guys to respond?</br></br>

UCI: It honestly depends on the mailing system, but we have a team who’s processing them daily. So as soon as they get it, they’ll be able to process it, pull out all the information.</br></br>

Caller: So you’re a college student Irvine, at UCI or whatever?</br></br>

UCI: Yeah. I’m a college student.</br></br>

Caller: Oh, okay. Okay. Yeah, oh so you’re [redacted]</br></br>

UCI: Hm?</br></br>

Caller: I said so you’re [redacted]?</br></br>

UCI: Can you repeat that?</br></br>

Caller: I said so your name is [redacted]?</br></br>

UCI: Oh, no, it’s [redacted].</br></br>

Caller: Oh. Oh, that’s a beautiful name. From Friends, right?</br></br>

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: That’s nice.</br></br>

UCI: Well, thank you again so much for calling.</br></br>

Caller: It was a pleasure talking to you and letting you hear – letting you hear me out. It was very, like, relieving. Thank you so much for your time and for you guys doing this. Like, I really appreciate it and stuff.</br></br>

UCI: No, thank you. It’s not possible without your guys’ stories.</br></br>

Caller: Okay, well you have a wonderful night, sleep tight, and take care.</br></br>

UCI: You too.</br></br>

Caller: All right, bye-bye.
