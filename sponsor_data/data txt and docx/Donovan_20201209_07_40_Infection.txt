This story was told by a person incarcerated at Donovan.</br></br>

UCI: All right. And what is your current COVID-19 situation at your facility?</br></br>

Caller: Well, that's a question I really don't know. We [unintelligible] last January. I got really, really sick, and I thought I was about to die. I went man down, and they took me to the clinic, and then they brought me back and said, "Oh, you'll be all right." Well, the next day I was so bad I thought I was going to die. And I went back, and they took me straight to a hospital I was so bad.</br></br>

They put me on an IV and pumped me full of fluids and all that, and then they took me and locked me down for two weeks at another facility here at R.J. Donovan and kept me locked down for two weeks. Well, when the two weeks' quarantine was up, they had told me that I had just type A flu. But I'm telling you it wasn't the flu.</br></br>

It doesn't take three months after being sick to recover. I could hardly walk for the next month and a half at least, you know. And it wasn't just me. Everybody in this facility was sick. But nobody knew what it was back in January, and nobody would tell us what it was. But that's what we believe.</br></br>

UCI: Okay. So, what do you think is troubling or concerning you at this point?</br></br>

Caller: Well, the concern, I didn't- the concern is when they still bring people to our yard that's closed to intake, and they bring other people from other yards or other prisons. We have an EOP mental health facility here. It's one building, and it houses all the mental health people, right?</br></br> 

Well, we go to the yard with them, and they bring all kinds of people to put in that building, and then they go to the yard with us. They eat in the same chow hall with us. You know, we go to medical together, you know. All the buildings do.</br></br>

So, our concern is them bringing other people here, and they're going to give it to us. Now, I've never had anything affect me the way this did.</br></br>

I couldn't breathe. I couldn't move. Every muscle in my body hurt for months, and it took a long time to recover. So, I can't believe that it was the flu, but they won't tell us that's what it was. So, we don't know.</br></br>

UCI: Oh, wow. And how was COVID-19 handled by your facility at the beginning of the outbreak?</br></br>

Caller: Well, none of the staff wanted to wear a mask. Nobody really believed in it, that it was that bad and whatever. Now, they're doing a pretty good job. All the staff are wearing a mask. In fact, it kind of went to overkill because they've got us locked down.</br></br> 

We don't go to the yard. We don't go to the chow hall. We don't have any education. We don't have any self-help groups. We don't have nothing. So, we're just completely locked down. I don't care because I don't want to get it and die. You know?</br></br>

UCI: And what would make the situation at your facility better?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, that's a good question. I don't have the answer. I don't know that there is anything that we could do other than being more transparent. You know?</br></br>

One of the worst things that's happening is because â€“ if you have a medical issue and they have to take you out to a hospital or to a clinic or somewhere, they take you and lock you down in another facility for two weeks, and you lose your housing bed where you're at. Then they bring you back and put you in another housing unit with other people that you don't like and you don't get along with, and you wind up having trouble.</br></br>

So, a lot of people, they're not seeking the medical treatment that they need. My neighbor here has had heart problems, and he was told that they needed to take his pacemaker and do some things and take him out to the hospital to do it.</br></br>

And because he was going to lose the bed he was at and he had been having so many problems with housing with other people for so long, he told them, "No, I'm going to refuse the treatment." Well, two days later he died in his sleep in the middle of the night because he didn't want to go get quarantined for two weeks and lose his bed.</br></br>

So, this is happening to a lot of people. They're having more serious problems because they won't seek and get the medical help that they need.
