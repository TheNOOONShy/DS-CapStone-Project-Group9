Wow. Receiving this letter from you is like you heard my cries. A couple of days before receiving your letter I was filled with so much indignation and I wanted to tell someone so bad what we go through in here. It’s very rare that the things we complain about in here makes it past the gates. A majority of grievances get denied and die as quick as they started.</br></br>


I’ve been in prison 17 years, things have changed a lot over the years but there’s still things that haven’t changed a bit. And those things that haven’t changed is what made this pandemic Hell on Earth. I’ve never feared for my life in prison the way I have during this pandemic. And I’ve been on yards where there are stabbings and killings daily.</br></br>


At the beginning of this I said if COVID makes it to this prison I’m going to get it and that came to be true. And watching it all unfold in real time right in front of me until the virus made it to me was the worst. The mistakes that prison were making before my eyes were unsettling. Us inmates were making mistakes also but leadership was setting all the examples.</br></br>


And what makes things bad is you see the director on T.V. and hear him giving you all these promises that took months to see and some we are still waiting on. The two biggest lies “we are doing all in our power to keep you safe and communicate with you,” and we are finding ways to give you more connection with family and loved ones.</br></br>


I’ve never felt more alone in prison than now.
