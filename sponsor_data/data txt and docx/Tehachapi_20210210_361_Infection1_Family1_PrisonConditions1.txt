What has it been like to be inside during this time?</br></br>

When I seen on the news about a virus that is spreading around the world that attacks the respiratory system I was like “what the fuck is going on.” That’s something out of a movie or in a book. I thought about my family and if they will be safe, then I thought it wouldn’t make it close home. Then it was everywhere and people started to die.</br></br> 

I’m thankful that none of my family members that I’m in contact with contracted the virus so far in this pandemic.</br></br>

Mandatory mask and six feet distance and all that and it still spreads like the wildfires. Being incarcerated while all this is going on has left me feeling useless to my family. Knowing that my grandma could die from this virus if she caught it while going to the store for food. And I can’t be there to do all that for her or any of my other elderly family is a messed up feeling.</br></br>

Since we know that our elders and certain other people fall under that high risk of death and hospitalization of the virus it should be the low-risk individuals that take care of them. And not being able to do that because I got myself in prison would mess me up if one of my family died. All I can do from my situation is hope and pray for everyone to make it out safely.</br></br>

How do you feel about your safety inside?</br></br>

I thought it wouldn’t make it into the prison. Then the news said correctional staff tested positive in another prison close by. Then rumors go around about staff looking sick and coughing. Some staff haven’t came back to work in a couple days.</br></br>

The one morning you hear over the loud speaker “COVID testing” and I’m getting a swab shoved deep into my nostril. Couple days later, you got nurses decked in PPE in the building saying we’re on quarantine because people tested positive. After two weeks of quarantine, we get yard so people go ask those individuals that had tested positive how was it.</br></br>

As time went on, more positive cases and more quarantine. They passed out to inmates these cloth masks and told us to wear them at all times when we come out our cells. But it wasn’t enforced and some staff wouldn’t wear masks so slowly no one wore masks. Then new COVID-19 cases and now they want to turn a building into the quarantine building.
