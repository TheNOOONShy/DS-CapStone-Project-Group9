Having a daily routine and a good program are conducive to dealing with life in prison in a positive manner. Programs such as school (G.E.D., high school, college courses), self-help groups, and vocational training, give one in prison a sense of purpose and accomplishment. But, due to COVID-19, the education department has been closed down and self-help groups have stopped running.</br></br> 

When we were on normal program, those of us taking college courses could go to school every day, those who are enrolled in either the high school or G.E.D. program would go about once or twice a week, and the computer vocation students were required to attend every day, Monday through Friday. As for the self-help groups, they used to run a different one almost every week night, Groups such as, A.A., N.A., GOGI, and Criminal Gangs Anonymous (CGA), etc. By completing a certain amount of hours in these self-help groups, we are able to earn certificates. In some cases earning these certificates are court ordered, or required by the parole board in order for us to earn our release.</br></br> 

We can also earn “milestone credits,” or good time conduct credits, upon completion of certain educational programs. Which allows us to get some time taken off of sentence. I am very grateful that the college program here is through correspondence courses and can be done from our cells. This has helped since we are in a pandemic and cannot attend class.</br></br>

I was able to complete my last courses and earn my A.A. degree in Liberal Arts, with an emphasis on Sociology from Feather River Community College because of this. I really enjoy reading and studying, they are some of my coping strategies. A means of mental escape that makes me feel alive, like I’m progressing and not staying stagnant, or frozen in time.</br></br>

Another one of my coping mechanism is exercising, it is a good means of stress relief and staying healthy. Which is very important especially in these uncertain times we are in. During this pandemic I have also started writing more, I have always enjoyed it, but I have been focusing more on it lately. It has allowed me to express myself and to look at things from a different perspective upon reading my work.</br></br>
