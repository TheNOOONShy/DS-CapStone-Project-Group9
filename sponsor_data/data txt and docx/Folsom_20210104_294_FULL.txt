Early to bed, early to rise, makes the man healthy, wealthy, and wise. Or am I in a rush to conclude the day, and start another just to see my hopes diminish.</br></br>
 
Helpless, my hands are tied, and I’m forced to watch my fellow man pass away. I owe a debt to society, I plead with the powers that be to put me on the front line of the fight. It’s either that or sit here and wait for one of the COs to come personally hand me a case of corona. I wasn’t too fond of corona as a beverage, even less as a virus.</br></br>
 
We are at the height of misinformation age. Whatever this pandemic is, it is not a hoax. My debt to society only requires a certain number of years to be forfeit, not my entire life. This is a deadly virus.</br></br>

So anyone knowingly having the virus to go around other’s who do not have it, is clear and reckless endangerment and is no less than attempted murder. They sent officers from Folsom who didn’t have the virus to prison that at the time were hot spots, and then had them return to their original posts.</br></br>
 
For the most part the inmates perform the majority of work done. When there is a major lock down they resort to critical works. When it's something of their magnitude, the COs are forced to earn their check. Because they are forced to earn their pay they turn around and take out their frustration and anger out on us. This is manifested in so many cruel, unethical and psychological fashions.</br></br>
 
We have been without visits for almost a year, the fallout from just that will rear its head for years to come. In here we are on a different time scheme. So certain simple acts that most take for granted might dictate the entire course for the rest of our lives, something as simple as an in person visit on some random Saturday. We are being treated as if we have gone exploring some cave in China and got into an altercation with a bat.</br></br> 

We are suffering losses like everyone else except we have people intentionally trying to make the situation more uncomfortable than it already is. The free world is the only hope we have, so to sit here and watch what is taking place is very disheartening and upsetting. And top it off with some idiot going out of their way to incite some sort of disruption, this is a potential powder keg.</br></br>
 
We cry foul (write grievances) cause if we don’t cry foul it may end up in a “flagrant foul.” It’s bad for us in Folsom because they are doing things in an arbitrary fashion. They are violating procedures.</br></br>

No one is taking this seriously, but they should because once we have nothing else to lose, then there’s nothing to lose and when it gets there, it’s bad for anyone there.</br></br>
 
I myself have had to use the mental health services behind one of the officer’s turning me into the object of their attention. And all I want is to be left alone to do my time. Even with the overcrowding in our prison system, this is the loneliest place in the world. The only attention I’m getting is from some psychologically disturbed individual. And it’s the wrong kind of attention.</br></br>
 
Under these conditions, it would almost be impossible to rehabilitate a person unless they have an unrelentless will and a support system. Jesus. And whoever else one may turn to in time of need.</br></br>
               
Picture how I’m roll’n but hold’n it down.</br></br>
 
But now I’m being analyzed, mistreated and abused every time they make they rounds.</br></br>
 
(10 days straight. No showers, 10 degree temps!)</br></br>
 
And our main concern was how the free world was coming along.
