Dear PrisonPandemic,</br></br>

May the love, peace, safety and all spiritual blessings from the heavenly places in Christ Jesus be upon you and everyone at Irvine University. I had to wait until I had stamps and envelopes to write so please excuse the delay. I’m fine and I’m in perfect health, although I’m a little overweight. But I’m glad to hear that you and others think about us who are in prison.</br></br>

Having a sentence of life without parole is a sentence of death but thanks be to Jesus and the fact that I’m not the shooter in my crime, he moved people to assert a new law that would allow me to be re-sentenced. Jesus told me in a dream that he would give me one last chance and re-sentencing is the fulfillment, praise Jesus.</br></br>

Around January of 2020 this “Healthcare Prison” started experiencing the COVID-19 pandemic. I cannot be certain exactly how many has died but it has been young and old that has died. The last death because of the COVID-19 pandemic disease was an older person over 70 years old.</br></br>

We have been on quarantine since April 2020. There is no visiting for anyone, limited yard schedules where there is no interacting with other dorms. It is mandatory for all inmates to wear masks and stay six feet apart at all times! Every COVID test I’ve taken has been negative and I thank Jesus for encamping his holy angels around me, keeping me safe!</br></br>

Jesus made a way because of my hardness of heart in 1994 to come to prison. In these 26 years he's allowed me to be born again and filled with the holy spirit! This is my wake-up call to walk with the holy spirit.</br></br>

In Matthew 21:22, Jesus says "whatever you ask in prayer, you will receive"; also in John 14:13-14, "whatever you ask for in Jesus' name, you receive!" Remember these verse when you pray or ask, his word is your seed, your faith is the key, so never doubt. I hope to meet you when I’m out, write me anytime! Praise Jesus!
