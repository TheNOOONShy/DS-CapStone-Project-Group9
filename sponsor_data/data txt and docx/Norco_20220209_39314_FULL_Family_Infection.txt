This story was told by a person incarcerated at Norco.</br></br>

UCI: First question is, what facility are you currently housed at?</br></br>

Caller: Say that one more time.</br></br>

UCI: What facility are you currently housed at?</br></br>

Caller: CRC.</br></br>

UCI: What has the COVID situation been like at your facility?</br></br>

Caller: Overwhelming.</br></br>

UCI: Would you like to elaborate on that?</br></br>

Caller: It's going out of control, everybody is having COVID. I am in a dorm right now with COVID.</br></br> 

UCI: How has the vaccination situation been like at your facility?</br></br>

Caller: Say that, oh, vaccinations situation? I'm vaccinated but they still have people that's not vaccinated with people that are vaccinated. So, it's a weird situation.</br></br>

UCI: How does your facility handle positive COVID cases?</br></br>

Caller: So what they do is, they'll put you in a dorm with other positive COVID cases and we just stuck in there. They give you maybe Tylenol or maybe some antihistamines. Something like an allergy pill and they leave you in here for 10 days. If you're vaccinated you just go right back into general population.</br></br>

UCI: How has the COVID situation at your facility affected your loved ones?</br></br>

Caller: Say that one more time, the recording messed it up. What'd you say?</br></br>

UCI: How has the COVID situation at your facility affected your loved ones?</br></br>

Caller: They are very worried about me because right now, this is the first time I ever had COVID and I am a diabetic. I am high-risk so when I catch COVID or if anybody high-risk catches COVID it's a 80 percent chance that you might go down very hard on it. But I guess I'm great. My immune system was ready for it so it's really not messing me up that much, but I did get a little sick, get a little cough.</br></br>

UCI: How have you been coping with this crisis?</br></br>

Caller: Just very worried 'cause, you know, I don't want to die in here, you know? So, it's - people that have died. Only one person has died so far this year. In this facility.</br></br>

UCI: What do you think would have made the situation at your facility much better?</br></br>

Caller: So, what they did when COVID first hit, they gave us time off and let us go home and if you had high-risk and you were under a year, like I am. They would let you go home on ankle monitoring but I guess this place is not doing that right now. So, I don't know what's going on right now.</br></br> 

Right now, we just on lockdown, everybody is on lockdown. If you're gonna see the doctor or get pills they come into the door. The doctors don't even want to see you. So right now they just answering questions over the phone and then you just stand in a room with 80 people.</br></br> 

UCI: Damn. Well, what else do you want people to know about your experience?</br></br>

Caller: If you do have loved ones thats in jail during this COVID time, please take time out and just find out if they all right because certain people is probably in the hospital right now. Because COVID is very very real and very very strong in these faculties. That's what I would like to [unintelligible].</br></br>
