This story was told by a person incarcerated at John Latorraca Correctional Center.</br></br>

Caller: And so COVID-19, with that happening, we haven't – visitation has been shut down. There's no visits from families or anything like that. The mail - the mail that we get is so backed up, it comes a month late.</br></br> 

We're - you know, we're barely able to – there's a program dorm that we go to. But it's – class is usually shut down. Things are – it's not easy in here. Anything you want to ask, I'm willing to answer. Vaccinations – they barely give em out, really. You know?</br></br> 

They have quarantine dorms where they quarantine people, when you first get in here, for 14 days – seven to 14 days. And then they release them into the pods with everybody else.</br></br>

UCI: I see. And you said that they shut down visitation. How long ago did they shut that down?</br></br>

Caller: Since I've been in custody, it was already shut down. And I was arrest - I was in custody two months.</br></br>

UCI: Okay. So it's been going on for at least two months.</br></br>

Caller: It's been going on for longer than that, from what I've heard from other inmates. And they've been here five, six, seven months.</br></br>

UCI: Okay. I see. And, I'm sorry, did you mention the vaccination situation at your facility?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, yes. They only bring it out when so many inmates have requested for it. It's not – if one inmate requests for it, they don't do it. They have to have enough requests from inmates, all around, for - for them to give vaccinations.</br></br>

UCI: I see. And have you seen them, at all, come to give the vaccination, or does it seem like they're not coming at all?</br></br>

Caller: I've - I've seen them once. I've seen them once since I've been here. And my lawyer was told that they don't allow people inside the facility without vaccinations. But, when I asked a facilitator about that, the facilitator said that my lawyer was lying to me.</br></br>

UCI: Okay. So it seems like you're getting like mixed messages from people.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah. And I'm actually fighting my case that could send me to prison for over six years. And I'm off - I'm off probation, parole – everything. And I'm, you know, fighting this case. They won't release me on the monitor or anything like that because of everything that's going on.</br></br>

UCI: Okay. So you suspect that they might be withholding like your visitation to your lawyer for this reason?</br></br>

Caller: Yes.</br></br>

UCI: I see. And how has the COVID situation in your facility affected your family as well?</br></br>

Caller: They actually – I've had people that got sick with it. My grandma is 70-something years old right now, she's sick with it. And I'm not able to go and see her or – you know?</br></br>

UCI: Right. And so your family isn't allowed visitation. Are they at least allowed any calls or video chats?</br></br>

Caller: They give us a - they give us a phone call, once, every Monday. But it's a five-minute call. If it hangs up or it gets disconnected, it's automatically gone until the next Monday.</br></br>

UCI: Has that happened to you, where you're on the phone for not the full amount of time and it cuts off?</br></br>

Caller: Yes, it has.</br></br>

UCI: Does that seem like it's a common occurrence among other inmates as well?</br></br>

Caller: I would say yes.</br></br>

UCI: Okay. And I'm assuming that inmates have brought it up to the staff. And did they have any response to that, as far as trying to get you guys in contact with your family during this time?</br></br>

Caller: I have - I have no idea with that. I know that, from the few times I was able to get in contact, I was able to contact my brother. But, other than that, I - I don't know.</br></br> 

I mean, they really don't answer back a lot on – there's a thing called, "grievances." We could write a grievance and try to get a response. But-</br></br>

UCI: So it doesn't seem like they're even listening to the grievances is what I'm hearing.</br></br>

Caller: Yes.</br></br>

UCI: Okay. And how have you been coping with the crisis? Are you at all concerned about, you know, your safety in your facility at all, as far as COVID goes?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah. I am, actually. I also have another inmate here that would like to tell his story, if that's all right.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah. That's perfectly fine. As long as he doesn't share any information that could identify him.</br></br>

Caller: Don't say your name or anything that'll identify you. But tell your story.</br></br>

Caller 2: Hello?</br></br>

UCI: And did you already have a story you wanted to share or did you want me to ask you any questions?</br></br>

Caller 2: Sure. Sure, I just - I - I went to jail last time and I wasn't gonna take the COVID shot, and I took the COVID shot, and I got - I ended up in jail. I kinda caught the - a sick a little bit with the flu and I got out and I went over to my friends' house and started feeling better. And - and they ended up - the house ended up getting COVID-19.</br></br>

There was like three or four people that got really sick with the COVID and I was just - I was - and I kept on going by the house, and I was like then I was glad I didn't get - get the COVID from it, so-</br></br>
 
UCI: Oh, so you ended up testing negative, I'm - I'm hearing?</br></br>

Caller 2: Yeah, negative. Like I kept on, I was lucky I took the shot, because I - I don't know if I would've caught the COVID from my friends' house.</br></br>

UCI: That is really good news.</br></br>

Caller 2: Sure is. Yeah, they were pretty sick and they said I - just me and my friends who lived at the house, I didn't get - get - get the COVID, but the rest of them did. And they were really sick last time I was out there.</br></br> 

Yeah, I just came back in jail, but I - we live in a suite, but I - I didn't - I wasn't gonna take the shot at first - but I took the shot right before I left, and I was lucky I did. So.</br></br>

UCI: That's good to hear and you got the shot one-</br></br>

Caller 2: I didn't believe in the shot at first - I didn't believe in the shot at first, but I took the shot and lucky I did before I got out cause I don't know if I would've caught COVID. Yeah.</br></br>

UCI: That's good to hear. Yeah.</br></br>

Caller 2: The whole house had COVID. And they were sick in the room, and they didn't want to go to the hospital, buut they were very sick and I was wondering how they're doing when I get out - I'll be a little bit less weight, but I just want - you know - like I said, a fucking image that aren't you worried about getting COVID from us and I said you know, no really cause I don't believe in it. But that time, should, but that time saying - I'm just glad I took the shot though.</br></br>

UCI: And you got the shot while you were at your facility?</br></br>

Caller 2: Yeah, right before I got out I took the shot, and I was glad I did. Yeah.</br></br>

UCI: And which facility were you at?</br></br>

Caller 2: Arrowhead, in Merced County jail right here.</br></br>

UCI: Okay, that's good. And how was the vaccination process at that facility?</br></br>

Caller 2: They - they give it to ev - all the inmates there. Yeah. If they want it.</br></br>

UCI: So they seem to be offering it to anyone who wants to take it?</br></br>
 
Caller 2: Yeah, yeah.</br></br>

UCI: Okay that's good. And-</br></br>

Caller 2: How are you doin?</br></br>

UCI: I'm good. I'm just trying to get some information about your guys' facility, so we can let the public know about it.</br></br>

Caller 2: Yeah. They take it very serious. We go on quarantine when we come in, at first and they test us, and they give us a shot if we want it, yeah.</br></br>

UCI: Okay that's good, and have you seen any COVID cases in your facility?</br></br>

Caller 2: No. None.</br></br>

UCI: None at all?</br></br>

Caller 2: No. We're pretty fortunate with it.</br></br>

UCI: That is really good to hear. And is there anything else you want people to know about your experience inside of a facility during COVID?</br></br>

Caller 2: I mean, saying I was - I was glad I took the shot and I believe in it and I've - and I suggest people take the shots, yeah. I wasn't gonna take it at first at all, I-</br></br>

UCI: But-</br></br>

Caller 2: I - I blew the shots so-</br></br>

UCI: That's really good to hear, I'm so glad that you had a good experience with it.</br></br>

Caller 2: Yeah, I did. Thank you very much.</br></br>

UCI: No problem.</br></br>

Caller 2: Thank you. I'll let you talk to my other friend right now, too, okay?</br></br>

UCI: Oh, is this a new person?
