Dear PrisonPandemic project,</br></br>

It is a very bad reality in here, and the so-called help is a mixture of perfunctory and empathetic performance, meaning our circumstance is grossly window dressed. The standard of life and safety for inmates is not the same as non-incarcerated citizens. I have been incarcerated over 18 years as a second striker, and I know what I’m talking about.</br></br>

Many lives have been lost under the CDCR administration, but like most times, their dust is swept under the rug. The CDCR has created a death dealing environment, and still maintain authority to take more lives or to release these lives that are deemed more valuable than us left behind. I feel like a disposable product, gold in a repository in which monetary interest trumps life and safety.</br></br>

The realist view of punishment is the excuse that continues to compromise rational performance in the wake of a global pandemic. Shame on the people that allowed the CDCR monster to compromise rehabilitation, and to become one of the most powerful funnels of monetary profit in the US.</br></br>

Smoke and mirrors is the rhetoric of CDCR. It would likely take one million inmate lives to be taken for the CDCR to do the right thing, but not because they care, but because it may present excessive liability interest.</br></br>

How do you really cope with thinking you will die? You have to lie to yourself, and that’s what many of us do. However, I don’t. I see it as it is with no elaborate delusions.</br></br>

If I had a license to run a day care of 50 children, but because of my irresponsibility and negligence, five of those children die. Although it was an accident I would claim, I would still go to jail, lose my license and, be sued.</br></br>

Why is CDCR still in business? Because laws and responsibility don’t apply to them like they do to us. When inmates die, they say sorry, but let the roles shift and their loved ones die, and we tell them sorry. CDCR authority is hypocritical, and unless you experience this horrible contradiction, you can’t fully grasp the true nature of the CDCR agenda, and special interest to their stake holders.</br></br>

Staff come to work, but go home to their families and friends in person, but inmates must visit in a video call for 30 minutes once a month. Staff bring in the virus, come to work with the virus, but inmates are treated as though we’re the problem and the plague. Sorry, safety and security are hollow platitudes used to impose excessive restrictions so staff does less work.</br></br>

There are better solutions for visiting, like opening family visits. There is two units currently, but more waits to be added. Instead of a 48-hour visit, they can give us a 24-hour visit, and one or two family members are allowed predicated upon signing a liability waiver, so CDCR can’t be sued. Marriages and rehabilitation is strengthened by in-person intimacy.</br></br>

The quarantine process here is generic because officers go home every day. All staff are given a weekly COVID-19 test, but all inmates are not. Like I said, smoke and mirrors.</br></br>

I’m not doing good. I gained major weight, I‘m still experiencing symptoms. I still have chest pains, but the EKG and X-ray shows normal I’m told. I don’t trust that. If I get my heart pumping too fast, I feel that sharp pain more so. I use to do 1,000 push ups, 50 to 100 reps a set. It hurts to do fifteen reps and I get winded fast. Say what they will, I know my body and something is terribly wrong.</br></br>

Yes I have informed medical many times, but their ultimate solution is lock me up in a cell and offer a few Tylenol pills. I wasn’t sentenced to be infected with a deadly virus, but CDCR will get away with murder like they get away with everything else. We’re just inmates so our lives don’t count.
