Healthcare for me personally has been good. I’m diabetic, have pacemaker, hypothyroid and a [redacted] mild stroke all being addressed and feel I could get no better treatment elsewhere.
        I admire those of you who go into the medical care profession and wish you all the best. Stay safe especially during this pandemic.
