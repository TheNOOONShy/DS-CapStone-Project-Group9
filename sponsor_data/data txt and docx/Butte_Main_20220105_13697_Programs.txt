This story was told by a person incarcerated at Butte County Main Jail.</br></br>

UCI: So, you talked about, earlier you talked about drawing and everything. Do they have reduced visitations and programs at your prison?</br></br>

Caller: No, they’re not [unintelligible] right now, you can go out and visit through the glass and stuff for a certain amount of time. I think it’s like 45 minutes.</br></br>

UCI: What about the programs?</br></br>

Caller: What do you mean the programs?</br></br>

UCI: Do they offer any programs over there? Like, music classes, anything like that?</br></br>

Caller: Nothing.</br></br> 

UCI: Nothing?</br></br>

Caller: Nothing educational, nothing. We’re just wasting away in the cells.</br></br>

UCI: And the only way you’ve been keeping yourself busy during this pandemic is, you said, drawing and working out or going outside? Like two hours?</br></br>

Caller: I draw all day long. And I work out most of my time. So I work out for three hours straight, and then I wake up in the morning at like seven and draw all the way to one. And then from 1:00 to 2:00 – from 12:00 to 2:00, I work out, and then I come out here for two hours.</br></br>

Then I go back inside, and I start drawing again all the way until nighttime. So basically I sit there and draw all day long.
