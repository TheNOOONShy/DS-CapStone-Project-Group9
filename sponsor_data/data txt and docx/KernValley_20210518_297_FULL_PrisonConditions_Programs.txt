This story was told by a person incarcerated at Kern Valley.</br></br>To the UCI Team, I am a prisoner inside a maximum-security facility. 2013 is the year I got into it with the police, before the many movements that have surfaced. I attended community college where I was the Sergeant of Arms in MECHA 2007-2008. I am a piece of the Chicano Movement inherited by my mother, who is a bilingual educator, We both worked in the fields at the old minimum wages in the Central Valley. Growing up I’ve lived poverty, middle class, and upper middle back to the bighouse.</br></br>The COVID-19 crisis has taken a toll on my family. I lost my Tia who has three sons, originally four, however one committed suicide over a decade ago. I lost my childhood love to a car accident in 2015 right before I was sentenced to a century-plus for defending my life against the BPD. In the past year three close friends have been lost to Fentanyl overdoses. They thought the pills were Percocet. The coronavirus has disenfranchised friends from visiting. We are on lockdown in our cells for two weeks at a time, offered a 10-minute shower every third day of the week. Commissary is denied or ill-supplied. We do get an extra quarterly package a year- that’s a plus.</br></br>I have been fully vaccinated by the Moderna vaccine, still, I wear a mask. I exercise, read, and write to cope with stress. I am the firstborn of six siblings, who are all productive. Besides the trials and tribulations I’m optimistic. I’m alive and forward-thinking. Your concern is appreciated. Focus on the solution !</br></br>

Sincerely.
