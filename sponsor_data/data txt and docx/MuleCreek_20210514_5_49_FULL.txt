This story was told by a person incarcerated at Mule Creek.</br></br>

UCI: Perfect. The time is 5:49. The date is May 14, 2021.</br></br>

Caller: Okay. Do I start?</br></br>

UCI: Yes.</br></br>

Caller: Oh okay. Ah excuse me. Okay. To begin with, right now I thank God very much because I have already gone through this experience, which was very horrible. And I never thought that this could reach me. And I got very sick.</br></br>

They had to quarantine me. And well I was hospitalized for about 15 days and well thank God, as I already said, because He helped me to overcome all of this. And well I had a bit of a bad time. Later when I came out of that I went back to where I live.</br></br> 

And well I spoke to my family and it turned out that my relative too, two died from that. And that made me a little sad. A little depressed. Because my mom and brother died because of that too.</br></br> 

And well I want everyone to know that they are not alone. That there are people who are always looking out for everyone, out there. Like this organization of yours. Who care about you and want to know what your experience has been through this situation.</br></br> 

And all I can say is to keep going, God is going to help us and God is going to get us through this. The relatives that we have lost, are gone. There’s no way to see them again, to change what happened. But I know that like me, many have lost relatives.</br></br>

Their fathers, their mothers, their siblings and it has been surprising because it was not something we expected. Suddenly this came and ended many lives. But hopefully this helps us to become aware and value ourselves and love our families more. Tell them how much we love them, how important family members are to us.</br></br>

 Because when you're out there free, you don't pay much attention to your family. No one says I love you. Dads, moms go to work, and you don't tell them anything. Good luck, or a kiss, a hug.</br></br> 

And when you least expect it a situation like this happens, suddenly they get sick and then you can’t see them. Because of the pandemic you can't visit anyone because you might get sick too. And that's what I want to say. To keep going, that there is a God who will always help us and who will always move us forward.</br></br> 

And many thanks to your organization for trying to look out for us. And it helps many, for you to hear the testimonies that one has here. There are things, more things that I would like to tell you, but I am going to write you a letter so that you can also read my letter and if you want to publish it, that's fine too. Thank you very much for letting me speak these words and I hope they help you much more.</br></br>

And that you keep going. God is going to help us and get us out of this.</br> </br>

UCI: Thank you so much. And um have they given vaccines where you are?</br></br>

Caller: Yes, they have already given us the vaccines. Yes, and I got the, I didn’t want to get the vaccine because I was scared. But I got one dose and I got dizzy. It knocked me down for three days too.</br></br> 

I felt a lot like the flu, a lot of headaches. A body ache, fever. And well, at the three, four days it passed. And then they put the other one on me.</br></br> 

And I thought that would not happen again but it did happen again. They put it on me just the day before. Which was, now it’s Friday, they put it on Wednesday. And right now I’m sore again and I’m going through the flu and headaches again.</br></br> 

Right now I have a big headache. Although this has happened this has stayed stuck in my head. Because I wake up and I wake up with a headache. I have to take a pill. A tylenol or whatever to calm the headache.</br></br> 

And I think that this was left, I think from the injections or from COVID. I do not know. But I did not suffer from that before and right now I am. Every day that I wake up, I wake up with a headache.</br></br> 

I don’t know, I just ask God to help me and to cure me well, and to be healthy. And well, I’m close to getting out and I hope that I come out well and healthy. And to be able to see the family that I have left on the outside. I won’t be able to see some that I love very much, which was my mother and brother.</br></br> 

They were the most important in my life and they are not going to be there but there’s nothing we can do about that. Nothing but to keep going and try to overcome all this. It has been a bad experience but at the same time it’s a lesson that God gave us to pay attention to ourselves and to pay attention to other people. And take care of  ourselves, love each other more.</br></br> 

Try to help each other in everything.</br></br>

UCI: Yes, first God we hope that everything goes well. Um how is it and how was the COVID situation where you are?</br></br>

Caller: Ah well here everyone got sick. There are six buildings here, and of the six buildings, first people started getting sick in one. They took out about 20 prisoners who got sick first. And they put them in another building, in that building they infected the others.</br></br> 

And that’s what they did moving from one building to another until we all got infected. But everyone not one was left uninfected. So they themselves, the same system , caused that. Because if they would have put the first building that got sick, if they had quarantined it, it would not have spread to the other buildings.</br></br>

But they did things wrong because they grabbed those people and quarantined them with other people who were not infected. And that’s how everyone was infected. And the officers when they came from the outside, they were the ones who brought that. And when they were here they didn’t use a mask and we would complain, we would ask them to put on a mask when they came.</br></br> 

But since they are the law, the authority here, what can we do? They do what they want with you and we can only put up with them. And that was how we all became infected. But due to medical errors, that they did not take precautions in that.</br></br> 

And there were a lot of people that passed away because of that. There’s frustration, anger, a lot of anger because they didn’t do things the way they should have. Several people died here when it could have been avoided if they had done things right. But they didn’t do them how they should have.</br></br> 

I only say things that I saw. There may God judge them and God knows what to do in that situation. But it’s sad. And there are many lawsuits because of that.</br></br> 

Because like I said, they did not do things right. And well here they are offering the injection to everyone. Most have already gotten it. There are some who do not want to because they are afraid of the effects it leaves or because of their religion or I do not know.</br></br> 

But there are many who have refused. I was also one of those who was refusing but I thought about it. I spoke with my family and they told me to get it that it was nothing bad, that everything was going to be okay. So I put them on as well.</br></br> 

But yes, in regards to the vaccine, everyone, everyone that wanted to be vaccinated has been vaccinated. Those who didn’t weren’t. Let’s see if they don’t get sick again and make us sick again. Hopefully not.</br></br>

UCI: Yes. And excuse me, I don’t remember.</br></br>

Caller: It seems to me that I have already told you a lot.</br></br>

UCI: Excuse me, I don’t remember if I already asked you what prison you’re at?</br><br?

Caller: Oh, I’m in the Mule Creek prison. In Ione, California. It’s towards the north of California.</br></br>

UCI: Thank you so much for calling us today too.</br></br>

Caller: Yes. I have many things that I can say. That I can tell you about here. And well I know that you don’t, maybe it’s a project of yours that you just have right there. And no, maybe they won’t let you write the people who are here and try to find out a little more about the situation here.</br></br> 

But I think that there would be nothing wrong if someone would write to some of you and let you know more or less the things that are happening here and things like that. Do you understand me, there’s no interest it’s just a friendship, just a friendship on the outside. Try to talk about the things that one is going through in here. I do need someone with whom to write, someone who answers me and tell them about these things.</br></br> 

Can I call you again?</br></br>

UCI: Yes. You can call me. And you can always write too. And now I think they are writing back too. But I don’t know how it takes to receive that.</br></br>

Caller: Oh. Okay. Do you want me to call you another little bit? And keep talking?</br></br>

UCI: If you’d like. If you’d like.</br></br>

Caller: Yes. Okay, I want to talk to you a little more about this. Right now I’ll call you okay?</br></br>

UCI: Okay.</br></br>

Caller: Okay, bye.</br></br>

UCI: Okay, okay. Thank you.
