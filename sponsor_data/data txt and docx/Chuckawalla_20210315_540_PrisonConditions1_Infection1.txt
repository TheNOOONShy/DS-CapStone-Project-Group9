Hi PrisonPandemic,</br></br>

This is my story during COVID-19 pandemic lock-down.</br></br>

My story gone back to 2017, when I got skin cancer, how I got skin cancer, well that is a story not related to COVID-19.</br></br>

So here I go, in 2017 I was diagnosis with skin cancer. It was not so bad at that time, I had it cut out/remove in 2018/2019 and stitch up all was well. And then in late 2019, the scar area where the cancer had been re-open and getting bad. So I saw the prison doctor and he told me that it look like the cancer had return.</br></br>

So as time gone by into 2020 I been in contact with some of the doctors that did my surgery back in 2018, early 2019, that was my first surgery.</br></br>

One of the surgeon told me that my cancer had for sure return and it now look worse then before and getting bigger, but they tell me that they do need to do some test for a more extensive surgery then the last one.</br></br> 

So I told them OK. But you got to tell the prison know when. But at that same time the pandemic was already affecting the surgeries at the hospital I was going to. Then all out going for surgeries from the prison stop because of COVID-19. So I wait and wait but all I got was delays.</br></br> 

Days, weeks, months gone by. My cancer is now eating my face on my left side. As time goes by and I had not heard from no one, no prison doctor or hospital doctors. And now my cancer is out of control and moving under the bags of my left eye and down to my jaw-bone all at that same time.</br></br> 

So now things are looking so bad, that the prison doctor had to do something. He made some calls, to UC Cancer Center and told them about my cancer. That I need cancer treatment now. Now UC Hospital provide me with doctors and other test to help them plans to fight the cancer. They told me it not good and I need to have it remove from a large area on my left side of my face.</br></br> 

I need to get a skin-graft, after surgery to remove your cancer this skin-graft will come from your back. Then to harvest a rib (breastbone) to replace my jaw and another small rib under my breast area for a new nose-bridge. And a eye-lid surgery to put in an important weight because when they gave me my first surgery to remove the cancer the surgeon had damage a nerve that work my eye-lid to open and closes over my eye.
