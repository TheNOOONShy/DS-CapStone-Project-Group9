Thank you for your letter. I received it. About the COVID-19 pandemic, you asked me how do I feel.</br></br> 

At this time I feel absolutely terrible. Even though I tested negative two times, I personally felt kind of sick. But I think it was the regular blues. I felt bad for the people that did get it.</br></br> 

I, myself, do miss my family that used to come and visit me, especially my mother. She wants to see me too.</br></br> 

As far as the program, I don’t really care for it. As long as we can get our store and packages I am good. So it would be nice to have our visits back, and be able to hug our loved ones.</br></br> 

Anyhow, thank you students for your concern on me and the others. I hope your purpose works out and it all goes well.
