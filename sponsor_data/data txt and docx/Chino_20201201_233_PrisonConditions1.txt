This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Chino.</br></br>

I am an inmate at the California Institute for Men in Chino. I am a COVID-19 survivor who spent 12 days in an outside hospital fighting a case of viral pneumonia. My life experiences were horrific - though less from the actual hospitalization and fighting the virus than the host of gaffs, blunders, and outright malfeasance before and after my hospital stay.</br></br>  

I offer the following account of my experiences not to grouse and complain, but in the hopes that they will be used to identify and create solutions to needless problems and suffering by those (like myself) subject to the whims and fancies of the seemingly clueless or uncaring.</br></br> 

When I was transferred to CIM in March of 2018, there were two possible yards in which I could have been placed - "A" yard, or its sister yard, "C". "A" Yard consists of dorms, while "C" yard are traditional 2 men cells. I ended up in "A" 5 - the epicenter of CIM's outbreak.</br></br> 

"A" Yard has 8 (eight) buildings of identical dorms. They are, to my knowledge, unique - as they consist of barracks-like "boxes" open to about 140-plus inmates. The week I arrived, the prison was just finishing expanding each building's capacity by installing additional bunk-beds along each open wall and crowding each entrance/exit door - in violation of CA building and safety codes. One can reach over from his own bunk to touch his neighbors! The non-air conditioned buildings are cooled by two large wall mounted fans at either end of each living area, to create a breeze by circulating the air.</br></br> 

In Jan/Feb of 2020, we all started hearing COVID-19 reports from China/ltaly. I had caught colds, flu, coughs almost immediately upon my arrival here, and commented on the impossibility of us avoiding COVID in our packed "closed-box". I worried because l'm over 60, and previously suffered "walking pneumonia" - both which put me at greater risk.</br></br> 

In April of 2020, the prison moved some 20 inmates from our neighboring unit over to "C, Yard cells as preemptive density reduction. In A5, requests were made for volunteers for "tent living". After volunteers signed up, 'tent housing" was abandoned. Fear of the pandemic increased with news reports on the pandemic outside the prison, and rules about the face masks were announced.</br></br> 

The prison issued "home-made" masks for inmates to wear. They didn't fit, and most inmates refused to wear them inside the buildings. We were made to wear them out on the yard and to/from the chow halls. Their poor fit allowed air to freely flow around the edges.</br></br> 

Prison guards openly violated the Governor's call, while chiding inmates for doing so. (One particular CfO, "Angel" stands out.)
