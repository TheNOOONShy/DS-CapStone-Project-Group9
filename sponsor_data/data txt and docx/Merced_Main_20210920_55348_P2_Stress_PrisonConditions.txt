This story was told by a person incarcerated at Merced County Jail.</br></br> 

Caller: But in here, it's kind of messed up where I don't have control over my own safety. Like it's like I have to either accept it the way they're doing it or pretty much just be without.</br></br> 

You know what I'm saying? And to me, it's - I've been in here eight months and I can't be without, like you know? And so, I feel like that's just, it's almost like I'm - I'm - I'm being hold, like, a hostage with the COVID.</br></br>

Cause I have no control over who's - how they do their work. And they should just be more, more - it's like they're getting comfortable. They're getting comfortable.</br></br> 

I'm not saying they take it as a joke because they obviously see the impact that COVID has had on, in this world, but it's more like they're getting comfortable and they forget. Just seeing how dangerous it is and how easy one of us can catch it, you know what I'm saying? And so, they're - as long as they're safe, I feel like as long as they're safe, that they really don't care what happens to us.</br></br>

We're just inmates. Who cares anyway, right? We're criminals or whatever they want us, you know, whatever they want to think about us, however they think.
