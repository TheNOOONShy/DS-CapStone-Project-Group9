This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Tracy.</br></br>First, I would like to thank you for thinking about us inmates. We often feel forgotten especially during a time like this. My experience dealing with being incarcerated during a pandemic has been pretty rough. I’ve lost four family members to COVID-19 in the last six months.</br></br> 

Losing that many loved ones in a rapid succession has really hit me hard. Grieving in prison is pretty difficult and not having visits and the limited phone calls has just added to the struggle. The way this institution has handled the virus, in my opinion hasn’t been in the interest of the prison population.</br></br> 

They were careless and didn’t protect us by being safe themselves because the only way we’ve contracted the virus was from contact with staff.</br></br> 

I feel our safety was never a priority which is pretty much the norm in any situation. I’m very grateful for your concern and even asking about my personal experience. I hope for the best for us all as a world. Thank you.</br></br>Respectfully.
