This story was told by a person incarcerated at Washington State Stafford Creek.</br></br>


UCI: Hello?</br></br>


Caller: Hello? Hello.</br></br>


UCI: Hi! You were the one that just called, right?</br></br>


Caller: Yes.</br></br>


UCI: Okay, perfect. Did you have anything else you wanted to add, or did you want me to ask you another question, or-.</br></br>


Caller: No, you can go ahead and ask me another question.</br></br>


UCI: Okay, let's see. So, how has the COVID situation affected your family? I know you've already talked a little bit about video visitations, but how are they dealing with everything?</br></br>


Caller: Well, you mean in-. I'm not quite sure I understand the question.</br></br>


UCI: Basically just how have they been coping with, I guess, not being able to come visit you every week or anything like that. Does that make more sense?</br></br>


Caller: Okay, well, my mom is completely disabled in a hospital bed in her living room, on oxygen, dialysis three times a week, and everything else. So, she-. I mean, we would like to be able to get her, you know, to come see me just in case, you know, she doesn't make it until I can get out. So that has been completely taken away. All we have is the video visits and she lives so far out in the country that the internet is just sucks there, so-. You know?</br></br>


UCI: Mhm.</br></br>


Caller: And my girl, it's caused-. There's many times like during the video visits she'll just start crying because she wants to see me, she wants to touch me, and it's just-. I don't know. It just sucks.</br></br>


UCI: Mhm.</br></br>


Caller: You know, when you love somebody and you get used to spending time with them in that little small fashion in the visit room and then that's taken away, it really makes it rough. You know, fortunately, like I said, I'm at the tail end of a long sentence and I'm going home to her. But it doesn't make the time between now and then any easier.</br></br>


You know, and also, I'm not trying to totally bash the DOC because, yeah. They screwed up on some stuff. They could have done things totally different, but they've also done stuff where they're trying to help people like with the three video visits and you know that kind of stuff.</br></br>


They've stopped doing cell searches and all that stuff for, I mean-. They said they were going to start back up but they haven't done it yet, you know? Because they didn't want to possibly transmit and pass stuff around. There's no pat searches up here — hasn't been for a long time. So, they have taken it serious.</br></br>


UCI: Mhm.</br></br>


Caller: So, you know, I just want to make sure that it's not just a one-way bash to the DOC thing. You know, and trust me. I'm not one to stand up for the DOC. I couldn't fucking care less about them, so I'm not trying to pat them on the back either. I'm just trying to be the devil's advocate, here.</br></br>


UCI: Mhm. Yeah, no. I completely understand what you're trying to say. So, I know you've briefly mentioned that they are offering vaccines, but so, have a lot of people been getting them? Are they easy to get? I know you aren't-. You're choosing not to get one for safety reasons, but could you talk a little bit more about the vaccine situation?</br></br>


Caller: Yeah, so when they first started I believe they went around all the inmates were 65 and older and offered it to them. They could either take it or deny it, and after they got done with all of them they basically had a day where they went around to each unit. Let's see. How did they do it?</br></br>


I can't remember if they came into the unit or if it was actually-, went somewhere, but they was basically-. They said, "if you want it, come down and get it." So, anybody that wanted it was able to go get it.</br></br>


UCI: Mhm.</br></br>


Caller: I mean, they have made it readily available. I just choose not to do it.</br></br>


UCI: Yeah, no. I completely understand. Do you know if like a lot of staff members are choosing to get it? I know you say a lot of them have COVID now. Are they-. Is it because they chose not to get vaccinated?</br></br>


Caller: I-. I don't think I can really answer that because that would be total hearsay, you know? It's just the rumor mill and I have no facts to substantiate, you know, an honest, truthful answer on that. So, I honestly, I don't know.</br></br>


UCI: Yeah, okay, no problem at all. Just wondering. Is there anything else you want people to know about your experience?</br></br>


Caller: I don't know it's just-. I mean, this is rough for all of us, you know? I feel sorry for the ones that lost their lives and I think people need to take it more serious than they are. Because there's a lot of skeptical people that still don't believe. I hear people in here, "ah fuck," that this is some kind of rouse and "blah, blah, blah," and it's like, seriously?</br></br>


You know, how can you say that with everything that's going on? Turn the TV on and see what's going on.</br></br>


UCI: Mhm.</br></br>


Caller: You know? But then I also, you know, I watch TV. That's my only link to the free world and I do not agree this push that they're doing out there now trying to get people-. They're basically trying to force people to take the vaccines, is the way I see it. And you're supposed to have free choice of whether you want to do it or not.</br></br>


But, now, if you don't do it, you know, it's sounding like you're not going to be able to fly on a plane, you're not going to be able to go to a university, you're not going to be able to do this, you're not going to be able to do that. And I think that's bullshit.</br></br>


UCI: Mhm.</br></br>


Caller: You know, this country is based on freedoms and being able to have choices and by them trying to force that vaccine and stuff on people. I believe that totally undermines what our country is all about and, you know, what's your right as an American is.</br></br>


UCI: Mhm. Okay, well if you don't have anything else you'd like to talk about with your experience, I just wanted to thank you for calling us and participating in PrisonPandemic. You are welcome to write us as well if you like. Do you have our PO box?</br></br>


Caller: Yeah, I believe it's in the prison legal notes.</br></br>


UCI: Okay, perfect. Well, I just wanted to thank you for calling and if you ever have anything to add, you're welcome to write or call us back whenever you'd like.</br></br>


Caller: Alright, is it possible to ask you a couple questions after you turn the recording off?</br></br>


UCI: I actually, like, it doesn't let me turn the recording off until I hang up. There's not like a button to switch it off.</br></br>


Caller: Oh, okay. So, if I hung up and then called back, would I be able to ask you a couple of questions?</br></br>


UCI: Yeah, no it like automatically records all calls that I have because we're using a specific app and the app just records all of them to make sure we don't miss any calls.</br></br>


Caller: Oh, okay. I see.</br></br>


UCI: Yeah, sorry about that.</br></br>


Caller: Alright. Well, I hope, you know, this call has been helpful to your guys' cause and everything. So where can people like-. If I want my family to be able to check out this website, where is it?</br></br>


UCI: Yeah, of course. So it's-. Do you have like a pen and paper ready or do you want me to give you the website and I can just-.</br></br>


Caller: Like-. I'm just going to type it into my tablet, here.</br></br>


UCI: Okay, just let me know when you're ready.</br></br>


Caller: I'm ready.</br></br>


UCI: It is PrisonPandemic.</br></br>


Caller: PrisonPandemic.</br></br>


UCI: Dot UCI.</br></br>


Caller: UCI?</br></br>


UCI: Yes, that is correct.</br></br>


Caller: Okay.</br></br>


UCI: Dot EDU.</br></br>


Caller: Dot EDU.</br></br>


UCI: And that's the website, it's fully up and running and if you give it to any of your family members they can look and see. As of right now it's just California, but they can see all of the prisons and jails in California and it has all of those individual stories and letters they've written and stuff all on the website already.</br></br>


Caller: Alright. Well, I appreciate you guys, you know, trying to do something and get the word out there and everything because usually it's-. What happens in here is pretty much stuck in here.</br></br>


UCI: Mhm.</br></br>


Caller: You know? And you don't have much of a voice out there, so-.</br></br>


UCI: Yeah, no. Yeah, thank you for giving us your story, it was extremely helpful, any stories are helpful for us. We're just here to listen, basically. So, if you ever have anything else you'd like to add just give us a call or write us a letter.</br></br>


Caller: Alright, so have you guys had very many people calling?</br></br>


UCI: Oh, yeah we've had a bunch. If you-. If anyone looks at the website, there's at least hundreds of individuals that already have their stories up on the website. We usually get maybe, in one night, because we only have like a four hour period each night, we could get up to ten calls depending on how busy the night is. Sometimes we'll just get a few, but yeah we've been getting a lot of stories.</br></br>


Caller: Well, that's awesome.</br></br>


UCI: Yeah, no, it's-.</br></br>


Caller: Well, I'm glad-.</br></br>


UCI: Sorry?</br></br>


Caller: Glad, people are at least reaching out.</br></br>


UCI: Yeah, no, so thank you again for giving us your story, we really do appreciate it.</br></br>


Caller: Alright, well you have a good night.</br></br>


UCI: You too, thank you so much.</br></br>


Caller: Alright, bye bye.</br></br>


UCI: Bye bye.
