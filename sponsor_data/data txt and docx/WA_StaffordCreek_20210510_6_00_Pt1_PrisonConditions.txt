This story was told by a person incarcerated at Washington State Stafford Creek.</br></br>


UCI: So, what has the COVID situation been like at your facility?</br></br>


Caller: Total chaos. I mean, it's-. Once it started spreading I was-. Yeah, once it started spreading, they shuffled everybody everywhere. They took people out of their cells, put them in quarantine, their property got packed up-.</br></br>


They actually put property down in to education to store it for a couple of days. Then, people came back, we got moved to different units, I mean it was just a complete cluster fuck. Excuse my language.</br></br>


UCI: No, yeah. Feel free to say whatever you want to say don't worry about that. And so, you said you caught COVID, when you caught it, did they put you in a quarantine ward, or how did that work?</br></br>


Caller: Well, I was in a unit where it was like ground zero at this facility. And by the time when I found out I had it was because they came through and tested the entire unit and like 90% of the unit had it. So, they started moving people down. Fortunately, I winded up staying in my cell until I got moved to a different unit and I got to keep all my property and take all my property with me. But a lot of people — they went days without having their property, without having a change of clothes, they were having to go into the showers and wash their boxers in the shower, and then free ball it until their boxers dried, so that they could have underwear to put back on. I mean, it was just ridiculous.</br></br>


UCI: Were they giving you guys like masks or hand sanitizer, or anything like that?</br></br>


Caller: Oh, yeah. We were wearing masks. When they first handed out masks, they handed out these packets to us that had two white handkerchiefs, it had coffee filters, it had hair ties, and instructions on how to fold these white bandanas up and put the coffee filters in them and we were supposed to wear those. And then we wound up making these cloth masks out of what was like a sheet or a pillowcase or something with an elastic band, we were supposed to wear those.</br></br>


And then, I don't know whether it was the CDC or what that told them that that wasn't any good. So they started the mandate now that we wear these like medical masks. And they-. Now, they're doing good because they have a box of them at all times up on the COs booth and you can get a new one any time.</br></br>


UCI: So, would you say that the COVID situation's been getting better? I know that you said they're now trying to prevent a second wave, but have they been doing other things to try to make the COVID situation better at your facility?</br></br>


Caller: Well, yes and no, I mean, so, because the fact so many people here got it, and that the numbers have gone down, I mean it pretty much ran its course here. So they have started letting people, you know a certain amount of people go back out to work, they just recently started opening up education again and whatnot. But in the units, they still have us on a split tier because there're two tiers in the units, here.</br></br>


So, it's like one tier will be out for two hours and then they're supposed to go in, and then the other tier comes out for two hours and they sanitize in between, you know? But, on paper they make it sound good but it just, it makes no sense. What's the point in us being on split tier thing in the units when people are still going to work, going to school, and all of that kind of stuff.</br></br>


True. They're doing a limited amount of people at work and a limited amount of people in school and they're doing the whole social distance stuff and all that but it's just-. It's a day late, an hour short, in my opinion.</br></br>


UCI: Mhm. And so I know-. Oh, sorry?</br></br>


Caller: I was just saying, the only reason I believe that they're doing this testing right now and everything is because there's-. I can't confirm it, but rumor floating around is there's dozens of staff here right now that are out of work because they tested positive. So, they-. I think what's going on is, so many staff had tested positive since they've been in here that they're worried that they've brought it in again.</br></br>


But I don't know if you can catch it again after you've already had it or not.</br></br>


UCI: Mhm.</br></br>


Caller: I don't know much information about it.
