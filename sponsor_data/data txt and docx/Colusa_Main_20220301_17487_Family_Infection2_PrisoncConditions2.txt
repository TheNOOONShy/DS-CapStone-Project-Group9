This story was told by a person incarcerated at Colusa County Jail.</br></br>

Caller: Here at Colusa, we’re able to see our family members through the glass. So, however, when we’re in visitation there’s three to four people in visitation and we are mandated to wear our masks and I'm not sure if it's well kept to sanitize before and after we leave the room or not. And then our visitors have to wear their masks, obviously, inside the facility and we’re allowed to have those kinds of visits.</br></br>

Like I said, [redacted] has cut off visits completely because they don’t want to have people interacting, coming in and out, without having, you know, the COVID-19 shots or not wearing the right masks or whatever.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah.</br></br>

UCI: And then, do you know how each facility would handle if somebody tested positive?</br></br>

Caller: So I’ve heard, so someone was showing symptoms here and they put them in a max cell, like a cell by themselves away from general population, and they checked on them and monitored them. I've heard rumors that when they come in and if they test positive, they turn them away, and have to return when they aren't showing the symptoms.</br></br>

Like I said, in [redacted] county they have the women in the same dorms, so they’re in their own rooms, their own cell. But they are still using the same eating area, phone area, tv, showers, and they’re allowed out 20 minutes a day to come out for 20 minutes a day to shower, and to use the phones and then go back to their rooms, not being tested. So we’re not constantly being tested in [redacted], and they’re not constantly testing.</br></br>

In [redacted], one girl caught COVID, this was back in 2020 or 2021, sorry, and what happened was she caught COVID. She was one of the trustees, one of the workers. She was passing out the trays like to lunch and dinner.</br></br> 

And they were still allowing the other three workers that were exposed to her, obviously, working side by side with her, to work in the facility or work with the other, you know, inmates. Taking them, you know, and later that week somebody else became COVID positive.</br></br>

They then removed the girl from the main dorm and put her into medical. However, they took probably about seven hours to move her from her dorm to medical. They did sanitize everything. However, they allowed this girl to talk while she was leaving the dorm without her mask on, putting her germs everywhere. And I don't think the inmates knew how serious that COVID really was at that point or how people were really, you know.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>

Caller: I guess they weren't taking it as serious as it should have been taken. But I'm not sure. I don't, I mean, but there were quite a few outbreaks in this county jail.</br></br>

UCI: Well, this has been a lot of great information. Thank you so much. Is there anything else you'd like to share about your COVID situation tonight?</br></br> 

Caller: No, that's it.
