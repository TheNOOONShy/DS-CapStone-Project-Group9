Even though I've tested negative five times in the past month, I'm still on quarantine to this day. I've been in this prison for nine months and have moved 17 times since I've been here. Also everyone that has tested positive for COVID  after I came back to this yard is already off quarantine. So how does that work?</br></br> 

Also it's been almost a year since I've seen my family and it gets to us all in here. Especially during the holidays, and my mom is not doing too good and I can't even see her in my eyes. My mentality is "fuck it" if I can’t see my family and not for disciplinary reasons. I might as well get in trouble and have a reason why I'm not able to get visits you know?</br></br> 

I'm doing a long time so to me, what's another year?</br></br>

Also since I came back to the yard, they had an outbreak. Three of the five buildings are quarantined. This yard took over D-yard’s  jobs after they had their outbreak and that's how this yard caught it.</br></br>

From here on out I don't want a celly anymore ‘cause I'm going to have to go through this again. So yes I do fear for my health, I had the COVID and I had it bad. A rash from my toes to my thighs, from my fingertips to my whole hand. Fever, loss of taste, smell, headaches, body aches, tired, weak, diarrhea, loss of appetite, and throwing up. I don't want to go through that again.</br></br> 

But during my time on quarantine I spend most of my time drawing for my mom.</br></br>

But I hope this helps you with what you're trying to accomplish. Thank you for your time and reaching out and happy holidays to you all.
