This story was told by a person incarcerated at Washington State Stafford Creek.</br></br>


UCI: So, what has the COVID situation been like at your facility?</br></br>


Caller: Total chaos. I mean, it's-. Once it started spreading I was-. Yeah, once it started spreading, they shuffled everybody everywhere. They took people out of their cells, put them in quarantine, their property got packed up-.</br></br>


They actually put property down in to education to store it for a couple of days. Then, people came back, we got moved to different units, I mean it was just a complete cluster fuck. Excuse my language.</br></br>


UCI: No, yeah. Feel free to say whatever you want to say don't worry about that. And so, you said you caught COVID, when you caught it, did they put you in a quarantine ward, or how did that work?</br></br>


Caller: Well, I was in a unit where it was like ground zero at this facility. And by the time when I found out I had it was because they came through and tested the entire unit and like 90% of the unit had it. So, they started moving people down. Fortunately, I winded up staying in my cell until I got moved to a different unit and I got to keep all my property and take all my property with me. But a lot of people — they went days without having their property, without having a change of clothes, they were having to go into the showers and wash their boxers in the shower, and then free ball it until their boxers dried, so that they could have underwear to put back on. I mean, it was just ridiculous.</br></br>


UCI: Were they giving you guys like masks or hand sanitizer, or anything like that?</br></br>


Caller: Oh, yeah. We were wearing masks. When they first handed out masks, they handed out these packets to us that had two white handkerchiefs, it had coffee filters, it had hair ties, and instructions on how to fold these white bandanas up and put the coffee filters in them and we were supposed to wear those. And then we wound up making these cloth masks out of what was like a sheet or a pillowcase or something with an elastic band, we were supposed to wear those.</br></br>


And then, I don't know whether it was the CDC or what that told them that that wasn't any good. So they started the mandate now that we wear these like medical masks. And they-. Now, they're doing good because they have a box of them at all times up on the COs booth and you can get a new one any time.</br></br>


UCI: So, would you say that the COVID situation's been getting better? I know that you said they're now trying to prevent a second wave, but have they been doing other things to try to make the COVID situation better at your facility?</br></br>


Caller: Well, yes and no, I mean, so, because the fact so many people here got it, and that the numbers have gone down, I mean it pretty much ran its course here. So they have started letting people, you know a certain amount of people go back out to work, they just recently started opening up education again and whatnot. But in the units, they still have us on a split tier because there're two tiers in the units, here.</br></br> 


So, it's like one tier will be out for two hours and then they're supposed to go in, and then the other tier comes out for two hours and they sanitize in between, you know? But, on paper they make it sound good but it just, it makes no sense. What's the point in us being on split tier thing in the units when people are still going to work, going to school, and all of that kind of stuff.</br></br>


True. They're doing a limited amount of people at work and a limited amount of people in school and they're doing the whole social distance stuff and all that but it's just-. It's a day late, an hour short, in my opinion.</br></br>


UCI: Mhm. And so I know-. Oh, sorry?</br></br>


Caller: I was just saying, the only reason I believe that they're doing this testing right now and everything is because there's-. I can't confirm it, but rumor floating around is there's dozens of staff here right now that are out of work because they tested positive. So, they-. I think what's going on is, so many staff had tested positive since they've been in here that they're worried that they've brought it in again.</br></br>


But I don't know if you can catch it again after you've already had it or not.</br></br>


UCI: Mhm.</br></br>


Caller: I don't know much information about it.</br></br>


UCI: So, I know that you said that they're starting education and work again. Are you guys allowed to have visitors, or are they still not allowing you to have family visits?</br></br>


Caller: They actually-. Man, what day was it supposed to start? This month. I can't remember, it's coming up real quick. They're starting in-person visits again but it's no contact, your visitors have to go to the Washington DOC website and schedule a time slot and it's only one hour once a month, but no contact.</br></br>


UCI: Mhm.</br></br>


Caller: They have like flashing lights-. Right now, I'm on the phone, they got these big plastic dividers in between all the phones, you know, to keep like a social distancing partition. And that's the same thing you're gonna have out in the visiting.</br></br>


UCI: Mhm. So, how has it been for you to not have visitation with your family or loved ones?</br></br>


Caller: Oh, it sucks. I mean, before this happened my girlfriend was coming to see me for a year and a half. She was up here once a week and she drives two hours each way — so it's a four hour round trip. And then, like the last six months or so before this happened, she started coming up twice a month just to save a little money because it was so expensive. And then, all of a sudden this happened.</br></br>


Like, I'm at the tail end of a long ass sentence and being able to have those visits, and talk about the plans for when I get out, you know, and everything is-. And another thing that's really messed me up on it is they have-. Well, they're supposed to have release readiness classes that you're eligible for when you get 18 months short, as I've said, I've been down over 27 years.</br></br>


The world has completely changed, I've never seen the internet, I had a pager when I got locked up, I've never used a cell phone, you know? I don't have a clue of the world that I'm getting ready to go into. And I can't even get assistance right now writing a resume. I've never had a resume in my life, so this pandemic is just totally knocked out all my ability to get skills for a successful entry into society.</br></br>


UCI: Mhm, have they said anything about if they're going to start back that release readiness program or is that still just not mentioned at all?</br></br>


Caller: I don't know. They're just passing it back. I've understood as much as I've got a Senator that I'm in correspondence with right now and she's even contacted- reached out, contacted DOC liaison, they told her that somebody would be getting with-. I mean, right now they-. Well, I don't want to give too much information, but they've allowed me time in a computer lab, you know to be able to try to work on my resume, but the problem is, I don't have a clue what I'm doing.</br></br>


UCI: Mhm.</br></br>


Caller: I mean, it's great. Yeah, there's Microsoft Word, there's a template, click on it. But what am I supposed to do with it? I don't even know what the end result is supposed to look like or anything else.</br></br>


UCI: Uh huh.</br></br>


Caller: I know that sounds crazy, but you know, when you've been locked up almost three decades that's what happens.</br></br>


UCI: No, it completely makes sense, I understand what you're saying that you'd be having difficulties making one when they're not helping you with it.</br></br>


Caller: Yeah, I've never had a bank account, I've never had a credit card, I have-. I don't have good credit or bad credit, I don't exist.</br></br>


UCI: Mhm.</br></br>


Caller: You know, I'm just a ghost that's getting ready to come back out in the world.</br></br>


UCI: Uh huh. So, how have you been coping with the pandemic? And like what have you been doing to cope?</br></br>


Caller: Well, I just-. I do a lot of bead work. I do handcrafted bead work and that was something else I wanted to ask about, too because it said something about artwork in the ad that I was seeing. Yeah, I've been doing deed work for about 24 years now and I've got a display in a major mall right now I've had my stuff in an art gallery and the funds that I make from that go into savings that I'm saving out there for my release, you know? So, I at least have something to try to get on my feet with when I get out.</br></br>


UCI: Mhm.</br></br>


Caller: So, I'd just focus on that, you know? I don't even really pay much attention-. I've gotten numb to prison, I've been locked up so long, you know? This place that I'm in now is [redacted]. I mean I'm in a minimum security and I'm grateful because it is so laid back and mellow. I did-. I was in [redacted] for over a decade and that place is so violent I mean it just desensitizes you. So, I just-. I've always been alone and I just keep to myself, mind my own business.</br></br>


UCI: Mhm. So, what do you think could have made the situation better for you and your loved ones?</br></br>


Caller: Well, I don't-. I honestly don't know. I mean like we have JPay up here. I don't know what system they have down-. Because I know you guys used to have JPay down in California but I think they just went to GTL. But, the Washington DOC, in conjunction with JPay, has been offering two free video visits for every person that's on your visit list per week and then discount games, and on Wednesdays if someone sends you a message you get a free reply stamp.</br></br>


So, I mean, they've made an effort to try to allow us to have better communications with our loved ones through all this, so I can't completely knock them. You know? Because they have made an effort across the board here and there, but it's just I don't know, more could have been done in the beginning.</br></br>


UCI: Yeah, no, I completely understand what you're saying. Sorry, I just remembered you had-. You said you wanted to ask a question about artwork?</br></br>


Caller: Oh yeah, because it said something about you guys were interested in art and stuff, too. What's that about?</br></br>


UCI: I think it's just if anybody wanted to send artwork, we're happy to see it, kind of thing. And we can put it up on our website. We're not like selling it or anything like that. It's just basically anything that any incarcerated individual would like to send to us we are more than-. More than happy to, like, accept it and look at it and appreciate it and put it up on the website and everything if that makes sense?</br></br>


Caller: Oh, okay. Yeah, because I'm always looking for outlets, you know, to get exposure for my work out there, so I was curious.</br></br>


UCI: Mhm. Yeah, no. Congratulations on having a sight at the mall that's super like good.</br></br>


Caller: Yeah, I lucked out on that I mean my girlfriend just happened to go into the store and she got talking to the people and they were like we would love to have your stuff in here. So, it's just. I do my best. I've always done my best to try to stay positive and upbeat. I mean, there's positivity in this negative situation. You just have to strive to find it. Too many people dwell on the negative all of the time and I can't do that.</br></br>


UCI: Yeah-.</br></br>


Caller: You disconnected. Can I call back?</br></br>


UCI: Yeah, you're more than welcome to call back either right after this call or whenever you'd like.</br></br>


Caller: Alright, well I will try calling right back since, that way I don't have to get back in line for a phone.</br></br>


UCI: Okay, perfect, yeah. We look forward to hearing from you.</br></br>


Caller: Alright, I'll talk to you in a bit.</br></br>


UCI: Okay, bye bye.
