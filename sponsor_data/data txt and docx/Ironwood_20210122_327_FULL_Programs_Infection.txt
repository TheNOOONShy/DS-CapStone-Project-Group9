This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Ironwood.</br></br>

During this pandemic, it has been a sad and frustrating experience for me. Because ever since the prison cancelled visiting, this has brought me such sadness, due to me not being able to see my family. And if this wasnâ€™t enough the prison cancelled all programs and activities, such as school, library, and all sports on the yard. They have also cancelled all rehab programs.</br></br>

Then to top it all off on August 6, 2020, I came out positive for the virus COVID-19. And I was removed from my cell and yard A and transferred to C-yard ,and placed in quarantine for 21 days in a cell. And this is very frustrating and sad for me.
