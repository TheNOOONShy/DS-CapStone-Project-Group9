This story was told by a person incarcerated at Chuckawalla.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, they, yes, we’re required to wear facemasks out. Once we’re outside of our living quarters like when we’re in the dayroom I'm wearing a facemask, when I go to yard, I'm supposed to wear a facemask, when I go to chow stuff like that, medical.</br></br>

But other than that, when I'm in my cubicle, I cannot, I don’t have to wear it. But I do anyways. And they do provide us with hand sanitizer but it's just one like one. They have a supply of them. Everybody uses it, but sometimes it's hard to get a refill.</br></br>UCI: Do you see staff also adhering to wearing masks and doing things of that nature?</br></br>Caller: Yeah. For the most part, yes, but you get some of them that come from another yard like right now there's two other yards that are infected, have an outbreak and they’ve got two buildings locked down. And those officers will sometimes do overtime shifts on our building and they won’t be wearing facemasks and stuff. Instead, they’ll be talking right there, coughing everywhere you know it's crazy. But then they get mad at us cause we don’t wear our facemasks. Sometimes we forget and they’ll start yelling at us. But when we tell them something they you know they just get mad.
