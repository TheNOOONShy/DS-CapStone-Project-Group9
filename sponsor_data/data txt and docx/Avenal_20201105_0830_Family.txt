This story was told by a person incarcerated at Avenal.</br></br>Caller: I just think there's some you know some added stress there. I mean with them already dealing with it out there and you know being locked down and seeing-, and kinda seeing the inconsistency that’s been going on in here. That’s kinda just been kind of I think concerning.</br></br>You know when I talk to my parents or anybody in my family you know it just seems to you know that they don’t understand it but at the same point you know there’s not much you can do.</br></br>But I mean kind of just look out for and try to take your own personal precautions that you can by wearing your mask and trying if you know that an inmate maybe has tested positive or you know or there's a situation, there's something you can do to try to protect yourself and others you know trying to take that standpoint.</br></br>You know just to not be that spreader or be that person who you know affects somebody negatively. And just always kinda to reassure my parents too you know that I’m safe and you know I'm just trusting in what God’s doing here and you know, knowing that he’s in control of all things.
