Hello,</br></br> 

Thank you for this thoughtful message, and your team for making my voice heard.</br></br> 

It’s been hard for us in here. Especially for those who have loved ones like I do. Having no visits has been stressful. It's not the same as talking with them through the phone.</br></br> 

There is times when the Global Tel Link Company gives us free phone calls, but the COs do not honor them and decide not to run program. Lately, they have been running program. But some days we get burned for yard or dayroom, so we’re stuck in the cell all day. Sometimes showers aren’t even honored.</br></br> 

Masks are required and we keep them on when we are outside of our cell. My safety does not feel threatened because the COs do their best to have us keep our distance. I do feel they are doing a good job in keeping us safe against the COVID-19.</br></br> 

A lot of us have lost our loved ones to the pandemic. No visits makes it harder because we don’t get to grieve with our loved ones. A hug from a family member makes a huge difference in our life. A lot of inmates feel stressed out. A lot of them get impatient and cause trouble.</br></br> 

The way I’m coping with all of this is by writing my family a lot of letters, letting them know that I love them and that I’m okay. That way I won’t stress them out too. Because my family worries about draw to relieve my stress or from stressing on my family. Reading a book works sometimes, or listening to music.</br></br> 

Thank you and your team for what you do. Thank you for making our voices heard.</br></br> 

Best wishes.
