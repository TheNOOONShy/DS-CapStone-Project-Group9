This story was told by a person incarcerated at Mule Creek State Prison.</br></br>


Dear PrisonPandemic,</br></br>


Greetings and good afternoon to you. I am reaching out to you and yours in regards to this surprising and wonderful letter I received from you this past week. It’s not everyday that a complete stranger or just random people in our communities reach out to individuals who are incarcerated so, I want to thank you just for that.</br></br>


Well, from what I understand you are interested as well as concerned in what the “coronavirus” has done to the incarcerated? The protocol they allegedly were supposed to follow, the  conditions that we faced while having to deal with the virus as well as everything else that comes along with the prison environment.</br></br>


Well, first and foremost I welcome your interest with open arms and I’m very happy to help assist anyone who is concerned with the human race in general, let alone the incarcerated many who have to deal with adversity on a daily basis. I will do my best to condense my story for you; however, I just want to warn you that I have been incarcerated for over 25 straight years on a 3rd strike nonviolent offense so please be patient with me because I would like to share my story with you and yours.</br></br>


I am a native Southern Californian, San Fernando Valley to be exact. The reason why I’m sharing that with you is, I am familiar with Sunland and UC Irvine. So.</br></br>


Well, allow me to fill you in on the “COVID-19” crisis we had to deal with before I get into anything further. I was following the pandemic on T.V. until November 2020, that’s when the virus touched down in our facility. Some free staff tested positive for “COVID” so staff locked down the program, our protocol so we were restricted from everything–– no contact visits, phone calls, no work, no programs.</br></br>


Then inmates started testing positive for “COVID,” then in no time, the virus spread throughout the block. So, staff and medical tried to control the spread by moving inmates with the symptoms out to a quarantined area. Now this separation took place over a 3 month period, I happened to catch COVID-19 in February of this year which they quarantined me for 10 days.</br></br>


However, the area wasn’t practicing any of the protocols, no masks, no social distancing, no doctors, they just rehoused us for the 10 days then sent us back to our original cell. Whether you were still ill from the virus the prison system started to allow phone calls, showers, still while we were locked down, however no visits.</br></br>


I must admit, the virus didn’t hit me as hard as I thought it would for someone being in their early 50’s. I was only sick for 3 days. It did take about a month and a half to receive my initial vaccine shot, which got me sicker than the actual virus itself. Gradually as more of the population received the vaccinations the more programs we started to get; however, you can’t take away the fact that the manner in which the state handled the “coronavirus” was terrible.</br></br>


The prisoners become ill from staff who didn’t practice proper safeguards in the first place which basically contaminated the prison system with the virus. I honestly think the CDCR should have done more to protect the prison population before and after. I was really trying not to catch the virus due to the fact that they weren’t prepared to help you. However, I ended up weathering the storm. I would be interested in sharing more with you when time permits so just reach out again when you can.</br></br>


I will respond in kind when that time comes, so once again, thank you for reaching out and offering a helping hand. Hopefully my story can be of some assistance to you. Continue your good work and I look forward to hearing from you in the future. Before I go, I would like to let you know that I filed a grievance against the administration due to this negligence with care concerning the virus in custody.</br></br>


Respectfully.
