On December 2, 2020, I tested positive for COVID-19. On December 6, 2020, I was moved to the quarantine unit. A dorm filled with bunk beds and about 180 people that tested positive for COVID-19. On December 9, 2020, this elderly guy told the nurse he was having breathing complications and requested oxygen. The nurse told him that he would be seen the next day.</br></br> On December 20, 2020, it was pill call in the morning. The elderly man who needed oxygen normally took pills. The officer went to check on the elderly guy as to why he wasn’t getting up for his pills, he was dead.</br></br>On December 17, 2020, my quarantine time was clear and I was resolved of COVID-19; I went back to my housing unit. It should be noted that from December 17, 2020 throughout December 27, 2020 there wasn’t any COVID-19 test being administered or no vital signs checks. On December 22, 2020, I received a “Kit am COVID” ducat.
