This story was told by a person incarcerated at Chowchilla.</br></br>

Caller: Current - the current situation is, we - there were various newspaper articles printed by our administration in the real world. The free world is what we called it. And almost all the things on there were not accurate. They were stating that the transfers had stopped.</br></br> 

They stopped for a little while, they continued a majority of the time the whole year that we’ve been out. They continued most of the time. They only stopped within the last three months, and they started right back up again.</br></br>

So to speak, for today, we have orange people and people that are in reception centers and living in our C-facility. Different things different people have come here. We have transgenders that were transferred into prison, and they did 14 days on A-yard.</br></br> 

And now they’re living with us, within us. Within our, you know, sub-community and stuff. So, you know, the actual transferring of has been more of a headache than anything else.</br></br>

Because when COVID kicked based on the doctors and nurse that infected over 700 inmates today, we were all relocated different places. People lost all of their properties that they had for years. We were told, “Oh, you’re only gone for two weeks, so leave all your property behind." People were threatened, people - some people received Kronos note. Stating that they could come back to their housing units after the fact.</br></br>

It was just a whole bunch of nobody knew what to do, and the person in charge of it was our AW named, and his thinking logic just became unbearable for the inmates. He stressed out our staffs, our correctional officers that had to put in the bedrooms, and locate us, and relocate us and get us back and get us down there and all these different things. We didn’t have proper equipment to relocate our property with the six cubic feet that leaves.</br></br> 

We didn’t have that. Our hygiene and our food is not combined in the six cubic feet. Your personal things like your boombox, your television, your J-pay tablet, your clothes, those kind of things. You know, your college work, your attorney’s paperwork, all that kind of stuff. Being dragged around, from pulling and post with them.</br></br>

The living conditions themselves were, they were advertised that they had cleaning crews, there were no cleaning crews, they were basic inmates. They had no cleaning. They didn’t even know what cross-contamination was. Taking one rag from cleaning the telephones that had been used and using it on all the telephones.</br></br> 

That’s cross-contamination. These are the properties that we lived through that people are still living through. But they could create a janitorial, something just the prison, not connected with PIA that they had not done it.</br></br>

So, people are still getting infected. We have like six a day. One lady died. She was never advertised, we never make it to the news on what’s going down in our prisons.</br></br> 

Far as how many people contracted it, we were never included in the Moderna count to our knowledge. And this is how we’re living. Like, people are pretending one thing on paper, and it’s not the reality of what we’re living through.</br></br> 

So, on basis, the officers are now mad when you speak up and defend yourselves. With [unintelligible] to, but now they’ve started generating their own propaganda. To answer to, do away with the 602 process. “Oh no, we issue Sani-guards”.</br></br> 

The difference between issuing Sani-guards and cell block [redacted] is that Sani-guards is not carcinogenic. [Unintelligible], which is supposed to be Raid, as a disinfectant, deodorizer, whatever, whatever, that is a carcinogenic. So why would we want to use that? The officers use Sani-guards, so why not we use Sani-guards? [Unintelligible].
