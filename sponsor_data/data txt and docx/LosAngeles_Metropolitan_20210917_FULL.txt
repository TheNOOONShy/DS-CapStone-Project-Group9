Hello, how are you? Nice to meet you! I’m so happy someone reached out to me about this.</br></br> 

I caught COVID twice. I’m 45 years old, I’ll be 46 in September. I met all the criteria under the CARES Act. Which [redacted] prescribed and yet prison officials never considered putting my life before my sentence.</br></br>

Let me explain, I’ve been down for seven years. I received a sentence for a gun. A gun that was mine in name.</br></br>

I’m not a creep or sex offender or anything like that. In the contrary, I’m a father of two. I have a daughter that is 24 years old and a 16-year-old son.</br></br> 

I’m from [redacted] California, which is on the East side of the city of Angels. I’m Mexican American and thank my God I’m healthy.</br></br> 

I came to the feds in 2018, I’ve actually been down for six years and a half. But I’m on my seventh, ya get me? I got busted in 2015 at that time I had just got out of my federal custody for a gun, which was also in my name.</br></br>

I used to be a collector. I became a felon and that caused problems for me. I’ve been shot three different times and so carried the weapon for protection. I’m not the kind of person that the police help not even if I have COVID.</br></br>

At the same time I was in a United States Penitentiary in Atwater Ca, by Fresno. The first case of COVID landed about ten minutes from the joint I was at. We seen it on tv but for sure I didn’t take it serious. I was consumed with my sports, March Madness, and Kobe had just died.</br></br>

I used to drink really heavily and I had quit in 2017. I was making moonshine and it blew up on me, so I got burnt really bad.</br></br> 

I went to the hospital for almost two months received skin grafts on my chest, back, arms, shoulders. The plastic surgeon fixed my face, you can’t really see any scars. And I didn’t lose my tattoos.</br></br> 

But I’m on Suboxone. So when we seen it on tv we paid it no mind. We got locked down, and I get so sick headache, fevers, bones, etc. I thought I was gonna die.</br></br> 

I never once thought COVID, three days later it was gone. The whole prison got sick. Then, they locked us down.</br></br> 

About six months later I developed a heart condition. I thought I was having a heart attack. Now let me tell you I’m in great shape. I don’t eat junk or fat and work out hard.</br></br> 

Then, I read an article in "Wall Street Journal" about a COVID study in Germany with patients over 40. I think over 70 percent developed heart problems.</br></br> 

Then we had another outbreak in November. I caught it again. That’s when I knew for sure I had it.</br></br> 

This was only one day, and I had a fever and a headache. I did not notice the virus had behaved the not only gave it to us but failed to protect us or even help us.</br></br> 

I go home in 60 days. I’m so glad you care enough to reach out. I can draw. I will send you some copies. I draw for money so it will have to be copies.</br></br> 

I would love to help you in any way I can and answer all questions you might have. Once, I’m released it will be easier to politics ya get me?</br></br>

I have a lot of insight. I’ve read a lot about it plus I have seen it first hand. I’m a Trump supporter and so I seen how the news used fear to pump it up.</br></br>

The masks are a joke and I also seen how fear made people sick. China played a major role in unleashing this bio weapon on us. I encourage you to trust in God. And I don’t take the vaccine.</br></br>
