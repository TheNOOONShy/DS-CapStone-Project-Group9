This story was told by a person incarcerated at Amador County Jail.</br></br>

UCI: Oh, okay. And what has the situation been like at your facility?</br></br>

Caller: What are the situations like?</br></br>

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: What situation?</br></br>

UCI: The COVID situation.</br></br>

Caller: The COVID situation is – has come through here, and everybody – everybody has either got it and got the shot or got it and got over it.</br></br>

UCI: Hmm.</br></br>

Caller: No one's suffering from COVID right now, but it came through here and everybody got it. Well, almost everybody.</br></br>

UCI: Mmhmm.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah.</br></br>

UCI: And has there been reduced visitation or programming due to the spread of COVID?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, yeah, there's – there's been no visitation and there's no yard. We – there's been no yard for over a year. You know, like you go outside or whatever?</br></br>

UCI: Mmhmm.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah.</br></br>

UCI: I'm so sorry to hear that. Has there been anything you've been doing alternatively to cope with the way the pandemic has been affecting – affecting your experience?</br></br>

Caller: No, not really. There's – it – it's so small here. The whole – the whole little section I'm in, it's tiny. There's two, four, six, eight, there's 12, 13, 14 guys in this room, and it – it is so small. You wouldn't – you wouldn't believe how – how close – how – how small it is.</br></br>

UCI: Mmhmm.</br></br>

Caller: There's not much to do. You can read. That's about it. Or you could talk with someone on the phone.</br></br>

UCI: And – and how have you been coping with the crisis?</br></br>

Caller: Coping with the crisis?</br></br>

UCI: Mmhmm.</br></br>

Caller: I don't know. I probably just – I didn't catch it. That – that was – everybody else caught it. I wasn't here, and I came back and everybody had had it and it was gone, and I – I've been here and I haven't – I haven't got it at all. I got the shot. So I don't know. I've been coping just probably just by ignore – like, ignoring it like it's not even happened.</br></br>

UCI: And is there anything you think your facility could have done better to ease any of the troubles from the situation?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, they could have give us some way – some way to get outside. Being – being locked inside 24 hours a day for over a year now is – is tough.</br></br>

UCI: Mmhmm.</br></br>

Caller: There should have been some way to get outside for a little bit of time.</br></br>

UCI: Mmhmm. Well, thank you so much for sharing. Is there any other thing you – you would like people to know about your experience?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, there's a lot of people in here that don't have people to talk to, and they're going through – I don't know how – I – I have someone that I care about and I figure who cares about me, but there's a lot of people that are in here that are all alone.</br></br> 

UCI: Mmhmm.</br></br>

Caller: I don't know how they really feel about – I don't know how they really feel about if – if they're scared, if they're scared for family or – or what. They – they probably deal with it a lot inside themselves.</br></br>

UCI: Mmhmm.</br></br>

Caller: That's probably – that's probably one of the worst things, the – someone worried about something, and they don't let nobody know, and they just quietly worry about it themselves.</br></br>

UCI: Mmhmm.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah.</br></br>

UCI: Well, you know, you can always share our information with anyone else you think may want to share something. Any of your friends or anyone you think would be interested in it. We – we're here to listen and we're – our goal is to bring attention to what's going on, you know?</br></br>

UCI: Mmhmm. Well, thank you so much for participating in PrisonPandemic. If you ever want to share more, you know, you could always call or write a letter to our P.O. Box, but thank you so much and consider – please consider telling your friends about us and seeing if they would like to call in as well, okay?</br></br>
