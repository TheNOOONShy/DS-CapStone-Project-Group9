Well as for me, I am a 52 year young Black man, will be 53 in January. Praise God. This pandemic is a very scary situation. There are over 1,500 people who are infected with COVID-19 and still counting.</br></br> 

We are housed in a nine by four foot cell with two people to a cell. Bunks are stacked together with one toilet and a sink. No tables, no where to sit, no ladders to climb on the top bunk. We are on shelter in place, so we are lock down 24 hours a day.</br></br> 

Every three days out for a five minute shower, no phone.</br></br>

We eat in our cell all three meals, we are really living like animals. There is no social distance. Especially in your cell, you have to take off your mask to eat, no privacy when you use the bathroom. It is very humiliating and very depressing.</br></br> 

Everyone has mental health problems. It is a outbreak here, now they are building tents outside in the used to be yard and putting people out there in the winter time.</br></br>

So it is 6:30 am is when my day starts off. I get woke up by the nurse to take my seizure and pain medication. Upon arrival here in 2018 I was placed on a top bunk and was refused my seizure medication, which cause me to have a seizure in my sleep falling five feet to the concrete floor. Now I have permanent damages to my back, shoulders, and arms, and neck because the nurse did not put my medication in the computer.</br></br>

I am just thankful to be alive so now I sleep on the floor because I have bad dreams of falling out of the bed. Now I have PTSD so I am in a cell all by myself, me and God the Father, God the Son and God the Holy Spirit, amen! So it is very good that I believe in the Bible. That is where I get my strength from everyday.</br></br>

Noon and night I read, study, and pray for other people.</br></br>

I want to help people and encourage them that this too shall pass, so we must keep God first. What I have learn is to love God with all of your heart, mind, and soul, and love your neighbor as you love yourself.
