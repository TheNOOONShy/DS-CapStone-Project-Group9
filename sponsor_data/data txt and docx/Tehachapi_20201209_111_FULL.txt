To UCI student</br></br>  
Hello, I was told about the PrisonPandemic Project through my celly. Man, you don’t know how great it is to have someone to write just to see how we are doing.</br></br> 
As soon as this pandemic started, we lost all of our programs. We are lucky to get to be outside one time every three weeks. Even then, we are only out there for two hours. The rest of that time we're all are in our cells.</br></br>
Being stuck in my cell like this is effecting me mentally, emotionally, and physically. When I got COVID I wasn’t treated, they just kept me in my cell, nothing else. Other people are getting it also. They need treatment but they don’t get it.</br></br> 
I’ve had multiple family members pass away because of COVID. I only have one year left until I'm able to go home. But being caged in my cell the way I am... I feel like it's going to effect me mentally. And for visits being canceled like this really sucks. You know that’s what we all look forward to on the weekends. But visits being taken just makes everything even worse.</br></br>
Well thank you for listening to what I have to say. It's amazing that anyone even cares about what we are going through. So thank you.</br></br>
Write back if you would like.</br></br>Best wishes.
