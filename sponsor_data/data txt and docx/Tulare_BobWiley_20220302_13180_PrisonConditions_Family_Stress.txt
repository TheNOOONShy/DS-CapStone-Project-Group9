This story was told by a family member of someone incarcerated at Tulare Bob Wiley Detention Center.</br></br>UCI: Do you think, do you feel like there's anything that the facility could have done to make the situation better for you and your sister?</br></br>Caller: Well, I definitely feel like they could have given her vaccine sooner. And as far as visits go, like I have, I really have no idea why they couldn't let us continue to have in person visits, when everything else around us was opening. I don't know if it's like a lack of employees or what it is. But to me, it just feels like you know, they've gotten used to not having to do it.</br></br> 

And so, why do it if they don't need to. And they see, possibly the technology is, you know, like, Oh, why do they need in person visit if they can see each other this way? So, but also, there's the clear concern about my sister getting sick, so they could definitely be wearing masks. I mean, I think that's the easiest thing that they can do to help.
