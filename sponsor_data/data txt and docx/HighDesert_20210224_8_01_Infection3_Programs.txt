This story was told by a person incarcerated at High Desert.</br></br>

Caller: I’m not sure if it’s costing them a lot of money as far as to test us, but they stopped doing the nasal swabs for a while. And they were just doing the temperature check and I guess check our temperatures with some device that they use to put closer near our head and another that clips onto our fingers. And then in some occasions, they wouldn’t wipe them.</br></br> 

So a lot of the inmates were touching the same thing. And the thing was that even people who were quarantined now they’re no longer taking- they're permitted, they have the option to stay in the block. So those individuals when they get sick they start getting everyone else sick and from the way I see it, and the way a lot of us see it, is that they’re deliberately trying to get us sick. And we know the institutions get a lot of money off of that so we’re thinking they’re trying to milk it.</br></br>

Because by them in doing that they allow us- they have the upper hand on us and we’re not able to program. Right now we’re like on a modified program which just indicates that we’re only permitted to move around within our section which is called a dayroom and we only get phone calls, shower, and use the kiosk. But aside from that, everything’s in cell so we’re not given strong disinfectants and that’s another issue. We do have masks, we do have gloves, but it’s not stopping the spread of the virus. So as far as the way they’re managing it, it’s done very very poorly.
