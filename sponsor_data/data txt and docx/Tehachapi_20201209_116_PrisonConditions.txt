Everyone (inmates) around me are getting sick from coronavirus. CDC cannot do much to keep us safe. Staff are getting us sick. But I don’t think they can do anything to prevent the virus to getting to us. Unless they put everybody in cells. They (CDC) don't have enough room for that. Family and friends are all gone. I had a pen-pal, but she lost too many of her family members to this pandemic, so she doesn't write anymore. So life for me is not good for me at all! My future is just a big dark cloud. They try to say that “everybody’s life matters.” This is not true.
