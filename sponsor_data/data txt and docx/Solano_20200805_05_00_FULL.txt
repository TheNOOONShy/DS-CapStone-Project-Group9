This story was told by a person incarcerated at Solano.</br></br>

UCI: Okay. Thank you. And so our questions are, first, just kind of very general. Like what's going on at your facility with COVID right now?</br></br>Caller:	Well, they're Ð they've quarantined a few places, as far as like that Ð laundry and optical. And then, if a guy in like one of the dorms catches Ð I guess, if he tests positive, they quarantine Ð they send that whole dorm out to the gym or you've got to settle for quarantine. But this, to me, has been run kind of ragged, though.</br></br>The whole process of what they're doing, as far as quarantine, is kind of Ð it's not really keeping people away from each other. And then, the tests they've been running, it's like they say somebody's positive, but, then, come to find out that they weren't positive at all.</br></br>UCI: That sounds pretty difficult and a bit stressful.</br></br>Caller: Yeah, it does. And, where like Ð where I work at Ð I work in laundry And we have stuff coming in from San Quentin. And, at first, you know, the guys that handled it right off the truck, they weren't even wearing hazmat suits.</br></br>But, now, they got them wearing hazmat suits when it comes through. You know?</br></br>UCI: Yeah. That would be scary. That has to be a scary sight in itself.</br></br>Caller: Oh, yeah. That's, you know, dealing with San Quentin and hearing about what's going on over there. You know?</br></br>UCI: Have you had people test positive there and quarantine?</br></br>Caller: Well, to me, I mean what they Ð they've really been kind of loose when it comes to really admitting if somebody tests positive.</br></br>Like, where I work at, like I say, laundry, they quarantined our whole job site and put us in the gym on the Level 3 side. Because they thought somebody might have tested positive. Then, come to find out, the guy didn't actually test po- they Ð I don't know Ð they saw some kind of false positive Ð negative Ð something they're doing, where they're saying a guy is testing positive. Then, when it comes out, he didn't test positive at all. But guys are being Ð some guys are being inconvenienced by getting quarantined in the gym.</br></br>You know? They're moving all our property over there. Stay over there for ten to fourteen days. You know?</br></br>UCI: Yeah. And, with what's going on over there, what kind of troubles you the most or concerns you the most?</br></br>Caller: Well, what it really is, like they had my building on quarantine. And quarantine, you know, is just staying in. But they had us going to the kitchen, where we're running into other inmates. You know what I'm saying?</br></br>If we're supposed to be quarantined, you know, you would think we wouldn't run into nobody else. You know? So they had us going to the kitchen to eat. You know what I'm saying? But, then, the staff Ð sometimes, the staff Ð they're not respecting the part of wearing a mask, when, you know, when, in actuality, they have the greatest chance of bringing it in to us if we're not going anywhere. You know? To me, they don't take the mask serious. You know? As far as, you know, they'll tell us, you know, "Hey," if somebody has their mask hanging too low, "Put your mask on." You know?</br></br>But they're not wearing their mask all the time, neither. You know?</br></br>UCI: Yeah. That must make you nervous. Because they're the ones ...</br></br> Caller: Yeah.</br></br>UCI: ... who are going to bring it in.</br></br>Caller: Yeah. That's the whole thing, you know, a lot of us talk about in here. You know? We know we're not going anywhere. I haven't went outside these walls. You know? And then, one thing they do do, if a guy goes outside to a outside hospital and he stays overnight, then, they quarantine them when they come back. But, if you just go over there for the day and you come back that same day, then, they'll bring you back to the building. You know?</br></br>UCI: And has COVID really interrupted your normal life there? I mean it sounds like it has a bit.</br></br>Caller: Yeah. Because, where I work at, right now, since we were Ð see, my building, we were on quarantine. So a few of us that work in the laundry, we had to go to work within the last two weeks. And then, as far as the program goes, it's Ð the canteen is getting kind of Ð where we go shop and buy our food at Ð it's kind of messed up.</br></br>Because, one of the staff members at the canteen had came up with COVID. So they shut the canteen down for [unintelligible]. But the canteen's running a little slower. You know? Our program, as far as how they run, dinner is a lot slower. Everything get slowed down. You know? You kind of expect that, because you see it happened in the outside world, too. You know?</br></br>UCI: Yeah.</br></br>Caller: But it's, you know, it gets kind of stressful, especially, when they put us on quarantine in those, you know Ð I mean the tests are good.</br></br>But it's like I done tested five times within the last, probably, month-and-a-half. And, one time they tested, they said something happened with my test and they had to retest me. And then, they're real mysterious about giving us our results. You know?</br></br>UCI: You don't get them right away? Or ...</br></br> Caller: Uh-uh. They take Ð well, when they had to test me by myself, after everybody had been tested, they said everybody was negative. It took like ten days to get the results.</br></br>And, after that, they had to retest me because they said something happened to my test. And then, I went over there, I got tested. And they did something with a liquid in the tube and shook it up. And they gave me my test within 15 minutes. But everybody else's test is taking like up to two weeks before we get our results.</br></br>UCI: Oh, wow. Yeah. That must be hard to just be sitting and waiting to see results.</br></br>Caller: Yeah.</br></br>Yeah, it is. Yeah. That's a lot Ð there's a lot of guys get stressful about it, especially, when were at Ð when we were waiting to get our results back and they had us going to work still. They figured, since they put us all together, they could send us to work Ð which we were doing anyway. You know? Then, they got mad when we were demanding that we get our tests back. You know? And then, they started, you know, lashing out about that. Like they wanted to, you know, write people up. Protest. All we wanted was some answers to our test.</br></br>UCI: Oh, wow. So they were threatening you with a write-up just for ...</br></br> Caller: Yeah.</br></br>UCI: ... trying to get your test results back.</br></br>Caller: Yeah. Yeah. So, you know, that was kind of stressful. But, if you got a write- that's because we, you know, they had us going to work. But we were going to work out of Ð you know, we were living in the gym, basically. And we weren't where we usually live at in our dorm. So we were wondering what Ð we going to work Ð why we can't go back to our dorms. So, that same day, they ended up moving us back.</br></br>UCI: How do you feel about the information you receive, in general? Does it help? Is it comforting?</br></br>Caller: I mean they're giving us the information that we're getting, as far as, you know, what to do and everything. It seems like the right way to do it. It seems like, by paper, it seems right. But it's just their actions are different from what it says on papers. You know?</br></br>UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>Caller: Just by the way they treat us and how they're running everything. It just doesn't seem right, as far as that. But, as far as you see all the information Ð the pamphlets they've put out about the COVID-19 and everything Ð all that is, you know, it's cool when you read it.</br></br>But, when they actually do things, what they're supposed to be doing, it's different.</br></br>UCI: And has COVID been handled differently at the beginning of the outbreak to now at your facility?</br></br>
Caller: It seems like, you know, it seems like just the way Ð just like the way it was taken out there on the streets, as far as the administration and the higher levels, as far as like the prison.</br></br>You know? They didn't take it too serious, it seemed like. You know? Even like how they did with San Quentin. They transferred some guys into San Quentin when they weren't supposed to be doing any transfers. You know? And then, they sent some guys from Chino, where it was real bad, out to San Quentin. And, just like here, it was like four busses that came here when they weren't supposed to be doing any transfers.</br></br>UCI: Oh, wow. That must have been scary to have busses come ...</br></br> Caller: Yeah.</br></br>UCI: ... from other places.</br></br>Caller: Yeah. And that's the whole thing, especially, the one that happened at San Quentin, where the guys were really bad in Chino.</br></br>And, now, it seems like San Quentin has gotten bad now.</br></br>UCI: Yeah. That must be so hard. Because you have no control over that, obviously.</br></br>Caller: Yeah. It's very scary. Because, you know, that's something, you know, especially, in these situations, where our medical care is not that good, to where they could end our life. You know? So that's the really scary part about it. You know? You've done all this time and you're trying to go home. And here you are. Next thing you know, COVID-19 had took effect on you, you know, by no fault of your own.</br></br>UCI: Yeah. It must be hard to not have the power to kind of Ð you can do what you can, but not much else.</br></br>Caller: Yeah. That is true. I mean we do [unintelligible] in here, as far as the inmates go. We're wearing our masks, you know, social distancing. You know? But, you know, that's all we can do, as far as that goes Ð try to keep things clean around here.</br></br>UCI: And what do you think they could do at your facility to improve how they're handling COVID?</br></br>Caller: I think, as far as getting our test results a lot sooner. That would help. You know? And then, I think the staff needs to practice what they preach, as far as social distancing and from theirselves. And then, also, wearing their mask. You know? Because they're the main ones who are, you know, who can affect us by it.</br></br>Caller: So I think those two things are very important, as far as Ð because, you know, they'll tell us social distancing. But, then, you'll look at them Ð they're in a big old huddle together. So I just think it would be better for them to practice what they preach, as far as that goes. Now, the tests, you know, I don't mind the testing, really, because, you know, it's for my own health. But it's just to get your results back a lot quicker would be, you know, a lot better. Because it's a lot of anxiety just waiting on the results. You know?</br></br>Because you don't know, as far as how the COVID gets in the air. You could catch that at any minute.</br></br>UCI: Yeah. That's very true.</br></br>Caller: Yeah.</br></br>UCI: And then, how has what's been going on inside Ð has it affected the people you know on the outside? Like any loved ones Ð have they been ...</br></br> Caller: Yeah.</br></br>UCI: ... worried?</br></br>Caller: Yeah. Because, you know, for one, the visiting has been shut down since like February. You know? So they've been Ð I mean I give the system some credit, though.</br></br>They've been trying to help us in ways like, you know, we have the phone calls that we make on the wall. And they're giving us free phone calls, certain days, throughout the month. You know? They've let us order Ð instead of two packages Ð I mean a package a quarter Ð they've raised it up where we can Ð even though, they're making a little money, too Ð it's where we can order more packages now, you know, to help, as far as getting food in your locker and stuff. They've Ð and just, you know, they've been giving us our masks and everything.</br></br>Where I work at, they're trying to get it to where they're giving us, pretty much, safer, better measures, as far as cleaning up everything and dealing with San Quentin's clothing. You know?
