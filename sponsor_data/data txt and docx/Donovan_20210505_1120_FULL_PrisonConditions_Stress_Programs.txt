Dear Redacted,</br></br>


Thank you for your letter and interest in my situation. COVID sucks. I sat in my dayroom about two and half months ago and watched my long time friend with a portable plug in fan pointed at his face, while he gasped for breath. The RNs, LVNs, and medical staff paid no mind. And all I could do was to offer petty antidotes; like: please…Get up and work that shit out’ve your lungs homeboy…</br></br>


He just kept on telling me - I can’t catch my breath…I can’t… And all I could do was yell at the nurses and get sent back into my cell. As I prayed for my friend I look into account he was in his 60’s and was a heavy addict of alcohol and heroin like myself.  Figured the “teenage crownsich” would get him.</br></br> 


When they finally took my friend to the hospital - I believe it was only a couple weeks before one of the guards told me he passed on. I cried, out loud. That is my main takeaway from this pandemic. Straight up hurt, coupled with seclusion, and an excuse for the COs to abuse their powers.</br></br>


Lockdowns on top of “training days” on top of excuse after excuse. We all got sick and some of us cried. But after it was all done, they still use it to fuck with our programs every day. I've been in prison like years and have seen the fun and the dangerous.</br></br>


Have done the S.H.U terms and model inmate fine campus. Currently I’m on Suboxone meds. in the substance treatment program and am a yard crew worker. Besides the meds I’m relatively sober and trying to stay focused on building a future beyond this place. I'm saving money and networking as much as possible so I can get a place to rest my head, a car, and a decent way to earn money.</br></br> 


This in a nutshell is my reality. Thanks for taking interest in this tragedy. If possible keep in touch so I can know you’re a real person. What kind of person are you?</br></br> 


 Can you send photos of yourself? Or any info on the project you guys are running? Thank you for being a voice for us voiceless. My love and respect. God bless you.</br></br>


Without way, 
A FIRE INSIDE.
