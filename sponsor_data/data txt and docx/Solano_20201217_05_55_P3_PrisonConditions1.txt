Caller: Yeah, they have us packed in a gym, like it’s like, well it’s like in here like sardines. When we were in the dorms, they had us like every other bunk they had inmates on, now it’s every bunk and they are all on, we're all on lower bunks but we have upper and lower but there’s no one on the top bunk. So, it’s all the bottom bunk, but we're just- it’s just so many men in here that it’s- they might as well reactivate the gym-</br></br>UCI: Right.</br></br>Caller: And this is illegal, they have an actual court order not to have these gyms housing inmates and they’re doing it anyway. And I’m looking across the yard right now because I’m on the facility C and I can see the dorm that I came out, so it’s like parallel to the gym door and there's nobody in that dorm! So, they're housing us in the gym, but there's a dorm open and available that has been sanitized, so they say.</br></br>I got the PSR, the daily activity status report and it says that they went in and sanitized that building and that dorm so they did that. I’m trying to understand why haven’t they started rehousing in back in to that dorm as opposed to leaving us in an illegal gymnasium that legally - something that a court order has been, there’s an injunction on housing inmates in the dorm and they’re doing it anyway!</br></br>UCI: Mhmm.</br></br>Caller: And they’re doing it anyway.
