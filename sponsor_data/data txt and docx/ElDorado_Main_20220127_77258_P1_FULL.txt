This story was told by a person incarcerated at El Dorado County Jail.</br></br>

UCI: And how has the COVID situation been like at your facility?</br></br>

Caller: Well, every person who I've met, who is sentenced, has caught COVID.</br></br>

UCI: Oh, wow.</br></br>

Caller: And I don't know if the local news have been alerted to this or not, but the numbers that are reporting are way below the — the population here. So, South Lake Tahoe facility is sort of like the overflow for the Placerville Jail. When inmates become sentenced, they're more often than not, moved to the — the Tahoe Jail.</br></br>

UCI: Mhm.</br></br>

Caller: So in El Dorado County, now, I don't know if this is — don't quote me on this, but the jail staff, they get time and a half pay. And they're not required to be vaccinated. And they come and go freely or, I mean, every day — every day they come and go, without having to quarantine, without having to, you know, be tested.</br></br> 

But inmates are required to be quarantined for two weeks, whether they're vaccinated or not. And what quarantine is — is that means we're locked in a cell 24 hours a day for two weeks.</br></br>

UCI: Mhm. Are you — are you locked with other people in the cell as well?</br></br>

Caller: Yes.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah?</br></br>

Caller: So — and here's — here's the irony, right? It's - so they're not required to — the staff is not required to get vaccinated. So, they're the carriers. They come and infect us, collect the time and a half pay, and then we're suffering from it.</br></br>

UCI: Mhm. Have you — have you personally caught COVID?</br></br>

Caller: So I was vaccinated.</br></br>

UCI: Mhm.</br></br>

Caller: About seven months ago, and I tested negative, but I did — I did get sick, but I did test not — negative.</br></br>

UCI: Mhm.</br></br>

Caller: But I — I tested negative three different times, but every — I — let me put it this way. I've not met another inmate that didn't catch it.</br></br>

UCI: Mhm.</br></br>

Caller: And supposedly, I mean, it's coming from the staff that aren't getting vaccinated. They're carry — they're carrying it here and they're infecting us.</br></br>

UCI: Mhm. And how is — how is the vaccination situation with other people in your facility besides the staff?</br></br>

Caller: Well, so, in here, the nurses, they — they acknowledge, “Oh, it's — it's pointless to get it.” So I got the vaccine thinking, “Hey, I wouldn't have to be — they could fast track me out of quarantine”; you know?</br></br>

UCI: Mhm.</br></br>

CAller: And they're, like, “Oh, well, you — it doesn't — the vaccine doesn't do anything anyways.” Well, what did I get it for? So — and there's sort of like this — this general distrust of the government.</br></br>

I've asked every, you know, guard, like, “Well, have you — have you gotten — have you got vaccinated?” They're, like, “No, we don't trust the government. We don't - we don't trust that.”</br></br> 

I'm, like, “Yeah, but if you're a public – if you're a public servant, then isn't it your sort of your duty to make sure that you're not infecting other people?” Of course, so, there's this general disregard for our safety. They're like, “Hey, we get — we get paid time and a half when there's an active outbreak. What's our incentive to go get vaccinated?”</br></br>

UCI: Is there — is there usually, like, an active outbreak? Like, has recently there just been like an — like an ongoing one?</br></br>

Caller: Yes.</br></br>

UCI: Mhm.</br></br>

Caller: Yes, they keep it — they keep it going because, so, in the quarantine housing unit, they keep bringing in new people, and — and they - it keeps infecting. People who don't have it, now all of a sudden they have it. And when the active out — when somebody was detected, they move them to a housing unit where the active outbreak, they just let it run its course.</br></br>

But, everybody in this facility has it. Everybody. At Placerville Jail, too.</br></br>

UCI: Mhm.</br></br>

Caller: And they keep it hush-hush. El Dorado County keeps it hush-hush. They don't want it to be known.</br></br> 

So that's why I'm calling you, letting you know that there — every — they're giving it to everybody in here. Everybody's got it.</br></br>

UCI: That's crazy. That you know, they're, like, trying to make it seem like it's not that big of a deal, but also just continuing the cycle of it by just letting, you know, all the staff just come in however they want without getting tested or anything.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah. And they're, like, they're — they're offended. They're like, I'm like, because they – they're – they – they try and push the whole thing with the mask on. They're like, “Oh, if we have to wear a mask, so do you.</br></br> 

I'm like, “Did you get vaccinated?” They're like, “No. Why – why would we get vaccinated?” I'm like, “Because you – because you – you're in contact with us. You're coming in here from the – from the streets, and we have to be locked down for 24 hours a day for two weeks.”</br></br> 

And Placerville is even worse. They – they – the whole facility is locked down. We - they – people don't even come out of their cell for – every two days they come out for 15 minutes to take a shower. And that in front of, like, 250 people.</br></br>

UCI: And, so, how has it been in your facility for, like, visitation and program? Is there none of it or is there some?</br></br>

Caller: Every — everything is shut down.</br></br>

UCI: Oh, wow.</br></br>

Caller: Everything's suspended. And you know what's weird about that? So, in Sac County, they still have programs running. And they have a higher risk.</br></br> 

They have — they have more of a — they have a more of a risk of a outbreak, but they still have recreation, they still have schooling, they still have everything. Here is nothing. They completely shut down.</br></br> 

There's no — there's no AA, there's no NA, there's no church, there's no visiting. There's nothing. They just shut everything down and they justify it with COVID.</br></br>

UCI: Right. But then even then, like, they're not doing anything to stop the COVID, so that's just annoying.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah. They’re — and they're not offering — I mean, you, yeah, you can get a vaccine, but the — even the nurses, oh, well, it's pointless. It's not gonna do anything.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, and that's just going to discourage more people from not doing it, yeah.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, so they – it – here's the thing is, like, they're – they don't – they don't put it out there, but they get – they get extra pay for the – for there being an active outbreak. So they don't have – there's no incentive for them to – to actually stop it.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, so getting paid more, yeah, it's – yeah.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah. And it gives them justification in locking everybody down, which makes their job easier because then now they don't have to, you know. Oh, everyone's just locked in their cells all the time. And they go, “Oh, it's because of COVID.”</br></br> 

So you could be at best behavior and you're – you're still gonna be given the same treatment as somebody who's, you know, getting in riots or doing whatever.</br></br>

UCI: Mhm. And, so, how have you been coping with the crisis? I know a lot of the times people can use programs kind of as an outlet, but since, like, that's not available, how have you been coping with it?</br></br> 

Cause it is difficult to just not be able to do as much. And, also, it's frustrating to know that nothing is being done about what is happening.</br></br>

Caller: Me, so, I mean, luckily — the only thing that we have going for us is they — they issue us tablets, which have lectures from universities and stuff like that. And, so, we're able to, you know, learn. Or at least we're able to, you know, to do that.</br></br>

And the tablets have radio on them and stuff like that. And, so, me personally, so I'm an artist and-</br></br>

UCI: Mhm.</br></br>

Caller: You know, I draw little cartoons that poke fun at what's going on here.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: Like—</br></br>

UCI: Like the ones you see in newspapers?</br></br>

Caller: Exactly, yeah. Actually, sent you guys one, and it's a cartoon of a — of a — of a jailer with a mask on and he says — this is an actual quote, too. He says, “If we have to wear em — if we have to wear masks, so do you.”</br></br> 

And the guy says, “Did get you vaccinated?” He says, “That's none of your concern, cop.” That was a real quote. So all my car — all my cartoons are poking fun — I poke fun at the staff and I try and do it, like, you know, in the most respectful way possible.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, but just a little bit satirical, yeah.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, well, that's cool that they — that they do give you access to tablets. I — because I've heard people talk about their tablets, but I didn't know if it was, like, everyone got one or if it was some people, but that's cool that they do give you the ability to have that as some sort of outlet, I guess.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah. Yeah. It — it is something. I mean, they have — they have lectures from Yale and all kinds of stuff. And you can acquire points and things like that. But—</br></br>

UCI: It's — it's — but it's also not the same; you know? Yeah, like, it's helpful, but also not the same as having, like, an in-person class or something.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah. And I feel like there's no oversight. I feel like the – the staff, especially in Placerville, is – so the – the – the high-ranking – like, so the brass, the – the sergeants and the lieutenants, they all sort of retired. 

And the only – the only people who were left there are sort of, like, these junior – junior deputies.</br></br>

UCI: Mhm.</br></br>

Caller: Who are just some of the most sadistic people that you will ever meet on the planet, and there's nobody to – to – there's no checks and balances. There's no oversight, at all.</br></br> 

And whenever – the suicide rate has gone up a lot since they started locking everybody down, as you would imagine; right? So the people, they're locked in their cell for four months at a time, right?</br></br>

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: So people are hanging themselves and things, but you'll never hear about it. They'll never release that.
