Dear PrisonPandemic project,</br></br>

Hello. I am a prisoner at Correctional Training Facility in Soledad, California. Your people were here and you toured the prison. I did not get to see any of your team, or I would have attempted to speak with one or more of you. </br></br>

I am a 70-year-old man. Being such, there are rules that apply to me for that, that CDCR must abide by. I would like to know what the law is and what they must do to keep me safe.</br></br>

I left all elderly prisoners should be made single-celled (one prisoner in each cell) and no dorm living at all. That would best keep us safe and away from others infected. But that is not the case here.</br></br>

Can you help me find out how to make these guards do the right things for safety prior to a problem, rather than fixing yet another mistake? I would be glad to keep you up on how they adjust and deal with things during this pandemic. Just let me know what to look for and what they should be doing.</br></br>

Looking forward to hearing from you.</br></br>

Sincerely.
