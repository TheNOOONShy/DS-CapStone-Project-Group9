Hello [redacted]</br></br>

2/28/21</br></br>

Thank you for your letter it means a lot. Well we getting only 2 hours out if we are lucky. A phone call once a week two calls are free a month. People get sick every other day with the COVID-19 because the C.O.s bring it in to us. CDCR doesn’t really care.</br></br>

First off I’m out to court from SATF Corcoran prison. When out to court for my two older kids got taking by CPS I got told I got nothing coming because I’m in prison. My mother was in the process of becoming a foster parent to my older 2 kids she was already raising my 5 year old when these COVID-19 took her life from my family on 7/23/20. 3 days before my son turned 10 years old on 7/[redacted]/20.</br></br>

I am it's hard to read my handwriting my hands are shaking really bad. I’m still going through the pain of losing my mother I was the baby in family one brother & one sister. And because of no visits and being away from Riverside County it was a year before she die no visits in my court or county jail and it was behind behind glass.</br></br>

County jail messed with inmates mind we were told we had no rights and only came out 30 mins out of 23 hours a day sometimes my cellmate me didn’t come out for 3 days we were being skipped. When asked to see mental health we were told no I have a high case of depression and I’m bipolar too. I even caught COVID-19 in 8-2020 in county jail where they housed people with COVID-19. Well I hope these help a little once anger thank you for caring. God Bless you all</br></br>
