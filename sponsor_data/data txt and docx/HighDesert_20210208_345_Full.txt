Dear Kristin,

Before anything, I hope all the students at UCI are in good health and COVID-free. Thank you for caring for all the inmates here in prison. Sometimes all we need is a letter from anyone to remind us that there is a real world out there, and luckily for me I will soon come home to in 2022.</br></br> 

Life here has been hard. Dealing with the stress and the worry about the guilt on not being able to take care of my kids, not knowing if they got their necessities, shelter, food, and clothing.</br></br>

I get angry because the state should be releasing people like me with bullshit drug convictions. The police department of the city of Gardena made a simple possession drug charge, which is a misdemeanor, into a felony bringing drugs into a jail only because they failed to find the drugs when they searched me in the streets. Because of the Gardena police department negligence and Torrance court system, I was sentenced to six years.</br></br> 

I had no choice but to take this deal because if I took it to trial and lost, I would of got punished to the maximum sentence, which was 12 years. I accept that I was wrong and broke the law by having drugs. What I needed was help with my addiction, like a drug problem, that was never offered. Not the six years I'm wasting in here.</br></br>

I see the news and read the paper only to be informed that this coronavirus is not getting better and people are dying in the thousands. That scared me for my family's sake. The last thing I'm trying to find out is that one of my family members died from this virus and me being stuck here in prison, not being able to get out and be there for my family. That would be something I would have to live with and maybe never get over.</br></br>

Living in prison during this pandemic has been difficult. The constant lockdowns. The constant COVID testing. As of right now, I haven't caught COVID. The no visits and not being able to physically hug and see my family makes it hard. But I know it's for everyone's good.</br></br> 

That California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitations has been trying to fight this crazy battle with the virus. But lockdowns with infected cellmates is obviously not the answer. I was negative the three and a half months I was in reception. Only to be moved from reception to another prison where the whole yard has been infected. The correctional officers housed me in the hot housing.</br></br> 

The block I was housed in was infected and moved me in with three different cellmates that has caught the virus. I really feel like the COs don't care if I'm healthy and COVID-free. One of the COs made a comment of "you're gonna catch it anyways, so who cares, get it over with."</br></br>

How can you say something like that? They're not treating this virus like it's real. This is life or death! I was sentenced to six years, not death.</br></br> 

I'm scared of this virus? Hell yes! I have a little girl that I'm trying to come back home to and raise. I'm forced to sit here till my release date. All I did was have drugs on me. I didn't ransack the capitol. They even got a pardon from the president.</br></br>

I'm just trying to come home safe and COVID-free to my family. I miss them and worry about them so much. It becomes hard for me doing time I shouldn't be doing. I'm going on 24 months for a possession. Hopefully something happens where drug charges get to go sooner because of the pandemic. Thank you for your letter. I appreciate your time and best wishes.</br></br>

Take care and stay healthy.
