This story was told by a person incarcerated at Mule Creek. </br></br>


Caller: I was bounced around 13 times from different housing, different housing and even the staff, you know, the custody staff, they didn’t know why. They would blame medical so um it was, it was just truly frustrating. </br></br>


And there was really no reason, which now looking back, the reason was you know I wasn’t, I hadn’t tested positive yet so they’re just, you know, bouncing me around from one place to another until ultimately I finally caught, you know, coronavirus. </br></br>


And that’s sad because now it just seems like they want everybody here to catch it so they can just get back to program. That seems to be what they, what the end result here is now instead of trying to contain it. They just want to spread it as quickly as they can.
