Theme: Infection: Infected with COVID and separation

Tent City</br></br>

Ten minutes ago, at 8:30 at night, I was in dorm city. Now after pushing a cart with my property in it, through the mud and cold, I have arrived at tent city. Tent city is comprised of 13 [8 man tents]. Twelve for sick inmates and one for staff. They look like FEMAS tents.</br></br>
Last night was the third night in the tent. The tents have heating and air conditioning but someone forgot to tell the company that supplied the tents and generators that preventative maintenance must be done to ensure such things as [fuses] are in working order. The temperature in the tent this morning was 41 degrees. As it was yesterday and the day before.</br></br>

So, I'm infected with COVID, brought in by staff. and now at 2:45 a.m. when I need to use the restroom, I get out from under every stitch of covers that I have, up off my cot, sick, and walk 50 yards to the "porta potties", in the 30-40 degree range, across the dewy wet grass to do my business. Then I head back to my frozen cot, and slip back into my wet sheets from my fever breaking.</br></br>
When the little herd of medical staff come back to do "vitals", we all line up [sick], outside in the weather. We could go in the 13th tent that the cops use, but the cops don't want us filthy vermin in there. Plus, it's cold outside and their heater damn sure works, so they don't want to come out in the cold. It's cold enough that the medical staff giggle and sheepishly ask us to stick our fingers in our pockets so that they are warm enough to provide correct readings on the equipment.</br></br>
Here's a real hoot for you, at least to the medical staff. I'm a fat white, balding, 37-year-old, but my blood pressure is normal. On one of the vital checks the machine said my blood pressure was like 187/95. I said I don't think the is right. The RN just chuckled and said “yah, half the time this junk equipment doesn't work right".</br></br>

That's funny.....right???? I'm just a stupid inmate, that according to the CDCR gets the best medical care, (even better than people on the streets) . . . .oh and I "should have thought of that before coming to prison" right?</br></br>

Well after 15 days in the tent city, I have been, thankfully, cleared to move back to a cell. Of course, not the cell I had and not with my old cellmate. So, from beginning to end, I started in my cell, got infected by staff, went to dorm city, then tent city, and now back to a cell. Not one thing is different. No new precautions. No increase in disinfecting areas. No change in staff behavior toward protocols. What was the point in all that movement?</br></br>
