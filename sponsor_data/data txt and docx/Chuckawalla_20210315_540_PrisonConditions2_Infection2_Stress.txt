I had to get two surgeries for that damage and still my eye on my left and my right don’t work like it should. I also have issues with my noses, and the skin-graft is OK, but my looks well it’s hard to look in a mirror. So UC Hospital Cancer Center, doctors tell me after your surgery and you recover, which will take sometime you will be receiving radiation treatments for seven weeks. 30 or 40 every day treatment.</br></br> 

So now they prepared me with more test to see if I’m able to do this surgery all of them in one day.</br></br> 

I’m 64 years old and this surgery was 12 and a half hours long. This was a risk surgery for my age. Now to end my story, my surgery was a successful series of achievements for me to overcome. But now come recover and then radiation.</br></br>

14 days to recover in the hospital that was hard being hand-cuffed to the bed and leg also cuff to the bed, one hand and one leg each.</br></br> 

So 14 days to recover, then I was move to a prison medical confinement (captive) housing on a medical-hold. Until after my radiation treatments. That did not happen for another two months, got my treatments. But I was at this new prison for four months before I could get my medical-hold lifted for I can go back to my home-prison and to return to normal program.</br></br>

Now I’m off my medical-hold and my home-prison pick me up and take me to the home-prison and I find out that I got to do 14 days in quarantine (isolation) in the cell that use be call (the hold). My 14 days are up WOW. Some journey five months after surgery and radiation, treatments, medical-hold, quarantine in the hold.</br></br>

All and all my medical journey took one years and two months. That my COVID-19 story.</br></br> 

You are welcome to edit my story as you can see that my writing are a little off. I try to write this story has it was. There was a lot more to this journey I was on for sometime.</br></br> 

Please write me back if you use my story. I would like it to be told to you reader.</br></br> 

In January I got my first vaccination-shot and then my second shot in February I’m good to go.</br></br>

Coping with the pandemic and my medical need with skin-cancer and all that had happen in the last 14 was very hard for me. I did had to see a mental health professional to keep from losing it. Once again thank you.
