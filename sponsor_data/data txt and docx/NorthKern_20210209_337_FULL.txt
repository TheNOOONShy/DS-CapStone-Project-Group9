I’m quite surprised by receiving your letter/message, especially surprised with your concern with our well-being in this place.</br></br>
 
I’ve been incarcerated since 2016. My first piece of mail, which I’ll likely keep even when I parole. If you ask why? Well I’m kind of intrigued when a group of people (PPP) wanting to get real stories from the men and women that are isolated, especially at these times with this pandemic.</br></br>

And to archive what is real for historical purposes. I’m all in for change! I hope with the letter I’ll tell, it will enlighten you even more.</br></br>
 
Just with a couple people that I’ve talked to about “prison pandemic,” they showed interest in sharing. One of these guys has a lot to share. He has your number and P.O. Box so expect something shortly.</br></br>
 
I’m 54, a seventh termer for all the state of California and I’m not proud that I’ve spent most of my life away from family when I first started doing time in the early ‘80s. Our healthcare has not like it is today. Our healthcare is way better and not as stressful. ‘80s and ‘90s if I had a toothache, extractions was all they did. And sometimes it would take a year just for that!</br></br>

These days, quick x-rays to determine if they can save it; if not, then they yank it. All in a timely manner.</br></br>
 
COVID-19 hits the news in December 2019. But they were saying it's likely SARS, like what happened in 2003. January 2020 I think Wuhan goes on lockdown.</br></br>

China denies it's COVID and not transmissible between human to human. WHO knows about this outbreak, denies a pandemic until they get more data. People like me, in the early days of this pandemic is already thinking biological warfare, manmade and even population control.</br></br>

When a city goes on lockdown and this prison goes on modified program, then shit is happening. Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation slowly kept on modifying our program as needed based on information received. One day people would say, “we’re okay.” The next day CDCR is passing out newly manmade masks. This, now indicating something very serious is happening.</br></br> 
 
December 13, 2019, I was doing my regular routine at work here in North Kern State Prison, P.M. culinary cook for A-facility dining hall. Doing my duties as a cook, our supervisor makes an announcement for all guys living in building 1 to go back to their unit. Building 1 is now quarantined.</br></br> 

At this time, the rest of the facility general population is talking, gossiping. Rumors indicate everyone in that building has COVID-19. A regular floor officer tested positive, coming in contact with everyone. So quarantine the whole building, and even all PIA workers came into contact with someone, so lock them down!</br></br>
 
I wish there has more communication between prison administration to us in general population!</br></br>
 
The severity of this pandemic could cause great harm for someone that is concerned about it. If they have chronic care issues themselves or if they’re worried about loved ones out there in the free world.</br></br>
 
This pandemic has and is still a big concern for myself. 2010, while at another prison on my last term, I had MSRA pneumonia. One day I woke up with shortness of breath. I went man down, subsequently hospitalized at Mercy Hospital in Basic Fields California.</br></br>

All I remember was getting in an ambulance at Wasco State Prison, making it to the ER then everything went black. Reading old medical receipt brought me up to what happened but one thing I remembered was waking up to my daughter’s voice and someone saying, “Oh shit, he’s alive!” This incident became one of my worries if I had caught COVID-19.</br></br>

Respiratory problems then and this virus attacking our respiratory system now. Now, I don’t have to die in prison!</br></br>
 
Taking the precautions in this pandemic has, as information or data received the way I see it was, “live and learn.” But why not, scientists knows the complexity, or this virus so mandate a procedure or guidelines ahead of time, to save lives! I believe we that are incarcerated should be informed in a timely manner of updates, procedures, and plans, not after the fact.</br></br>
 
This past year has been hard for me. I was scared of catching this virus and the same fright for anyone I know or family. You can see it in some of these guys that they were feeling the same. Oh my god! When CDCR cancelled all visits. Some guys took it hard. Especially when they know their family or loved one had medical conditions.</br></br>
 
This past year was physically stressful. There’s five(s) housing units here. At one time, for a couple of months, two other units, building 3 and 5 along with 1 has to quarantine. Only 2 and 4 had little movement.</br></br>

Like yard and get to walk to a dining hall for our meals. I, fortunately, has not quarantined. And since all the other guys I work with has quarantined, I had to work seven days. Multi-tasking at work just to feed this facility.</br></br>

Building 1, 3, and 5, since they were quarantined, had to be cell fed. After making those trays, push those carts to their unit then go back to serve for building 2 and 4. When all done I had to go get the carts at the buildings.</br></br>

Wash those trays and the trays from the ones that walked to chow and all the pot and pans used and the whole culinary. Do you know how hard and stressful it is to do this since the pandemic started? A few times only myself and another guy would be the only workers.</br></br>

Many times, I wanted not to go to work. But I had to. I didn’t want to get a disciplinary for not showing because I go to board or prison hearing in September 2021 and getting a disciplinary could set me back another year for review.</br></br>
 
This pandemic and the flu season was and still is, a double-edged sword. This one guy when he came out of his cell for vitals, fell face first to the floor, then put him back into his cell. When guys come into contact with staff that tested positive for COVID or tested positive for COVID, they were sent to facility B or D for quarantine.</br></br>

After two weeks and a negative test, they would come back to facility A, sometimes a guy would be rehoused in building 2 or 4, the now effected buildings, doesn’t that put others at risk of infection?</br></br>
 
It’s 3 a.m. I got your letter last night when I got off work. I appreciate your concern with us in here.</br></br>

I want to continue this letter but I’m tired, really tired! Sorry for any misspelling words and/or bad sentence structure.</br></br>
 
I promise I will be back!</br></br>
 
Thank you.
