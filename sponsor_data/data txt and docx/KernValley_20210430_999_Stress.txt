This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Kern Valley.</br></br>Panic and fear of COVID-19. As testing for COVID-19 proceeds forward, as the virus is detected in more black and brown communities of color. These communities will be held hostage under siege in a state of quarantine.</br></br>As the outcry ramps up, the underlying feelings of resentment rises to the surface as hatred shows its true face. Because black and brown communities are presumed to be preventing the masses from moving on with their day to day lives.</br></br>No more being kind to our neighbors, no more love or help for our fellow man. The chants and cries will become surrounded and barricade these black and brown communities the day they did in Wuhan. So the disease doesn’t spread to those on this side.</br></br>Those who stockpiled all those weapons, and those who ran out and made all those impulsive buys of guns, ammunition, bullet proof vest, gas mask, and other supplies will amass in numbers. Threatening black and brown communities not to venture outside their areas for fear of COVID-19 spreading to their side.</br></br>Panic has set in, logic is no longer an option. Old stereotypes and lies from the past are now the topic and talk to fuel hidden thoughts and feelings about black and brown people. Relegating them to none important.</br></br>Is this really America? Home of the brave, land of the free. When some people become hostile and indifferent towards black and brown communities.</br></br> 

Due to pre-existing conditions, poverty, systematic racism, and all the issues that are rampant among these communities that makes them slightly susceptible to COVID-19.
