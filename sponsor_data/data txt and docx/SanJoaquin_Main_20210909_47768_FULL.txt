This story was told by a person incarcerated at San Joaquin County Jail.</br></br>

Caller: Hi, there. Cool, cool, yeah. I had a few things I wanted to talk about tonight. One of them first being that – that I guess I made a mistake of giving a shoutout to Krsitin Turney the – yesterday, I believe, about what I thought was a friend of hers [unintelligible] kitchen worker in my – that – that was actually the kitchen worker in my story of – that I named today, but he made it sound that way. But then I talked to him a little bit more today and realized that maybe – maybe not so much a friend. Maybe more of a punk. But, so, yeah, I just wanted to verify that I – I [had no intent mistaking] what I said.</br></br>

But I – and then I – I understand if you want to know more about being able to give you more information about what we're going through here in jail with this – this prison pandemic thing. Well, first of all, everybody keeps telling me to remind me to tell you about how originally there was 60 of us in here. We've been here for about a month already [unintelligible] with just the group we had, there was no COVID present. We were all good. And then all of a sudden out of nowhere, they started double bunking us, which these rooms are only equipped for one – one bed. It's got one bed.</br></br>

It's equipped – it's a cell for one. But out of nowhere they started double bunking us and they'd move – over night they moved 16 new guys in here. They – they'd have a guy sleeping on the floor next to a guy, and then they did that just – just for that night, and then through – halfway through the next day they'd – they'd come in and grab those same 16 guys and move them back out of here. They – and then three days later, they did it again. They did this twice in a row for reasons unbeknownst to anybody.</br></br>

And with that, like, a few days later they're, like, they start this immediate COVID, like, panic talking about all these other pods have COVID and we're going to have to test you all – all you guys for COVID and people suddenly started getting sick. And then, like, 20 of us tested positive for COVID and they just locked us down 30 days from there. It was a little strange. And then – and now I've been through this three times since I've been here over the past, like, two years almost, and three different occasions where we've gone through this prison lockdown. This is their lockdown to where they closed down the courts to us and they won't let us go to court because of the fact that they want to make sure none of us have COVID and we don't want to – they don't want to send us the judge's way with COVID, carrying all that stuff and getting everybody sick over there. So that – that's the usual. We're used to that. That makes sense.</br></br>

But now they – they – we – everybody here has passed a negative on the test three times in a row, so that they can – they opened up the floor. We're no longer on lockdown after, like, yesterday. And, so, and with that, I have court tomorrow, and all's I got to do is get to this dang courtroom and talk to the judge and I'm likely to walk right out of here either with time served or get my bail reinstated. One way or another, I'm walking out of here and – and I've – I've ready [unintelligible] out a court date last Tuesday that I missed because we were still on lockdown. Now they've released this – they've taken back the – the lockdown as of yesterday, so my court date tomorrow, I should get out of here. They're informing us that they're not allowing us to go to court still because now that they've cured us and they've rid the whole pod of COVID, they don't want to let us out in the world because there's COVID out there and they – they don't want to get us sick.</br></br>

So there's several people in here that are past their time served and should just be out. You know, their sentence is done. They just got to, you know, be released essentially, and they're refusing to release them because there's COVID – the [ward] full of COVID. And I don't know what – where they get this – this power of attorney over us, this right over our lives, but, yeah, those – they're taking such good care of us they're just going to keep us locked up for the rest of our lives, I guess, and I don't know where it's going with all this, but I'm – it's quite frustrating. So just they mutter, like, oh, that could change at any time. So I keep my fingers crossed hoping that I'll wake up tomorrow. My court's supposed to be – I should – should have court at 8:30 in the morning. I'm hoping I'll just wake up tomorrow and they'll go handcuff me and put me on a bus, send me on my way. Otherwise, if I miss tomorrow's court date, they'll immediately take it back ten more days.</br></br>

So whether they – whether or not they open courts up to us Monday or whatever it's going to be, I'm going to be – I'm just going to do ten days extra just because, and it's frustrating. It's really frustrating. I don't like any of it. It's, like, I don't know where they get off, but it – it – telling me. But, so, yeah, with that being said, overnight last night I did manage to muster up another story. I'm thrilled I put it down on paper.</br></br>

It's something that needs to be said, and I said it, and I'm very happy that I did so. And as promised, yesterday I mentioned I would – I would write a story that included a – my – my friendship with Robin Williams, and – and I've got that in here, although that's not at all what the story's about, but, yeah, like he ties into it clearly and particularly. So I managed to get a – what, there's just 11 pages here. Wrote it for you last night and a little bit this morning. So I'll go ahead and read that to you now.</br></br>

I call it Miracle and it goes like this. And this is the most personal story I've written and it's very true to heart – my heart and hopefully I do just make – make it through without must completely breaking down on you guys. I'll do my best. Miracle.</br></br>

UCI: You've got this. You've got this. If you need a few seconds to breathe at all, please go ahead and do it.</br></br>

Caller:	Cool. I will do so. I appreciate it. Thank you. All right. And this is my first read-through. I just finished it in the minutes before the call where I worked at it a little bit and am calling it. Okay. As I have told you before, I have suffered in many, many ways. Indeed, too many ways to count with some of them being too severe to properly describe in ways that you might be able to understand what I went through.</br></br>

I lost my best friend at the age of 13 at the Clubhouse we lived in, and the little girl that also stayed there with us had to have her arms and legs chopped off in order to save her life due to an infection from meningitis, which is a contagious disease you don't want to mess with. And the people in charge at the house waited too long to call – to care – waited too long to care how sick the kids were getting. I survived it and the little girl would later on go [unintelligible] some talk shows like Ricki Lake and others to talk about what she endured, but that's perhaps a story for another time.</br></br>

At this time – at this time around, I wish to tell you about what it was like for me and what my children and I went through together with back-to-back-to-back tragedies. It started with my firstborn son. And, so, we were so excited to bring him – I don't know – I should have read this through first. It started with my firstborn son as we were so excited to bring him into the world begin this new life as parents and as a family. Having a child has to be the best feeling you could ever know. I would probably have 10 children if I could.</br></br>

I've always joked that I'll have as many kids as I could afford the medical insurance for because that shit gets expensive. But with as much fun as we were having buying and collecting all the stuff to build this nursery for our new son and then finally bringing him home to see his new world, about a week and a half in we noticed something has – was wrong. My poor little baby had stopped eating. And the next day early in the morning I noticed his stomach was rock hard. I mean solid – solid like a board.</br></br>

So we quickly rushed him down to the emergency room and showed the doctors what was going on. They immediately grabbed him from us and ran with him into one of the rooms they had available where at first it was one doctor in there with him, and then very quickly there was two, and then three, then four. Within a few minutes it seemed like the whole staff had made their – made a mad dash over to his room. As one of the doctors then came out and sat us down, while one of the hospital administrators also joined us.</br></br>

They were preparing us for the worst as they explained to us that he had contracted a disease, a disease called encephalitis, a close cousin of the disease I had mentioned earlier called meningitis, and that in his condition and at this age ,that it was highly unlikely that he would be able to survive this as the disease is very aggressive and fierce, that it attacks the brain rapidly, quickly causing organs to shut down and then death. I went numb and began – okay. There it is. I went numb and began to tune everything out as I couldn't believe what I was hearing.</br></br>

On that day, I think it must have been God or Muhammed, maybe Jesus or Allah, but all of them came together and joined their hands to see our little baby make it through the night as I believe he had about five percent chance of survival. My little man held on just like his daddy did. He's a survivor. With the first few weeks being the toughest, we were told every day that this could be his last. As the weeks turned into months, it felt like we now lived at this hospital. And as we surpassed – as we surpassed every milestone, they would say things like, okay, looks like he's going to survive, but he will most certainly be retarded from what – what the disease has done to his brain. Then as he would pull through a little more, they would say, okay, he probably won't be retarded, but he'll for sure he'll have a definite learning disorder of sorts.</br></br>

After a while it started to feel like he had completely pulled through, but the doctors were bent on the most negative possible outcome to where finally towards the end, it seemed like it would get to the point where they would come out of the NICU room – facility – the NICU facility and hand us our baby saying something along the lines of, okay, fine, he's not going to be retarded, he's not going to have a learning disorder, but he's not going to be a likable little kid, so, here, take your little brat and get out of here. Or at least that was a fun little joke that I had made up for us at the time to get everybody up. It was six months before they released us to go home. And home was the place to be for the next six months with our brand-new house in this development in Livermore right next to the Laboratory where my mom was now working. It was the start of a new life and days were filled with joy. It felt like the sun was always shining.</br></br>

UCI: Hey, take your time. You're doing great.</br></br>

Caller: Then it became quite – oh, I'm good. Thank you. I just got to slow down here a minute. Then it became time once again to bring joy into this world as my first daughter was now about to arrive. We spent a little over two days at the hospital during and after her birth as my little baby girl was born during the eclipse of the moon, and due to the fact that when my daughter was born, she came out with the cord wrapped around her neck and had been a fairly long labor, so she was solid dark purple. It looked bizarre as I cringed for the entire time that it took for them to revive her and eventually take her first breath. And for a moment I just about lost it all over again, but they quickly told us this is fairly common and that she would be fine. So again, peace and – peace had been restored to my – my universe, and all was well as another – as another year would pass swiftly.</br></br>

I went and bought an even bigger house that was also brand new just across the way from where we were staying. Everything seemed perfect in the world which then gave me the strength while creating the need for me to really push with my career as I had more mouths to feed with another one on the way and this house of ours was costing $800,000 and having a payment of $5,000 per month. In a way, my wife and I began really two separate lives at this time with me at work so often all day every day.</br></br>

I'd just barely get a few hours a day with my babies as well as getting to sleep with them and cuddle them at night, which is something I cherished coming home to where my wife would eventually say that our California King-size bed was too small for us all, which was bull, and she would sleep in one of the other rooms in one of the kids' beds while I would cuddle my two little nuggets all night. I only took maybe five days or so off per year during this – these times when they were so small, and I was never able to be sure to what my wife was up to all day as I begged her daily to stop smoking cigarettes and was certain she was occasionally drinking alcohol.</br></br>

But seeing the way things turned out eventually, I'm thinking she probably snuck in some occasional drug use as well because our grace period in between kids was cut short by two and a half months when the second daughter of mine came out early at only six and a half months gestation period or pregnancy. This poor little thing was barely three pounds and was so, so tiny. But much worse than that, as they informed us as they began to transport for us to go to the medical center immediately was that the two main ventricles attaching to either side of her heart were somehow on backwards, and for her to survive, they would have to perform open heart surgery to switch them around or else she would [for surely die of pain].</br></br>

When we arrived at the hospital over in San Francisco where they had the best doctors for this sort of procedure, and as the surgery was now a big deal, perhaps one of the – one for the record books even – we were informed that she would now live there for a good long time – a good long while. They needed her to grow first. She needed to put on at least one pound before they would feel comfortable performing the surgery. So we kept her in an induced coma for the next six months when she – for the next six months or more while she slowly grew big enough for them to feel like it was time to attempt this with no guarantee for success either way.</br></br>

It was during this time that the actor and comedian Robin Williams was also preparing himself for his own necessary heart procedure, and he lived very close to the hospital in a city called Marin only 20 minutes away. And with ours and the hospital permission, he then – and with the hospital's and our permission, he then took it upon himself in preparation for his own surgery to monitor my baby during the stages of success with my daughter's surgery. In a sense, he was building up confidence to take the leap of enduring open-heart surgery based on the success and strength of my young daughter going through it first.</br></br>

And almost – and almost just like his character in the movie Patch Adams, he would show up regularly to cheer everybody up. I even have a picture of him on Christmas standing over her little incubator giving her a teddy bear for Christmas. And I'll cherish it forever as he is such a great man with such a good heart and so much soul. It was a privilege to know that man and so heartwarming to see him on the David Letterman show talking about all of it and how he has now joined the zipper chest club as he called it.</br></br>

Her surgery – her surgery was a success and a miracle that you can call. We spent a year and a half of our lives at that hospital, and it cost us over $1.2 million after the insurance cap. We gave up on buying that house and foreclosed it. It was – it was during 2008 anyways when the entire economy collapsed, so we moved out to [redacted] where we got a much bigger house for less than half of the cost as a rental – being – being as a rental. The two things that will always stay with me from the experience – from that experience is just how amazing my daughter is and what it looked like seeing that strong little heart of hers beating outside her little baby chest as they pulled us into the surgery room to show us that it was a success before closing her back up.</br></br>

And on a happy note, my next one that I had a few years late – after that was born as a bubble baby, which means the water never broke and he came out – he came out of the womb still inside the embryo sac completely intact. It was amazing. It looked like in the movie Matrix where they were growing babies in the little embryo pods still in the fetal position. One of the nurses there was Navajo Native American, and she told us that this was a very rare – this was very rare and only one in 80,000 babies are born like this, and that for her people, this means he will grow up to be a great leader someday. And he is my exact clone, this baby. I love him to death. He's my perfect little mini me. And I can tell you that in writing this story, being able to sit and remember and reflect on just how lucky I am having these four wonderful children and in – and in good health as they are.</br></br>

There is nothing in this world more important to me right now than hopefully being allowed to go to court tomorrow so that they can release me immediately so I can race back to my children as fast as possible and give them the biggest hug ever because I know my babies – I know my babies well and I know they need that so badly. To feel – to feel that loving embrace that comes from such an eternal place within so that I can then begin to rebuild the foundation of the life they've always known.</br></br>

As I immediately establish a new place of residence and get right back to being the best father they can ever have. While taking all the necessary precautions to see to it that none of this ever happens again and that I stay vigilant making certain that I'll do whatever it takes to avoid imprisonment at all costs because I can blame this or that for – for me going to jail and say it's not fair and this is why, but I have to accept the fact that this is my fault. I let this happen one – one way or another. It could have easily all been avoided.</br></br>

And I know this last part is sort of wrote separately, but I think it will have the most impact on the world around me if it's heard by the right people. One final thing I think I'd really like to speak on attached to this whole topic of the miracle of having produced this wonderful family of mine is very quickly on the topic of abortion. I might be able to say a few things attached to my experience with abortion that could save some of – save some of you the troubles of dealing with what I have to deal with now.</br></br>

Abortion can serve its proper purpose in avoiding dealing with what would have been some serious birth defects as well as other possible serious things such as rape and whatnot, but as far as being a person that is intent on having a family of their own some day and getting an abortion prior to be ready to create this family, I would tell you that those actions should be avoided if at all possible.</br></br>

Though it may interfere with what plans you might have, you might – you may have had for your life or perhaps you think you can't afford it, whatever it may be, as I waited until I was 26 years old to have my first child always telling myself I wasn't ready and having had a couple abortions myself along the way, I will tell you that once you do have your first child, you may then realize that you were ready the whole time. And once you experience the true wonder and joy of having a child, you'll see that you could have easily handled all this and you definitely would have enjoyed it. And as the years roll on, your family begins to grow and thrive – I'm sorry. And as the years roll on and your family beings to grow and thrive, you'll one day come to the realization of just what you've done whereas for me, I often feel that void in my life – whereas for me, I often feel that void in my life from the absent – absence of what should be my two oldest kids.</br></br>

And sometimes when I'm in deep thought, it's as if I could almost hear their – oh fuck – it's as if I can almost their voices calling out to me asking me why, why did I not allow them this wonderful experience of life. And I have no way to answer them because I will never have an excuse good enough to have taken their lives from them. It's the – it's the single worst thing I could have ever done in this life of mine, killing my own children, and I will forever carry with me the guilt of having done so. It's not something I'll ever be able to change or take back and sometimes causing me to cry randomly because I love my children so much. Especially with the unfairness of me having been an unwanted pregnancy that accidentally happened by [unintelligible] of an ex-girlfriend of my father's that even with my aunt demanding that my mother have an abortion, my mother refused creating a rift in the family dynamic to where I only even became relevant after my father's death.</br></br>

But even then, I still remained neglected which is part of the reason why it does bring me great pleasure to have grown into the alpha male of the family having derived from the [the best of them in my] – being my father. So please, just know how precious all life is and can be as we are all our own working miracles in progress. So whether or not you just want to – huh, you just want to – so whether or not you just wanted that extra year or two for yourself at your own time or whatever it may be, do consider sparing yourself a lifetime of regret and have that baby now and get to the joy of what it's like to be a parent and having now created a bond and a love that will be stronger than anything you've ever known. Thank you.</br></br>

UCI: No, thank you. No, it takes a lot of courage to share something so personal, and you did amazing again. And it was another beautiful story.</br></br>

Caller: Oh, thank you. Yeah, that was a hard one.</br></br>

UCI: I know. You were very brave, and I really appreciate it. We all really appreciate how personal the stories are.</br></br>

Caller:	Well, and I really appreciate what you guys are doing. It's amazing and it's meant a lot to me. I sit here with this – this book back on my counter, my desk here, and it would have never existed otherwise, and it just makes me feel so proud. I've actually even got a – a hard – a hard cover – made into a hard cover by using two pieces of cardboard that were already pre-exiting. It's 11 by – 8 by 11 size because they're the backing for the types of paper I was working with, so I have a front and back cover. And this thing is 80 pages plus, you know, big, long, and it's a big thick book. I'm calling it the Eternal Flame Within, The Life and Legacy of a Man Fully Written from Behind Bars.</br></br>

And, yeah, I'm – I just – I'm really proud of it, and it never would have existed if it wasn't for what you guys are doing with your program. It would have just most likely ended up amounting to no more than a few stories just stored away in a drawer getting moved around from time to time never being read by anybody. But having these stories just makes me feel wonderful knowing that, you know, 10, 20, 30 years from now I will always be able to read back and see exactly what transpired in my life, and remember it correctly, and see how – what I was feeling and what I was going through instead of – it's a really good thing, and I do enjoy it, so thank you.</br></br>

UCI: And thank you so much. It's – it's because of people like you that call us and share with us that keeps this program so amazing.</br></br>

Caller:	Yeah, yeah, I can't wait to look it up online when I get out of here and I see what you guys are working with there.</br></br>

UCI: Of course. Yes. And again, it was – it's very – this one was very touching. It was a very beautiful and well-written story, well though-out. It was perfect.</br></br>

Caller:	Well, thank you. I'm glad you enjoyed it. And I hope it helps somebody along the way.</br></br>

UCI: It definitely will.</br></br>

Caller:	All right. Well, this phone is about to hang up in a second, so I will hopefully talk to you again. And if not, thank you so much.</br></br>

UCI: Of course. And I am very glad that you tested negative. That's great.</br></br>

Caller:	Oh, no, I have plenty – I [unintelligible]. It's everybody else that hasn't tested negative. Once they test you once, they don't test you – once you test positive, they don't test you again.
