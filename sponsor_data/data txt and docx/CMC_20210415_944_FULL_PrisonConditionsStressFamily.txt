Hey PrisonPandemic Project,</br></br>

I received the card, and I also thank you for having an interest in the health an mental status of other’s. Some people, even some family member’s, would turn their back on you once you’ve been threw this.</br></br>

Prison, a place made to send the worst and untamable, those. But prison also holds those whom have been wrongly convicted. Sometimes they’ll stand out right off, other’s with trouble proving their innocence seem to have the hardest time, then their hope to make it threw get’s answered, by people like you! I much appreciate your concern. Now if we could address another topic, the food here in C.M.C. State Prison, is horrible! The food is not even eatable, no protein, no proper fruit.</br></br>

Always dry and cold, sometimes the same meal everyday. Although the menu never changes, and complaints fall on deaf ear’s. 

Well, how can we get them to understand were human too, and everyone here didn’t deserve to be.</br></br>

Keep in touch.
