This letter was written by a person incarcerated at San Quentin.</br></br>

Dear PrisonPandemic Project, UC Irvine Student,</br></br>
 
What a surprise to receive a letter from someone new and want to take the time to hear my thoughts. I hope that you are doing well in the state of the world today.</br></br>
 
I will try and answer your questions relating to: What has it been like for me in San Quentin State Prison in the midst of COVID-19; Do I feel safe while here; How do I feel about reduced visitation from family or loved ones; and how am I coping with this crisis?</br></br>
 
These are tough questions. I probably can go on and on but I will keep my responses short (SMILE)!</br></br>
 
Well, being incarcerated at San Quentin State Prison during this pandemic has been very unsuspecting and scary. Yes, us tough guys get afraid of things too because we are still human beings. During this pandemic, we are aware that we may not survive. To date, 28 prisoners have succumbed to COVID-19.</br></br> 

It is impossible to adhere to any of the protective measures recommended by the Center of Disease Control (CDC) or the orders issued by the Warden’s office and the prison Medical Department at San Quentin who instructed us to social distance while placed in a two-man cell so small only one person can actually move at a time. I was told to wash my hands with sanitizer when there is none.</br></br> 

There is no possible way to social distance living in an extremely crowded, overburdened, dimly lit, un-ventilated, and outdated 170-year-old overly retro-fitted facility.</br></br>
 
I am a level two prisoner, low risk to re-offend who has served 32 years of continued incarceration on a life sentence for a non-homicide conviction as a youth offender appearing before the Board of Parole only once ending in a three-year stipulation induced by my prison appointed counsel. Now I am here suffering COVID-19, WOW! I did not see this coming.</br></br> 

I am not alone in this situation here at San Quentin. There are many young and elderly prisoners here with numerous underlying health conditions who have served just as much and more time as I have. Even the Court of Appeals Ordered Prison Authorities to lower the population to 50% for San Quentin’s Population to have a chance of any possible recovery from this COVID-19 outbreak that was caused by continuing to crown an already overcrowded prison.</br></br> 

And transferring people from Chino State Prison for Men where an outbreak had already occurred and placing them here at San Quentin. This move by CDCR led to the death of one corrections sergeant and 28 prisoners and counting here at San Quentin, but CDCR seems to do business as usual.</br></br>
 
This leads me to a fun fact, well not really a fun fact but true. Did you know that San Quentin is the first state prison built on land in California in the early 1800s? This could be one reason why California chooses to incarcerate it’s own people for extensive and indeterminate periods of time.</br></br> 

California’s first love was and still is to incarcerate. Now known as the Prison Industrial Complex System, paid for by the taxpayers. There has to be another way besides locking a man or women in a cage forever, believe me, people do change.</br></br>
 
The second thought is: How I feel about my safety. I am scared to maybe death; my family and community are just as afraid because death could result with me and others here if we continue living here in San Quentin in these conditions. This virus is going no where soon.</br></br>

There is a great possibility that the prisoner’s will die if the government doesn’t take this outbreak seriously, because we’re not on the moon, we are still part of this world and our communities.</br></br>
 
The next thought is: What has it been like to have reduced visitations from family and friends. Well, this one is easy. San Quentin has completely stopped all visitation from family and friends since the pandemic began. So, no, no prisoners have visited any family members or friends.</br></br> 

The only people I see around here are corrections staff, some with masks and some without masks, nurses in hazmat suits, and those here serving of security because all other preventative measures are not possible in this and other prison facilities. The parole board holds hearings through video feed or phone calls, even attorneys. No one comes into the prison to visit.</br></br>

It is sad because it affects everyone mentally and emotionally. A 15-minute collect call doesn’t do it for me and the hardship that comes with using the twelve phones in a unit that houses over 800 plus people.</br></br>
 
The last thought is: How have I been coping with this crisis? This one is hard, because I really don’t know. All I have been doing is sleeping more, receiving out of cell time for about one hour and thirty minutes every other day for yard, a collect phone call and a shower that only has twelve shower heads along with about 200 other men here at the same time. This in itself should be illegal.</br></br>
 
I read and study about some things and write. I have been trying to prepare myself for my next board hearing one day in parole suitability. I pray and I do have hope for a better day, I hope to be in a better place, I hope to be with my family and loved ones, I hope to be free in every sense of the word, but all I can do is hope.</br></br> 

All I can do is try and have positive thoughts about my situation. It is hard talking to my family over the collect call phone system here and then just walking away to who knows where in this prison. I guess what keeps me going is the faith in God that I have even though this system has no feelings.</br></br> 

Just imagine, we as a people created this system and it will take us a people to fix it. I don’t think anything is wrong with jails, institutions or prisons, the problem is how we use them.</br></br>
 
I have enclosed some other writings that I have, and I hope that you can use them in some way.</br></br>
 
Thank you for writing to me allowing me to participate in this program. Take care, stay safe and God bless you.</br></br>
 
Sincerely,</br></br>

[redacted]</br></br>
 
If you have any other questions or need me to write anything else, please feel free to ask and I will do my best. I may try to call but with 15-minutes every other day, it’s not so easy. Some of the writings were written by me earlier during this COVID-19 outbreak at San Quentin and may need some corrective editing for grammar and punctuation (SMILE). A lot of things have changed, some good and some not so good since the start of this quarantine. Again, thank you for your time and considering me.</br></br>

The Pandemic at San Quentin and What I See Every Six Feet</br></br>
 
Since March 27, 2020, the people at San Quentin State Prison’s West Block housing unit were notified by Memorandums generated from the Warden’s office, the Medical department and by Institutional television channel, that a staff member here tested positive for a contagious and deadly disease known as the coronavirus or COVID-19, and this disease has broken out into a global pandemic. Considering how I arrived at San Quentin, some history, the quarantines that I have experienced and what I see every six feet.</br></br>
 
In late November 2011, I was transferred to San Quentin’s North Block housing unit from Soledad Central though the Prison Re-Alignment Program. After a little over a year, I was transferred to San Quentin’s West Block housing unit. This is how I arrived at San Quentin. While here I realized that San Quentin has a wealth of history.</br></br>
 
Well, San Quentin is the first California prison built on dry land, in the mid-1800’s. It has the history of housing the most remembered prisoners even decades later. It is the home of California’s Death Row, but now San Quentin is also housing level one, level two, and Fire Camp people, sponsoring the most and some of the best self-help classes of any other California prison- like the one program called “The Beat Within.”</br></br>
 
The prison bears the face of its first hospital depicting the chiseled date of 1852 and known for its dungeon that is still intact. Yes, I wondered about how is this possible with all the ongoing renovating our multiple decades, with the building of additional housing units, office buildings, and the new hospital- which seems to be stacked right on top of the dungeon. All the other buildings seem to be built all around it.</br></br> 

How many other secretes does San Quentin have camouflaged in this maze? The amazing thing to me is that San Quentin State Prison is “California’s First Love,” for incarcerating people. A prison landmark, still active. A reservoir of blood running over the sides with the life and pain of many.</br></br>

All I can say at this point is that I am thankful that people still think of those who walk these dimly lit housing unites each day working to change their lives for the better. While here at San Quentin, I have experienced many quarantines.</br></br>
 
Almost nine years later, quarantines continue whether in our communities or within the incarcerated population. Things like influenza, chickenpox, shingles, norovirus, legionnaires, and yes Coronavirus.</br></br> 

Incarceration also forces you to think about other pre-existing illnesses like cancers, diabetes, hepatitis, kidney, heart and lung disease, HIV, mental health conditions, age, day-to-day living, etc.- just to name a few. Stack these things on top of prison overcrowding and it creates a hodgepodge of people and uncontrolled problems. But somehow California’s prison system continues to grow fatter on the flesh of our loved ones-inside and outside these institutions.</br></br>

As an incarcerated man, this is what I see.</br></br>
 
Well, what I do see in West Block housing unit during this global quarantine. First, I will describe the unit briefly. West Block has two sides known as the “yard-side” and the “bay-side.” Both sides are five stories high and built inside of the same housing unit. There are two people placed in each cell, presently housing over 800 plus people.</br></br> 

Beginning with one of the orders issued by the Warden’s office to those placed and work at San Quentin is “KEEP SIX-FEET-AWAY from others while in waiting areas, showers, medical appointments, yard, etc. and wash your hands with soap and water for twenty-seconds, cough or sneeze into your elbow.” Keeping these orders in mind with the buildings structure.</br></br> 

There are twenty-four shower heads placed about three feet apart, showering every other day. Twelve telephones placed about three-feet apart until the recent change, moving the telephones six-feet apart, but not adding more. This is the structure, what about supplies?</br></br>
 
West Block’s housing unit issues out one bar of soap and one roll of toilet paper per person each week. Other prisons issue out double. Just recently two-cloth face masks were issued to each person. One twelve-ounce bottle of hand sanitizer was issued per person. One may ask, how are the people here fed?</br></br>
 
West Block’s meal release is done by releasing entire tiers of people at the same time to retrieve a meal from the first tier from Housing unit porters. West Block is dimly lit and the roof is exposing insulation. These are some of the things that I see during this quarantine.</br></br> 

You tell me if staff and the people living here can adhere to these orders given. The way I arrived at San Quentin, some history, the prison’s quarantines, and what I see every six feet.</br></br>

Incarceration Changed</br></br>
 
Incarcerated child to incarcerated man or woman. One may ask how is this possible? I believe it is possible in a world where it is accepted as a form of continued punishment. It is accepted in a world full of hate or false traditions, which all paved the way down this “yellow brick road” right into mass incarceration. Ask yourself, why would one want to incarcerate another?</br></br>

Is it really for punishment or vengeance, hatred or discrimination, false traditions or for profit or just for the status quo? You tell me. I want to consider growing up in my community, crime and government solutions and if incarceration can be changed.</br></br>
 
Growing up as a young kid it seemed that I had no problems, no worries, no personal hang-ups or hate towards anyone because I thought as a child. While living in a community with my family I felt safe. The people in my community felt safe and supported one another.</br></br>

I can still remember walking to school with my mother as a young kid and our neighbors would speak to us, make sure we were doing well and encourage my education. My community had hard working people. I can remember PTA-meetings, school bus field trips, Boys and Girls clubs, summer camps, sports teams, etc. What happened?</br></br> 

What happened to the restorative justice our community used if a kid broke a window, or took a neighbors bike, our community solved these things, the System solved more serious problems. Now in my teens these things in my community drastically began to change. My neighbors became more and more silent and the youth began to follow this enticing “yellow brick road” right into separation and destruction.</br></br>
 
Our communities became saturated with drugs, gangs, crime and abuse. Fear began to show its frightened face everywhere creating a public out-cry so loud something had to be done, but what? I thought no one really wanted to understand how these things gradually began to occur or if something other than incarceration could correct these serious problems.</br></br> 

In fact, our government decided to act in a forceful and violent way drafting laws as though we had non already. These new and harsher laws began to fall from our beautiful blue and white sky like the manna in the days of old written about in the Holy scriptures, where the Children of Israel ate manna for forty years until they came to border of the land of Canaan (Exodus 16:35). That manna was a bread that sustained the Children of Israel.</br></br> 

This new manna of laws did the complete opposite, it began to poison our communities, separate families by incarceration, scar, cripple and kill tens of thousands of citizens across the country including myself as a youth for life. This new manna of laws were being forced by all means necessary by our state and governmental agencies. This free rein of law enforcement power brought our military weapons like the “Batter-Ram” spoke about in Los Angeles years ago amongst other military machinery to fight against the drug and crime epidemic prevailing in our communities.</br></br>

Government officials began to yell out terms like “LOCK EM’ UP AND THROW AWAY THE KEY, SAY NOPE-TO-DOPE, JUVENILES ARE CRIMINAL PREDATORS, AND THE LIKE.” I believe that cliché’s like these caused further separation in our communities, in our humanities and amplified racism across our country. In all this, if one is ignorant of the law or living in poverty or both, there is no excuse.</br></br>

At some point you will be incarcerated and forever scared.</br></br>
 
I believe that every living being should not be confined their entire life. What would justify this? Robbery, assault, murder? Even the Children of Israel did not eat manna forever.I personally believe that this man made “BEAST” began with a mind-set. One that did not reckon with the consequences of what would come.</br></br> 

With this new debased and deliberate mindset and this so-called “law and order push” incarceration blossomed faster than a dark gray mushroom cloud with the stench of mold that has and still is eating away at our beautiful country, state-by-state. MASS INCARCERATION.</br></br>

A man made “BEAST” I think so, but it begins with our families, our communities and governments. What’s ironic is that our Systems continue to roar its voice about rehabilitation and reforms, but incarceration still peaks its ugly face over many jail and prison walls right now!</br></br>
 
Incarceration and separation and discrimination has been taught to generations of people including to me. This belief will choke your soul to death if you let it defeat you. I believe that something can be done to change the way we incarcerate, but this is what we do as people.</br></br>

For instance, we put fish in bowls, birds in cages, animals in pins and of course people (children, women, and men) in cells and want to confine them for decades even life. If you ask me this is the true meaning of cruel and unusual besides the hanging of a innocent man or woman, no matter how one spins it.</br></br>
 
Can a world without incarceration or different forms of punish be possible within the same mind-set of government who build this “BEAST?” I don’t think so, but who am I, one incarcerated person. A warden told me “the only way to fix a establishment is to replace it with another.”</br></br> 

At that time I did not understand what she mean, but I do now at this point in my prison bid. All I can do is pray for a better way. What if I click the heels of my prison boots together like Dorothy in the Wizard of Oz and wish everyone who finds themselves incarcerated physically or mentally away from that dreadful “yellow brick road” onto that narrow straight street that leads right into Heavens Gate where true freedom lives.</br></br>

Has incarceration changed?</br></br>

Isolation and Incarceration</br></br>
 
Due to this present global pandemic our local governmental officials issued “shelter in place and social distancing orders,” in effort to fight this new Corona virus also known as COVID-19. This disease has taken over 58,000 lives across the U.S., according to NBC news, Today in the Bay, Wednesday, April 29, 2020.</br></br>
 
During this period, some people are not able to leave their homes to secure food and other supplies, some people have no home to go to, some people have become unemployed while others continue in their specialty employment. This seems to be the beginning of more unsettled times to come that will affect the mentality and stability of our country in many different ways. I will consider some similarities of isolation in our society and how isolation affect the incarcerated population.</br></br>
 
Taking a brief look at our societies, some of the community streets and businesses are almost emptied due to the shelter in place and social distancing orders. Some of our cities are liken to modern day ghost-towns. Families in some cases are forced to stay at their homes, like it or not, until these orders are lifted. Some people find this very difficult and some think it is very unbearable and also causes mental anguish and hostility amongst family members and friends.</br></br> 

These orders have left to higher rates of domestic violence within the home, according to local news reports. Some people have become hoarders, others aggressive shoppers, and some deliberately violate both orders going out into public parks, beaches, parties, etc. in crowds with knowledge that the authorities will give warnings, issue citations, fines and you may be arrested for violating these orders. It is beyond belief that some people still risk the chance of possible infection, the risk of infection others, hospitalization or even death.</br></br>
 
The shelter in place and social distancing orders do sound and look familiar if viewed in the eyes of those who have contracted COVID-19, those who have been sheltering in place and those who are and have been housed within the incarcerated population.</br></br>
 
It seems that many people in our communities feel that being confined within their homes in light of these orders is a form of punishment, but we do not understand that the safety of all is crucial, not just the safety of some and there should be no divide here.</br></br>
 
I will add that from afar it seems that the shelter in place and social distancing orders have and still is saving lives, but I believe that it is safe to say that the shelter in place and social distancing orders do not apply to the incarcerated population, and citizens are not being incarcerated within their own homes, but I think that they are just feeling a slight pinch on the arm of what actual incarceration feels like physically and mentally even if it is minor.</br></br>
 
Well, I can say that being incarcerated during this global pandemic has brought uncertainty and a landslide of unanswered questions, for instance: How long will this modified programming continue within the prison system? Will the incarcerated population be tested for COVID-19 if symptoms are consistent with this disease anytime after?</br></br> 

What if incarcerated people contract COVID-19, will they receive proper medical care and ventilator’s if needed to have hope for a positive outcome for them and their families? Are the incarcerated population housed at 100-year old plus institutions more at risk during this pandemic? Will staff continue to work in these facilities if they have been exposed or are found to be a-symptomatic? Will a large portion of the incarcerated population be considered for release or parole prior to contracting this disease based upon their time served, age, medical history, post conviction behavior, etc. because COVID-19 is highly contagious and a deadly disease that can devastate the incarcerated population which is already extremely overburdened?</br></br>

These are just a few relevant questions asked by those who are incarcerated. The issuance of a cloth face mask and a small bottle of hand sanitizer is not the remedy nor moving or transferring the prison population around and around during an active pandemic. No one is requesting the key to these doors but something has to be done.</br></br>
 
Some citizens who have had no contact with jail or prison facilities or with those who are or have been incarcerated may have never heard of nor understand some basic day-to-day conditions living inside these facilities. I will share a portion of this being incarcerated myself. One common experience with the incarcerated population young and old is at 9pm all movement if any ends and the lights go out.</br></br> 

Some people are ordered to stay on their bunk, while others like myself are locked in a cell until the next day. TOTAL ISOLATION! Just watching the guard count me and my celly and key-lock the door from the outside is something else. It feels like being locked in a garage like a lawn mower or some other property. The only difference is that lawn mower doesn’t wonder if anyone is coming back to unlock that door, but people do.</br></br>
 
After 9pm each night my building becomes violently silent with the acoustic buzz of whirling fans, toilets flushing, sinks running, the heaviness of large keys carried by officers as they secure the building and the occasional blaring alarm that comes on when someone yells out “man down!” over and over and over until the officers investigates to see if someone has a problem or needs help. These sounds are almost invisible during the day-to-day chaos. At this time my mind opens to a variety of things that take isolation to another level of consciousness within this very small space called a cell.</br></br> 

One thing for sure, is that it is easy to fall into a depressive state of being sleeping off days and even nights doing absolutely nothing for long periods of time and no one seems to care. Being incarcerated is depressively redundant because everything even the food is exactly the same day after day, in effect “time stops where incarceration begins.” My mind also opens to a entirely different focus because I do pray, meditate, read and write.</br></br>

As I do these things in this small cell I have to lay on this hard steel bunk that is terribly uncomfortable or sit on a bucket all of which deteriorates my posture day by day even when I watch my portable television tell me stories or entertain me. My portable radio is on all day and sometimes all night because I love the sound of music and it blocks out the chaos around me. I do have redundant thoughts about the things that I have done good and bad.</br></br> 

I will not reveal my feelings at this time of being excluded, set apart or isolated from society, my family and even economically but I can say that I continually understand the consequences of doing bad things now and the hurt that comes with it but the pain of losing both my parents, people who have been there all their life for me is a different kind of hurt and a different kind of pain, especially while being isolated by incarceration.</br></br>
 
Some may say how do I cope with life while incarcerated? All I can say is that its never easy being confined like a wild beast when I am a human being. These things are never easy to explain or deal with some days because extreme lengths of continued incarceration is unnatural and sometimes cruel and unusual.</br></br>

Just being incarcerated and crammed in a small cell with another person with the energy, attitude, mental health status and stress of being locked away is a struggle in itself. Now, considering the social distancing order issued by our government is impossible to adhere to and our institutions are in violation of these orders and continue to resist lowering the prison population pursuant to previous mandated court orders and many laws allowing the prison system to act on its own by applying earned credit towards release, sentence recalls, the early release of youth offenders and elderly prisoners who have served specific terms even the parole board has the authority to do the same but the prison population is still overwhelming, I would ask why?</br></br>

Isolation can easily be a failure to act towards a individual or a population of people. Please don’t let our prison systems resemble a storm like Katrina in the eye of COVID-19. Incarceration and Isolation, when will these things change?
