It’s been hard because our normal program has been taken away as far as no school, no work, no self-help programs. Very limited, almost to none, canteen/commissary availability. Very limited, almost to none, yard recreational activity (maybe for one to two hours every fourth day, and this includes phone use as the phones are out on the yard).</br></br> 

Very limited, almost to none, vendor packages given and definitely no visits at all. No contact visits, no family visits, no behind the glass visits, zero, nothing. There are no dayroom (inside the building activities). And showers are very limited to the number that can be used and now they’ve only been open (given access to them) every third or fourth day approximately.
