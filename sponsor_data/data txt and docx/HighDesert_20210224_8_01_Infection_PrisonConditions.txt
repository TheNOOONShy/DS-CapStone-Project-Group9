This story was told by a person incarcerated at High Desert.</br></br>

Caller: So basically what the issue was, what it is right here is that this was one of the last prisons that was still programming while others had stronger restrictions in place.</br></br> 

UCI: Mhmm.</br></br> 

Caller: And by around the end of October 2020 it is when it began shutting down. A lot of us were lucky at the time to go to commissary but after that everything started shutting down and we were just subject to a lot of cruel and unusual punishment. And even our food portions, they started cutting down on that so what this pandemic did was it just made it worse for all prisoners basically. </br></br>

It's- we’re restricted to a lot of things, and the problem is the way they try to deal with it, it was too, they didn’t prepare for it. So by the time it reached this institution they started doing a lot of changes, trying to figure out what was the best solution.</br></br> 

So what they did started doing was within the past two months they started doing the nasal swab and that was going alright. But the problem with that was when people started getting sick or testing as positive they ended up taking both the inmate and the cellmate. And then after a while what they started doing is, they kept- they stopped taking the cellmate and they kept- they just took the other individual who was taken to another block and it was considered a quarantine block.</br></br> 

The problem with that was those individuals came back and then some of them tested asymptomatic. Now the thing with that is that if these individuals end up getting sick again or 'cause a lot of them didn’t feel symptoms, then they could easily spread it that includes through the ventilation system. So as far as controlling it, it’s gotten out of hand.
