This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Chino.</br></br>

Hello,</br></br>

I hope all is well in these truly uncertain times. I would like to formally introduce myself. My name is [redacted], I’m currently in Central Institution for Men which is located in Chino, California. For the purpose of gaining knowledge, I would ask that my information be used. I’m very much opposed to obscurantism.</br></br> 

Anywho for this to be an institution constituted by the state of California, it was very well lacking in protocol when the pandemic hit. Granted it was totally unexpected, so everyone had to get acclimated. I can say this, and I speak in earnesty, and truth.</br></br> 

As for Central Institution for Men, we’ve never been six feet away apart as far as our living conditions. Currently we have a mask but, this is something we had to fight for in the beginning. Because we are inmates naturally people tend to treat you like you’re not a full-on citizen.</br></br> 

Now not every staff member feels like this but. You do have individuals who like to remind you that they could care less. Like much of the general populace we were ignorant to the nature and facts of COVID-19. It was truly a sight to see on the news every day as the death toll rose.</br></br> 

We were all so worried about our family members not being able to physically be there was a very big challenge to most of us. A lot of skeptics said the government unleashed the virus, or that it was a form of population control. Me I knew this was something that would be here for a while.</br></br>

As for the first two to three months went by we fought first for masks. Then for adequate cleaning supplies in which it took two more months but, we received them. Earlier I spoke of the social distance aspect of our living arrangements, and I’ll say it again.</br></br>

In the beginning we weren’t six feet apart and even currently, we’re not. When the pandemic first hit this prison was the worst hit, we actually had 17 or more deaths from what I know. I actually was associated with two people who actually passed away.</br></br>

Through introspection I’ve reflected on that, and I must say it was pretty difficult. One of the gentlemen had been incarcerated for more than 20 years. In which he had seven years left, and to succumb to something like COVID-19. For that to be the end, it was terrible.</br></br>

Of course they sent his belongings home, and when the officers gathered his things I couldn’t help but think. He did all that time survived some pretty bad prison experiences and died from coronavirus. At that his family is being sent paperwork, and Top Ramen noodles to remember him by.</br></br>

So at about the fifth month of 2020 they started a mass releasing system. Any non-violent offender within six months of going home was released. This was truly a good thing because it allowed us to get a little more space.</br></br>

So normally there would be 178-190 inmates housed in a 200-man dorm. That number was drastically reduced to 50 inmates per dorm give or take. So all in all our efforts could’ve been way better and naturally because we are inmates we were treated (excuse my French) like shit but, being incarcerated you have to be resilient.</br></br>

So we have looked ahead to better days. As far as quarantining goes we were already quarantining if you feel my drift. We’re locked up already. So really the world kind of got a sense of what it’s like for your freedom to be taken. Thanks for your time, and efforts.</br></br>

Yours truly.
