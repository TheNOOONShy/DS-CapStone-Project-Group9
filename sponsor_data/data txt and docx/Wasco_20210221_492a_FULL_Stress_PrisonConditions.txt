Hi. I’ve been at WSP ever since the pandemic. It has not been fair at all. You can't do anything but make sure everything is clean around you without the proper cleaning supplies.</br></br>
With no visits to see your family, it’s all bad. But in God’s will at these days this is the end of the pandemic. The CO that work in this place is not respectful to us at all.</br></br>
And on top of that we have to keep our cool. But I don’t want to take up the whole sheet of paper telling you bad things. If you write me I will tell you more. Thank you so much. God bless.
