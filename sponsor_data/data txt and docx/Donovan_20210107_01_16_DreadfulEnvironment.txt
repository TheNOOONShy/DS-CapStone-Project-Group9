This story was told by a person incarcerated at Richard J. Donovan Correctional Facility.</br></br>

And then the outbreak itself was repeating, the cycle was repeating itself on this facility as all five buildings were infected. Over 900-plus inmates. And this is facts. Most of the infection was coming from free staff in the central kitchen.</br></br>

They were allowing inmates to go to work who were contaminated and they were contaminating our food. This is an ongoing problem right now. And five inmates in my building alone have died since December 15th.</br></br>

And there was a report of four or three other inmates that are currently under severe critical care in the San Diego hospital right now from my building alone. A release, press release to the San Diego County press, telling them that, you know, 300-400 inmates were infected with COVID-19 which is an outrageous lie. The entire population, and I’ve talked to several inmates on every yard and they’ve also experienced the same thing.</br></br>

Now, between December 12th and December 20- 29th or the 30th, we have a complete collapse here on this institution. Each yard employs 32 officers per watch. Per watch. And that's on a normal shift.</br></br>

Between December 12th and December 20- 29th and 30th, there was no more than 10 officers on this yard, on any time, at any watch. Five officers during, getting the guards hours of these buildings— five buildings—and only five officers for the whole yard on every watch. Trash, trash was stockpiled in front of each housing unit, eight feet high.</br></br>

There was a total collapse. There was no officers, no wardens, nobody wanted to come check on this. They weren't even testing anybody at the, during the pinnacle of the outbreak itself. And now we're still dealing with them.
