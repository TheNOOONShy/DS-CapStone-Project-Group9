This story was told by a person incarcerated at Mule Creek.</br></br>


UCI: I was going to ask how has this situation at your facility affected your loved ones?</br></br>


Caller: More so, my observation of other people, because like my loved ones are not really, you know, in that much support of me. I've been incarcerated since '98 and I'm 46 now, so unfortunately, you lose loved ones as your time in incarceration, you know, continues. But in seeing other people's responses, man. It's a bit overwhelming.</br></br>


And you know, to see how as an inmate being in a community these men in here even cry because, you know, at one particular point in time they were not able to see their families. But now, for like the last month in a half, maybe two, there have been video visitations allotted to us. And they have recently opened up to where if people meet certain protocol, again, hence what I said earlier about the non-vaccination, then they can, you know, receive visitors — an hour visit with their loved ones.</br></br>


But that’s-, but look though, I'm like from Los Angeles, California and where I'm presently located is in a city called Ione. Somewhere by Sac-, you are in Irvine, you're in Irvine. So, I mean, if you know California a little bit, you know this is by Sacramento. And so, if you consider the distance that's traveled, who would want to travel from Los Angeles area, or even Orange County, to Sacramento to get an hour visit.</br></br>


So, still there's a great, I want to say, conflict, you know? And hassle, and emotional affect on those who are so positioned, you know?</br></br>


UCI: Oh-.</br></br>


Caller: Yeah, so I mean-. I'm sorry, go ahead.</br></br>


UCI: No, go ahead.</br></br>


Caller: And so, while there is still some level of, you know, sadness and melancholy based on the lack of, you know, physical contact that we can have with people that we know and love us-. CDCR, I can give some credit to them for trying to implement a visitation for prisoners again. So, I mean that's something to look up to.
