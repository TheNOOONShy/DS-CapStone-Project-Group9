This letter was written by a person incarcerated at CSATF (California Substance Abuse Treatment and State Prison, Corcoran). </br> </br>       To whom, it may concern, I’m writing this in response to a letter that I’ve received from you. First let me thank you for your kind words, thoughts, and insight. It’s a blessing to know that I’m (we) are thought about. Especially in these trying times. </br> </br>       I was shocked to hear from you. UCI students? Well congratulations. Hopefully I can be some assistance. </br> </br>       Is this just some study? Be honest. Don’t mind either way I’m willing to help. To answer your questions. </br> </br>       It’s been hectic being “inside” during the pandemic, protest, politics, etc. Feels unreal. I feel so outta touch with the world. As for as inside it’s hell. I say they don’t know what they’re doing. I’m guessing because this has never happened before. Once people became positive, hold on rewind. </br> </br>       First we wasn’t given mask until May. And they were made out of old shirts and pants by other inmates while staff wore regular mask. Once people tested nobody was positive. Word is staff brought in it. Well how else did it or would it had got in right? </br> </br>       They made people who tested positive move to other parts of the prison instead of quarantining them. Then the remaining people who were left in the pod (eight man living quarters), they moved them in other pods with people who didn’t test positive. When they should’ve been quarantined as well being they was exposed. </br> </br>       Everyone is concerned about their safety, well being, health. There is a lack of cleaner disinfectant, sanitation, etc. There has been 15 deaths that I know of. There’s NO way to social distance. You can't control how the next person carries themself. It’s sad. </br> </br>       I could say more but I doubt you will receive it. I filed a petition for release due to COVID and it was never received. SMH. </br> </br>	On that note, </br> </br>       God bless. Continue to strive for your dreams. And change. </br> </br>       Yours truly </br> </br>       [Redacted] </br> </br>
