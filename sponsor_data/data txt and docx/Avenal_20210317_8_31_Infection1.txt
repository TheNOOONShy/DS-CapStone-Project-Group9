This story was told by a person incarcerated at Avenal.</br></br>

Caller: And we're, you know, of course, we're now, we're going into this, these new strains. And you know, like today on the, on the radio, I heard that inmates were getting vaccinated before COs. Well, that's a lie. And that's a complete lie, because they did vaccinate the never-nevers.</br></br> 

But no one else has been offered it and I would say less than 38 percent, or even lower of the COs actually took the vaccine, and a lot of them got sick when they took it. Likewise with the inmates.</br></br>

UCI: So are the vaccinations being offered to inmates?</br></br>

Caller: Just to the never-nevers, the people that allegedly never had it, but-</br></br> 

UCI: Oh.</br></br>

Caller: But they were like, just people that were just scared because when you reported it, they'll like, they moved us all to one building and put all the sick people together, right on top of each other. And it's like, when you put sick people with sick people, you get sicker people, because I caught it twice.</br></br>

I had it once in January. And then I caught it, I've tested positive again in July 28. And then they threw us in a building and they were doing moves at like 11 or 12 o'clock at night, and they put us all in the building and then I got really, really sick. But the problem is, like, a lot of us, like I'm a lifer. We’ve been down for a long time.</br></br> 

They just, our property and stuff, they, if you get sick and they take you out, they just leave your property sitting there, you know, unattended, you know, people could steal it or whatever. It's like, I just said to myself, if I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die. I'm not gonna, I have too much legal property. I've been fighting for my life for the last, you know, 21 years I’ve been in prison.</br></br>

And I wasn't going to take the chance to leave my property just sitting there for unattended, for anybody just to pilfer or steal or whatever.
