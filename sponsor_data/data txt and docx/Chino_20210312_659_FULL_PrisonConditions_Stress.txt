This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Chino.</br></br>

I’m an inmate at CIM (Chino Institution for Men). This is a high-risk medical facility. Ever since the pandemic started there have been a number of issues pertaining people’s life. The count that shows the number of inmates sick and death count are not shown in an updated summary of Plata/Coleman litigation or legal news.</br></br> 

At one point, CIM had or has the highest cases due to COVID-19. I have been tested three different times and all three results have been negative. The practice of the six feet rule has not been enforced with bunks three feet apart from another. People with positive test results are mingling with negative test results inmates.</br></br>

I see on the news everyday the seriousness of the pandemic. Why do we have to fight? Put in paper after paper work just to know If I’m going to be alive when I wake up. We are human beings with the right to live, be safe, health wise and to know if things will be OK in the future.</br></br> 

I have accumulated a number of mental health issues. PTSD has affected my everyday life. Negative feelings about people, thinking everyone I come in contact with is going to give me COVID- 19. To the point I can’t talk to people, work, or interact with anyone.</br></br> 

Also depression is hitting me hard to the point negative thinking pops up in my head. COVID-19 is very stressful, and the people that have COVID-19 are very depressing. I would like to be a part of any lawsuit that has to deal with incarcerated inmates with COVID-19 and the ones without it that have a chance to get it.</br></br>

It would be highly appreciated for you to contact me with answers about COVID-19 lawsuit cases.</br></br>

Thank you.
