This story was told by a person incarcerated at Santa Clara Main Jail.</br></br>

Caller: During this pandemic, we’ve been dropping like flies. Our whole– our whole facility– is exceeding over with COVID pandemic inmates that are infected. It’s a huge outbreak up here.</br></br>

They don’t powerwash the rooms, the cells, after they– it’s like one inmate after inmate coming through the cells. Sometimes women, you know, they come in there off their addictions. Feces on the floor, blood on the wall.</br></br>

Like they just shove us in these cells. Like we’ve been waiting for the booster shot and it’s been a whole month. They keep telling us that we gon’ get a booster shot– we ain’t got our booster shot.</br></br>

They not washing down the chains that they– after they come in contact with after inmate after inmate. I mean, then they handcuff us so tight that we get skin tears and we needing almost stitches. And one time they choked me with a chain to try to subdue me and round my neck.</br></br>

And then you know what? Then they let these people call us Black people ni**ers all day, taking extra program time. Then you know what else they do?</br></br>

They pass kites– and then we was here when that one officer was selling everybody drugs. Officer [redacted]. Man, Elmwood DOC is the dirtiest place in the whole entire world. Even our paddy wagons to transfer to court.</br></br>

They got this caked up with just debris, it was just blood, all that shit. I was like “Damn, why don’t y’all even powerwash.” They call it biohazards, the rule, they call it power washing the rooms out. They don’t even do that shit, man.</br></br>

It’s just– that’s why we droppin’ like flies. We over here dying like the prison compounds was dying up in San Quentin. And you know what? You know, some people don’t even wanna come in and get the booster shot or the main COVID test.</br></br>

They gotta ask you whether or not to take the test. And you know, America right now, they telling people that just to have a job they gotta be mandated– you know, COVID-19 vaccine. You know, you go people in here spitting on the– today we got our door spit on.
