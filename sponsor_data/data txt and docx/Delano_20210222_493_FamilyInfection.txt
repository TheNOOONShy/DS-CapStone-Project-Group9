This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Delano </br></br>Dear PrisonPandemic, </br></br>I was not going to write back at first but if you could take time to write me, surely, I could give you a little back. I won’t ask you to forgive me of any grammar, punctuation on and etc. in advance. I don’t know what I plan on saying at all and I will try to keep it neat. Its late, I have a move on using the TV light to write so I can let my celly sleep. </br></br>For me this whole virus thing has been harder on those around me than me. I took 17 years at 85% right before all this happened. I messed up bad. I’ve lost everything and it has my feelings numbed in a way I’ve locked out the world. I tested positive in January. For me I felt sick for around 72 hours. Felt like the flu. I lost my taste for 3-4 weeks which was the worst. My celly at the time had a real rough go. The worst part is a couple things. One is I’m in a confined space with hundreds of people smashed in a box. Once any sickness to anything happens it spreads like wildfire. There is no way for me personally or the state to really and truly protect us from something like this. The other worst part is how if you test positive, they just move you…let me just say what I went through </br></br>I tested came back positive. Told pack my things. Moved in middle of the night to another yard with my celly. Placed in a cell that was never cleaned and left filthy between several other people. I asked for cleaning supplies and was forced in and told no. The cell they moved us to has no power outlets. The normal mainline cells do so we can plug in our TV or radio etc, They only let us shower every three days. The food is served on little paper trays. Its good, but nowhere near the amount they served on mainline. We literally felt hungry nonstop. At first you’re sick and can’t eat, but then you get better and they barely fed you. Last was quarantine was to last 14 days, I showed no real symptoms and have good vital checks every time. I was there 24 days not once did they tell me why. When I asked medical and custody staff, they just blamed the next man. I had to file paperwork just to get a supervisor to hear my complaint to get help. Oh, and the worst part was this was since December 22 to mid-January. They also didn’t and still don’t allow phone calls to anyone in quarantine. Ok im going to end this with not be able to kiss my kids or hold my girls hand or visit for this long is real depressing on all of us. Hope this helps. If I can help again or if you just need someone to talk to I’m here. </br></br>Sincerely.
