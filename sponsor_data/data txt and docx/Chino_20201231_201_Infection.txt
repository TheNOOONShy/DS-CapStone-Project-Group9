I became infected twice back in August and in September and luckily I had no symptoms. I do know others who here who actually suffered symptoms and they told me they felt like they were going to die.</br></br>

I was shocked because this was coming from an 18-year-old friend. He recuperated luckily and I do not take this COVID-19 lightly. Really it has been a turn of events and uncertainty.
