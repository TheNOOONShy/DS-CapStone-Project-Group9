This story was told by a person incarcerated at Donovan.</br></br>


UCI: So what has the COVID situation been like at your facility?</br></br>


Caller: Well it’s been kinda slow, you know they’ve been locking, they’ve been locking us up for, we’ve been locked out for a while and it just run, they don’t run program you what I mean? Like it used to because they shut it down, so it slowly getting back to normal, you know what I mean?</br></br>


UCI: Yeah.</br></br>


Caller: Yeah, we got our, our vaccine already, you know what I mean?</br></br>


UCI: So I heard, my bad my bad, I heard that, that a breakout just happened at that facility. I don’t know if I’m correct about that.</br></br>


Caller: Yes, it did.</br></br>


UCI: And so, how, how has that situation been like? I don’t know if you were already describing it. I’m sorry if I interrupted.</br></br>


Caller: No, no, see, what had, what had happened is that we were on phase two. They were running, you know, you know, like yard and the game room with other buildings. But then we heard that on A yard broke out, again, so they shut us down. They started testing us again.</br></br>


And I guess today, they, they put us back to phase two, which is the way they had it before the, before the outbreak happened on A yard.</br></br>


UCI: Okay.</br></br>


Caller: And started learning program now, that’s why I’m calling you.</br></br>


UCI: And some questions that I did need to ask is, do, do you know of any like, any members of the population at Donovan currently have COVID?</br></br>


Caller: That I know, not in this building.</br></br>


UCI: Okay, and -</br></br>


Caller: But if they did, they, what they do is they quarantine the whole building. Or they, they have a building on, on a different yard, where they share the people that are quarantined for 20 days.</br></br>


UCI: And -</br></br>


Caller: A week, like about two weeks ago, somebody, somebody, you know, they took somebody in the celly, to that, to that building because they, they, I guess they, they had it.</br></br>


UCI: Okay, and -</br></br>


Caller: But basically nobody like, other than that, nobody has it right here, cause they give us testing like I said, in, on Friday.</br></br>


UCI: Okay, and in regards to the prison staff, do you know any of them, if they got any, any, anything like that?</br></br>


Caller: Well, they leave, like, they, they, like, when they don’t run program, they say they short of staff, it’s because either some of them are protesting that in, and they don’t want to come to work, or, they, they have it, I don’t know, I’m not sure. They don’t tell us who has it or, or who doesn’t because it’s been different CO’s that come in and work in here. So we don’t, we won’t get that information unless we hear, you know like rumours or something, you know what I mean?</br></br>


UCI: Yeah, and how, and to your perspective, how well do you think the staff are handling this current outbreak?</br></br>


Caller: Well, I think, I think it’s alright, you know I mean, you know, I think there are, there has been, you know it’s what anybody can, you know what I mean? I myself, you know, try to stay in the house, try to stay in the cell, instead of coming out, and when I do come out, before anything I, I got my mask on, you what I mean? Cause they give us masks.</br></br>


UCI: And do you have any current concerns?</br></br>


Caller: No. No, no not really you know I mean, as far as I know, cause I, I think like I said I get tested on Friday so I don’t have that. You know, but before that, a whole bunch of people had it, you know what I mean, but did not get quarantined.</br></br>


UCI: Okay.</br></br>


Caller: I just, as a precaution I just stay, I just stay in my cell, you know what I mean, I, as much time I can. Each time I come out, I only come out is to get my, my, my food, my tray, or something like that.</br></br>


UCI: Okay, and how has this, how has the vaccination situation been like at your facility?</br></br>


Caller: Well, they, they in February, the end of February, they, they, when was it, February 5th, they, they, they gave me my first shot and the 28th they gave me my second shot. So we pretty much, I guess everybody that, that was, that was in the shot, you know what I mean, got it, you know what I mean? So that’s why they’re letting us program a little bit.</br></br>


UCI: And how has it been like with reduced visitation and programming?</br></br>


Caller: Well the, the visitation, for a minute there, they were, they were doing it with like zoom and recently they started, they started giving, like one day is like one it’s hyper, one day Saturday is zoom still, and then Sunday is contact visit, but, they have to show that, they have, they have to come, I mean they have to come to the prison, like ahead of time so they can get tested themselves. And if they’re, if they’re clear they can go. They let them in, for about an hour.</br></br>


UCI: And how have you been coping with this crisis?</br></br>


Caller: Well, personally, I’ve been, you know, been myself, I’ve been doing alright, so. The only, the only thing is work about the family, you know that I mean?</br></br>


UCI: Yeah -</br></br>


Caller: I’ve been bad, I’ve been in here so long that I just get with it, you know what I mean, it just comes, you know what I mean?</br></br>


UCI: And on that note, how has your loved ones been affected by the COVID situation?</br></br>


Caller: Well, they’re, they’re pretty much the same. They’re worried about me.</br></br>


UCI: And -</br></br>


Caller: But -</br></br>


UCI: Sorry about that.</br></br>


Caller: Yeah?</br></br>


UCI: And what, what would have made the situation at your facility better?</br></br>


Caller: Man, I don’t know how, I don't know how to respond to that because I’ve been in here so long, so I’ve been dealing with a lot of this stuff for years. I mean, and this is the first time we dealt with this so it’s like, it’s like anybody else, you know I mean, I guess. You have to, you know, just deal with it as it comes.</br></br>


UCI: Yeah, and so regard, like, besides that, like is there anything that you would like people to know about the, your experience with COVID-19?</br></br>


Caller: Me personally, I just, just worry about the family and, and the people out there, you know what I mean? But you know, I can’t, I can’t, I can’t, how do you say, answer something where we’re at, you know I’ve never been through, you know, you know none of this, you know what I mean, so. The only thing I care about is that, you know, people out there seem to don’t, don’t care about other people.</br></br>


UCI: Yeah.</br></br>


Caller: You know, so I call it, all this protesting and shit, and about not, not, you know, not wearing a mask out there or not wanting to get the vaccine themselves, you know what I mean? They’re not, they’re not worrying about other people. That’s, that’s, that’s the only thing I, I care about.</br></br>


In here, the only thing you can control is yourself. You can’t, you can’t control or, or, and, and how they, how the, the CO’s and the system, you know, deals with it, cause we can't do nothing about it.</br></br>


UCI: Yeah that is understandable, you can only do as much as you can do, right.</br></br>


Caller: It’s, It’s like, It’s like, like my mother always said, why worry about things you can’t control.</br></br>


UCI: Right. And do you -</br></br>


Caller: I just, I just try to, stay, you know, sane, you know what I mean? Do, do my, do my program.</br></br>


UCI: And do you, do you have any questions for me about the program or anything like that?</br></br>


Caller: No, just that I appreciate, you know, you guys taking an interest in, but that’s about it.</br></br>


UCI: Well we appreciate you calling as well.</br></br>


Caller: And, and that hopefully, hopefully what I had to say helps out, you know what I mean, with whatever that, that program you guys going, you know, I hope that I was helpful in some way.</br></br>


UCI: Yeah, hopefully.</br></br>


Caller: That’s about it. You got anymore questions?</br></br>


UCI: Despite the outbreak, besides the question about the outbreak and all that, I think you gave us really good information and I just wanted to say thank you for participating in the PrisonPandemic Project and if you have any friends or anybody you would like to, to tell about this project or any family members that, that would like to call as well to tell their story and how they’re experiencing, you know someone, someone they love inside the prison system.</br></br>


Caller: What I’m going to do is I’m, what I’m going to do is I’m going to ask my sister if, if she wants to call and put her input that’s why I really, my sister’s the only one, you know, she does everything for me. That’s who I call when I, you know, when I want to talk to somebody.</br></br>


UCI: Of course.</br></br>


Caller: I’m going to ask her if she wants to do it and if she does, then you’ll be hearing from her.</br></br>


UCI: Thank you, yeah and just, just to let you know we, we, the hotline is open from five to 9, Monday through Friday.</br></br>


Caller: Okay, okay.</br></br>


UCI: Alight.</br></br>


Caller: Alright, thank you and you guys have a good day. Keep on doing, you know, keep on doing your thing, you know what I mean? And thank you for worrying about us.</br></br>
