First and foremost my name is [redacted] and I am incarcerated at the moment, I have been in prison for about eight years now. The reason why I’m writing this letter it’s because I would like to share my personal story about how this corona virus pandemic has changed and impacted my life, the life of my family, and the life of others here in prison. I remember when I first heard if this pandemic on (December of 2019) on the news.</br></br>


I was in isolation at the time at Corcoran State Prison, security housing unit (shu). I remember the way they used to talk about this pandemic on the news. They made it seem like it was just a big issue but just in China. That day I remember sending a letter to my mom to tell her to get more information on this virus and its updates.</br></br>


At that time just hearing about it was nerve wrecking, but the day I really started panicking and getting more worried about my family was when the government started shutting down all airports. A few big states and all transportation from prison. It was then when I started worrying about my family and loved ones even more.</br></br>


Seeing the virus spreading fast all over the world was depressing, sad, and impacting specially for someone like me inside these prison walls. Knowing that there was a lot of people from this virus and I couldn’t do anything from in here to help it was depressing. I remember when the pandemic hit the hardest in this country, I wanted to be out there to help.</br></br> 


Fast froward a few months later after going through all these, the sadness, the depression, the anxiety and the loneliness without hearing not a single word from my family and love ones the corona virus hit my prison facility real hard. Staff members, nurses and correctional officers getting infected of COVID-19. So it got to the point where CDCR shutted down all visitation and our phone calls, including our program and all movement was shut down.</br></br>


We weren’t able to come out from our cells 24/7 it was lock down all day and night without a slime chance to talk or see our family members. Those days printed another dark chapter in my life, I didn’t know what was going on with my family? I didn’t know if they were OK? I didn’t know if they had caught Covid? I didn’t know if they had food to eat?</br></br>


I was real worried about them specially about my mom because she is older and she has some medical issues and my older brother he has high risk diabetes and he needs to take shots of insulin a couple of times a day. So when this virus took its toll here in California and I didn’t have any contact with my family what so ever. I fell into a deep depression and started living some real dark days, worst than the ones I’m already living inside this prison.</br></br>


This has been an experience that felt like if I was living in hell for a few months. By the month of April 2020 all inmates in my facility started getting tested for covid including myself. We started getting tested at least three or four times a month and on the first week of covid testing a lot of inmates tested positive. Which CDCR shutted down a whole building in our facility to re-house inmates that were infected with the virus.</br></br>


That building was called the Isolation Block, everything was like a nightmare. It seem like a building and scenes that came out of a terror movie. Inmates started going to the outside hospitals because COVID got them real sick. Even a few friends that I made here in prison passed away due to COVID, which I’m hoping and praying that God has them all in his glory, blessed with his love and mercy.</br></br>


I also know that God has send all his love and peace to their family as well. May God bless them all! It was until June that I finally received a letter from my family and after reading it my life changed completely, by knowing that all my family was in good health through that letter even though they all caught COVID. I can say with a big smile on my face that I came back from the dead and I was able to see a light at the end of the tunnel.</br></br>


All those days that I didn’t know anything about my family, and knowing that people were dying out there every day due to COVID. To me it was like been torture, it was like dying slowly and my heart been ripped out of my chest. But it was a short period of time after the letter, when CDCR started giving us one phone call every two weeks. It was like having my freedom back everytime I made a phone call to my love ones, and soon after that CDCR gave us a little bit of a program back.</br></br>


We were able to go to yard, but yard for us in isolation its been caged up by ourself for three ours. There is no way of having physical contact with other inmates due to security housing purposes. So all these little changes here in my institution made my life easier all over again.</br></br> 


Even though I am in prison but all these eight years in these cells, one thing that I have learned is to get used to this environment and just expect what we have coming from CDCR rules and regulations. And having little knowledge about COVID 19 it made me to take good care of myself, but it was going so so good until December of 2020. I tested positive for COVID, I really don’t know how I got infected?</br></br>


But I tested positive, I immediately go re-housed to the quarantine building and I was there for three weeks. I remember the only symptoms that I have was a fever for three days, I lost my taste buds and I lost my sense of smell. Thank God it wasn’t bad, I did have concerns about my health but thanks to our lord the infection came and went like nothing.</br></br>


All I did was to put my trust in God and ask for his help and now thanks to him I’m healthy and happy. Its already summer time of 2021. Life is getting back to normal out there on the streets and I’m finally vaccinated. I have both shots for COVID I feel blessed and I’m happy as can be.</br></br>


But as the same time I feel the pain for those that lost a family member, friend or love one due to COVID. My deep condolences goes to them. I know and understand that a few of my words ain’t going to bring their love ones back! And it ain’t goin to make things change.</br></br>


But with these few words I would like for every one of you. You that lost a love one due to this pandemic, you are not alone even though I am in these prison walls and I will be here for the rest of my life. But as a human being I feel your pain, and that on these hard times you can count on me on whatever the case might be, you and your love ones are always in my prayers.</br></br>


So if you need some one to talk to, to feel better even if you are looking for an advice or even if you’re trying to get out from a dard tunnel. You can reach out to me at anytime. May God bless you all.</br></br>


Sincerely.
