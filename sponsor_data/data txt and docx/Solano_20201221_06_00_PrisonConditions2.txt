This story was told by a person incarcerated at Solano.</br></br>UCI: Okay. Okay. And how many people do you think are in the area that testing positive right now? Just kind of a ballpark?</br></br>Caller:	Shit, probably over a hundred.</br></br>UCI: Over a hundred people.</br></br>Caller: Well, it depends on where you go, though. Positive-wise, I think it’s close to 300 now, I say. Different areas altogether probably about 300. Each area probably about 100-somethin apiece.</br></br>UCI: Okay. So, there’s separate areas and each part of the facility then that houses umm...</br></br>Caller: Yea.</br></br>UCI: The uhh positive individuals.</br></br>Caller: Yea pretty much.</br></br>UCI: Okay. And so how does somebody then know if they’ve tested positive? Do they have to have outward symptoms before they for sure know or do they get their test back before they present any symptoms when they’re moved?</br></br>Caller: Naw, it’s basically, they come by and let you know that you tested it and came back positive and you on your way, until you get the proper paperwork. So…</br></br>UCI: Paperwork? What kind of paperwork? Is it a medical release?</br></br>Caller: Medical paperwork, yea, medical paperwork.</br></br>UCI: Medical paperwork. And so are you guys...</br></br>Caller: 	I...I... uhh huh</br></br>UCI: Go ahead, no, no, no, go ahead! I was just gonna ask.</br></br>Caller: Uhh, my thing is just you know, I think, to me if they would’ve isolated people and then just you know instead of moving everybody for exposure, stuff like that, it wouldn’t have spread because when they started movin’ people that’s when stuff spreads.</br></br>

If you keep it dormant and then say if a person does come up positive well then you know if he has symptoms you remove him from the, you know, from the area and then tests everybody again and most likely a lot of people there to test things would have came back negative because when they remove people and put em, they was negative until positive people came around.</br></br> 

So, I think the procedure’s kind of off, you know what I’m sayin, it’s how they do things... it’s uhh... like a custody battle pretty much but.
