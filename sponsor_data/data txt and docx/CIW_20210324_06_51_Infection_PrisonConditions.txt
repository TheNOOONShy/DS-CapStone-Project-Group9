This story was told by a person incarcerated at CIW (California Institution for Women).</br></br>

UCI: And you have access to water though?</br></br> 

Caller: Yeah, I wrote down the date in my little digital things. We have something called like JPay or something. So I wrote down the date there.</br></br> 

But as far as washing our clothes after, COVID we sat over there for two weeks almost dying and we were unable to wash our clothes. Although they had a washing machine available, we were unable to wash our blankets. We had to bring our contaminated blankets back to the same room that were never sprayed or cleaned or anything.</br></br>  

So the air, the air system, it was so thick with lint and garbage on the exhaust vents that I just scraped it and put it up. You know? And sent it somewhere but you know I'm saying?</br></br> 

These are the kind of conditions when they want to say, oh the women are being given bleach. We read one article where the warden was allegedly, the acting warden was allegedly telling people, you know the girls get bleach and they have access to bleach. We've never had bleach since I've been here. Okay not on delta facility so everything that’s being projected, like yeah it sounds good on paper, but it’s not living out.</br></br> 

UCI: Exactly.</br></br> 

Caller: You have the officers that are now taking it serious enough to wear their masks. They were wearing some kind of like little ski thing and it was real flimsy. So then when we see the special on Channel 18 and it showed all the different types of masks and the ones that really work. We were flabbergasted because in essence had, as soon as the 700 inmates broke out then they started issuing us every day masks of N95. So why weren't we given out any?</br></br> 

UCI: Right, at the very beginning.</br></br> 

Caller: Some of us have high risk right, I'm already at a medium risk because I'm out here in Chowchilla with the cocci or whatever they call that thing, valley fever, and I'm a interested party for that, you know.</br></br>  

So when everything comes down, I have to combat that and COVID. You don't wanna give me a mask or you don't wanna give me SaniGuard. And that's where the headaches lie. So now people are doubled up and tripled up in rooms, because now they're doing a transporting thing in order for them to transport inmates to something called CTTRP, community something, training program or something. There are only living four in a room, so what made their lives any better than ours?</br></br> 

UCI: That's crazy.</br></br> 

Caller: This is today.</br></br> 

UCI: That's yeah I was gonna ask about you with the current COVID situation was over there right now.</br></br> 

Caller: Right and today and why they keep saying that, oh CDCR is regulating things that they're doing early releases. These are the people that are being released, but now they're living in a four bedroom cell and we’re cramped up and we still have to be here to catch it. You know?</br></br> 

UCI: Yeah.</br></br> 

Caller: If there's 50 people, send them to the gym.</br></br> 

UCI: Mhm. So is that-</br></br> 

Caller: That’ll be their last stop.</br></br> 

UCI: 'Cause I was gonna say this other there's tents too or they're sending over the gym.</br></br> 

Caller: No, we just have, we, they created an isolation unit, but only if you're positive. So that means that any other living unit will be sequestered. Or, you know, except to the side where you you’re not going to interact with them. We're not worried about the interacting, we're worried about our program.</br></br> 

UCI: Oh, your prog-</br></br> 

Caller: How are they getting four people to a room when we're squashed with eight?
