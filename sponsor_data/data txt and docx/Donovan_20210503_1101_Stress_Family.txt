This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Donovan. </br></br>Now allow me to allow you both to know that you have people under these circumstances that have lost strength, confidence in self, faith, even hope. But a man embraces the reality of his wrong choices in life and strive to never give up yet make better decisions. With that said you wrote to an inmate that has lost hope. </br></br> Therefore, it's allowed me the opportunity to share my mind with some intelligent college brains. </br></br> Yes, everyone has a story. But what I was attracted by in your introduction was how you spoke of knowing we are thought of and to keep strong during this pandemic and life as well. You spoke encouraging words, words of strength. And rather than see your respect for our situation, I refused to see this opportunity passed up. </br></br> My name is [redacted]. Before I get into the effects of the pandemic here, it's a must that I say I describe myself as a diamond in the rough, lol. </br></br>Why do I say this? Because! It's crazy that the many people that knows my family upbringing it's sad how a young man could be raised so beautifully yet made stupidest and selfish acts, time after time. </br></br>But if by God’s graces we have an opportunity to search our thoughts please ask questions and you will see why I am a diamond in the rough. </br></br>Allow me to speak a little concerning the pandemic. As a prisoner this was a total shock because no one understood the power of the disease.
