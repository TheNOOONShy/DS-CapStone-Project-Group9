This story was told by a person incarcerated at Norco.</br></br>UCI: How has the COVID-19 situation affected your loved ones outside? Are you able to talk to them? Or how has that affected?</br></br>Caller: Yeah well, it’s stressful for them, it's stressful. My ex-mother-in-law, she’s 85, she contracted the virus several months ago. She’s in the hospital for about three months, I think. But she made it through, you know, at 85 and so, that’s a good thing.</br></br>A lot of my family’s worried for us, for me. But other than my ex-mother-in-law, I haven't had any family members who’ve actually tested positive. That’s a blessing.
