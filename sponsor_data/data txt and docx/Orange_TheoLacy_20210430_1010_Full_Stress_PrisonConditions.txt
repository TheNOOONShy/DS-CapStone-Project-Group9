Dear PrisonPandemic,</br></br>

I hope and pray when this letter reaches you, you’re in the best of health and in good spirits. I received a letter from one of your students. She informed me that you’re doing a study about how we’re dealing with the pandemic.</br></br>

To be honest this pandemic has challenged my mental endurance. Being incarcerated, we’re already limited to what can have and do. When COVID-19 hit it altered our lives drastically. Most of our rights have been violated in one way or another.</br></br> 

From not being able to show up to court to being stuck in our cells for twenty three and a half hours a day.</br></br>

As far as how we’re being treated, we get three sack lunches a day and they get mad at us when we ask for hot water, so we could cook ourselves a hot meal. A lot of people gained weight due to the unhealthy food they give us. On top of all that not being able to have visitation, losing family and friends and not being able to go to their funerals is stressful.</br></br>

A lot of negative things have happened during this time, but at the end of the day we try and keep a positive attitude. We hope and pray for better days, exercise regularly and keep our trust and faith in God. Thank you for taking the time to reach out to us. It’s not every day we get letters from friends and family let alone strangers.</br></br>
