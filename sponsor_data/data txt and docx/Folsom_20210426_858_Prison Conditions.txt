This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Folsom.</br></br>


This whole pandemic has been a roller coaster ride I would prefer to not ride. This is my eleventh year of incarceration and my first pandemic. The way CDCR and this facility handled it I think needs a lot of work. I was treated as I was a carrier.</br></br>


When in fact the staff is the only ones who can introduce anything into this environment after visiting was shut down. Then everyone was locked down. Tent city went up and infections started. I was locked down until I was infected with COVID.</br></br>


My celly tested positive 10 days before I did, I knew I was next because there is two people sharing 48 square feet of space. It was inevitable. The safety of inmates was in my opinion not a priority. It was trying to save face for the press and not to be forced to release any more people than the minimum requirement.</br></br>


The whole visiting situation really sucks. There is no other word or way to put it. But I understand it even if they didn’t stop it. I would have told my family to stay away.</br></br>


I wouldn’t want to expose them unnecessarily so it is what it is. I call and we talk for now that’s good enough. I’m almost home so we just keep moving forward. I have dealt with this fine.</br></br>


I’m a pretty resilient person that’s a trait you learn in this environment. I’m just looking for it to be done and over. A lot of people are hesitant to get vaccinated. But anyone who wants the vaccine can get it.</br></br>


Even though I’ve had COVID I got the shot. I wasn’t going to but my family pushed me to it. I lost my grandfather December 2020 from COVID so I didn’t argue.</br></br>
