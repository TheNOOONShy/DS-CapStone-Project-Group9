This story was told by a person incarcerated at John Latorraca Correctional Center.</br></br>

UCI: I see. Okay. Well, is there - is there anything else you want anyone to know about your experience inside at this time?</br></br>

Caller: Well, I mean just that I don't - I don't want to – things, really, in - in CDC and - and in the County jails right now are not getting handled the way they should be – you know what I'm saying? As far as like keeping COVID patients segregated from the rest of the population, keeping – you know what I'm saying – guards – you know what I'm saying – that - that don't have vaccines, that don't have the masks. You know what I'm saying?</br></br>

Like it's just – I don't know. The - the way things are getting - getting handled, it's like that's why so many inmates are getting sick right now. And, especially, in CDC, so many are dying.</br></br>

UCI: Right. And you said your fiancée is at Chowchilla. Correct?</br></br>

Caller: Yes. My fiancée is at Chowchilla. And - and she writes me about that. Now, she - she caught COVID-19 herself. And she - she was really sick.</br></br>

UCI: And was she vaccinated?</br></br>

Caller: I don't believe so. But she's vaccinated now. She wrote me and said she got vaccinated now.</br></br>

UCI: Okay. That's good for her.</br></br>

Caller: But they gave, again they gave - they gave her the Moderna, she said. And so they gave her the first dose. I don't know if she got a booster shot. But I know - I know, after she got COVID, they gave her a shot – the first shot.</br></br>

But I don't know if she got the second one. But she said that a lot of girls in her - in her building and in her cell – they're in six-woman cells over there, she said – they all caught it. And - and she told me it was from the guards. Because there was no new arrivals.</br></br>

There was no new inmates coming in. Because, for a long time, CDC stopped receiving new inmates because of COVID. Okay? So inmates were getting infected by the guards. But, now, CDC opened up the reception centers again – Chowchilla, for the women's.</br></br>

Delano is a men's reception center. Tri City is a men's reception center. San Quentin is a men's reception center. Since they opened these reception centers again, people from County with COVID are going back in the prison system.</br></br>

So, now, a lot more prison inmates are getting infected again. Because it's not just the guards bringing it in but it's other inmates.</br></br>

UCI: Do you know at what point of time they stopped letting, I guess, transfers occur?</br></br>

Caller: You know, I know that they just started doing transfers again. They started allowing it about two months ago. But, for – I know, for the women's facility, they stopped - they stopped taking in - in new inmates for over a year. And they just stopped - they just picked it up again like two months ago.</br></br>

UCI: Oh. So inmates-</br></br>

Caller: But, the - the men's - the men's CDC – Delano – because Delano's our reception center, right here. Delano - Delano's been receiving inmates for a couple months right now. But they - they - they stopped, too, for about a year, I would say.</br></br>

UCI: Okay. So, according to your fiancée and her cellmates, it seems that all the cases are coming from guards. Because there weren't any transfers up until two months ago.</br></br>

Caller: Yes. Yeah. That's what she - that's what she told me in a letter she wrote me. So she said - she said the guards were bringing it into the women's facility.
