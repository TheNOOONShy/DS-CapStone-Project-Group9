This story was told by a person incarcerated at Los Angeles County Men’s Central Jail.</br></br>

Caller: I mean, at the onset of this, we'd literally set up and like – and it'd sound like a coughing concert in here. It was people coughing, choking, throwing up. You can hear them moaning and gr- just literally seem like it was a hospital.</br></br>

But - but, like I say, they - the deputies come through here, half of them had they mask on halfway still. And the food they pass out has been managed by inmates who's constantly on quarantine because of COVID. The - the sanitation and dealing with our food and showers and everything else is so - so foul.</br></br>

Some people, they just don't even take part in it. If it hadn't been for family and loved ones, I probably would've starved to death in here, simply because of the food management and, you know, it just break – like they push the food through shower water. And milk crates that's on paper plates that's not covered properly.</br></br>

And you get your plate and there's dust and trash and, you know, bugs and stuff are on it. I mean it's - it's horrible. You got the trustees that's - that's passing out the food.</br></br>

They don't have a mask, hairnet. Sometimes, they don't even have on gloves. Sometimes, they'll drop the food on the floor, pick it up, and put it right – and this is in front of you.</br></br>

So it's – it's - not to mention what it goes through be- you know,you know during the time that it takes to get to us. And that's just some of the problems. The shower is always backing up, where we're standing in – if you go take a shower, it's a stall of, I believe, eight to ten stalls connected.</br></br>

And the shower drainage gets stopped up all the time. And it's just – and I'm talking about for at least years that the shower drain – the water comes up to at least your ankles. We literally have to turn the water off and let the water seep down while we standing in there.</br></br>

And the steam and everybody coughing and choking and sneezing and everything, like they're – so it's – it's - to me, it's a hazard. Especially, in these times of COVID.</br></br>

UCI: Right. And has this been happening before COVID and just gotten worse during COVID or did this kind of happen at the onset of COVID – that you're seeing these poor sanitation practices?</br></br>

Caller: Well, it's – it's some of them been happening prior to COVID and but they haven't been changed in light of COVID. And some - some of it took part during COVID. I don't know if it was a result of the pandemic.</br></br>

But - but, the problem is, is that these are - these are situations that could easily be remedied if someone actually just, you know, oversee them and tell them, "Hey, you'd - you'd do a lot better if you just do right." But we have deputies just sit here and watch TV all day. And they don't do nothing. We literally just sit here and suffer.
