To the PrisonPandemic Project,</br></br>
Greetings friend,</br></br>As you already know, I am currently at San Quentin. I thank you for contacting me and filling me in on what your company is all about.</br></br> 

However, can you fill me in on when your organization came to life, and who referred you to me? I’ve enclosed a piece along with this note, I hope that it’s worth your time. May God continue to bless all your righteous deeds.</br></br> Operation: Spit Fire on Corruption</br></br>                                                                                                                                                       December 2020</br></br>
Dear Fighters Against Corruption,</br></br> 
        It is my strong opinion that the California Department of Corrections and its administrative heads are now delusional and in need of psychiatric care. For sound-minded individuals whose mission for taxpayers is to rehabilitate the criminal mindset of the convicted, has taken a turn for the worst.</br></br> 

Yet, instead of admitting their need of psychiatric care, their accumulation of pride has driven them to vacate the system of justice and rehabilitation, and in some cases, become individuals who perpetuate crime, thus becoming perpetrators of crime to so-call extinguish crime.</br></br> 

With that, I am not here to minimize the wrongs I’ve committed in life. Yet in today’s justice system, if one commits a crime, they do the time or pay the price of their wrongs. Justice is not bias, criminals in high places are (Ephesians 6:12 of the Bible).</br></br>
For the past year, CDCR has shown society’s incarcerated citizens (and their families) that they are unable to rehabilitate or properly provide for its incarcerated population, from the food they serve, lack of supplies, to their delayed medical and dental service.</br></br> 

As I write this letter, I am on hold for the dentist. After two months of waiting to see the dentist for the constant pain in my tooth, I was finally seen by the dentist who told me that I had two choices: to pull my tooth (which doesn’t need pulling), or wait until COVID is over to get the filling my tooth needs. For drills and other dental equipment was not being used during the COVID pandemic.</br></br> 

Although I’ve recently been given Ibuprofen and Tylenol to help fight against the pain, it returns with vengeance several times, hours later, demanding me to mask its kick with the prescribed medication.</br></br>
 This failure to provide proper dental care, along with many other failures on behalf of CDCR, is all the more reason for the DOC to start closing the doors to their many prisons in California where no current rehabilitating is taking place, for all the schools, vocational classes, religious services, and programs are all closed.</br></br> 

In contrast, I understand that there are good employees inside California prisons, but what help is being offered to California taxpayers when that chance to express that good is being suppressed under covert knowledge of their coworkers’ evil deeds to perpetuate crime for the sake of keeping a steady flow of residual income, classic old school “Hear no evil, see no evil.” To know of their evils and not report it is a crime within itself as an upholder of the law.</br></br> 
Therefore, as I close, with the presence of indirect of direct bullying within the CA DOC organization, covert crime will continue to perpetuate itself at the cost of unsuspecting taxpayers’ dollars if CDCR’s administration team isn’t carefully evaluated by psychiatric doctors.</br></br> 

To know of this evil practice of committing crimes against the convicted, and not speak out against, or ask for transparency as to where or what your tax dollars are being spent on, is to put on the same dirty gloves of the criminals in power or in high places.</br></br> 

So, I urge you (concerned ones) to follow your money if you have the know-how and means to do so. Where there is a will, there is a way.</br></br>

Peace,</br></br> GOD.IS.LOVE
