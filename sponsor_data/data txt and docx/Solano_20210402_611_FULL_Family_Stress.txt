This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Solano.</br></br>Hello PrisonPandemic,</br></br>First and foremost, I would personally want to thank you for taking some time to hit me up. That really means a lot to me, especially during my journey towards either life or death. My life has been given a rare twist on its own without any tactical moves from me.</br></br>I been locked up for four years now on a three strike sentence of 35 years to life for assault with deadly weapon penal code 245(a)(1). Since the third strike has to be violent or serious felony under California state law, a 25 years to life is the deal on trial by jury. I took my case to jury and lost.</br></br>Since 2017, I have had a enlighten awakening because my life was over, at least until recently. I can give you a detail description based on a true story.</br></br>Now since this whole COVID-19 shit happen about a year ago, another personal transition occurred to me. I have followed international news along with national news. For the good or worse possible, I stay completely aware.</br></br>Since this global pandemic really got fucken' serious in my life because my only sister, a respiratory therapist, working in the medical field had got exposed to COVID-19 back in August 2020. This really scared the crap outta me for back in 2014 I had lost my other sister. A three tour Iraq veteran, to a man who was related to my sister’s finance, cousin.</br></br>I felt the same but worse because my sister whom I truly love was only 30 years old last summer. She quarantined herself and COVID-19 did not take her away.</br></br>As for here at Solano in the beginning, the correctional staff did not want to say anything. Then when the Governor Newsom announced lock down procedures, which includes all correctional institution, the ordeal got real. The correctional staff then started to feel the anxiety as well, telling us the truth about this global pandemic.</br></br>Everyone was aware of what was going on at San Quentin State Prison but since that prison houses PC or protective custody inmates. We overall did not have any sympathy for the deaths of COVID-19 at that joint. For us they are seen as trash because they have sex offenders, gays, drop outs, and snitches.</br></br>So everyone was like “fuck them fucking PC’s they deserve to die.” Over here in GP or general population, we do not allow such individuals among us. I think that is why Correctional Supervisory did not move them out of SQSP, among of their factors.</br></br>Slowly, our nights have been diluted because of COVID-19. No one gets to participate in any rehabilitation program. Some of us want to acquire or achieve as much possible to show BPH (Board of Prison Hearings) that we are changing and deserve a chance in society once again.</br></br>I will end this for now. Hopefully you can write me back. If you do want more info on details, I’m willing to provide and open up much more. Thank you once again.</br></br>Respectfully submitted.
