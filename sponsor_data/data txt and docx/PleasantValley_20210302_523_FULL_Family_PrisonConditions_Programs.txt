This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Pleasant Valley.</br></br>Dear PrisonPandemic,</br></br> First and foremost, I hope all of you are in the best of health and in high spirits. I also want to thank all of you for caring and giving your support, especially in these difficult times, thank you.</br></br>The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted us by not allowing us to continue with self-help groups, vocations, or education. Just recently they’ve started to give us a few programs, but we’re still very limited on the programs we can attend, so we can’t earn many milestones.</br></br>Not being able to see our family in person and give them a hug has been rough on all of us. It’s bad enough that we can’t see them in person, I don’t want to sound ungrateful, but a half-hour video visit, once a month is not cool.</br></br>Yard is only three hours every other day, the rest of the time we’re locked in our cell as if we’re being punished. Medical is not seeing anyone unless it’s an emergency.</br></br>I hope this helps with your project. I wasn’t sure exactly of what type of information you’re wanting. It’s good to know that there’s people out there who care. I highly appreciate everything you guys are doing.
