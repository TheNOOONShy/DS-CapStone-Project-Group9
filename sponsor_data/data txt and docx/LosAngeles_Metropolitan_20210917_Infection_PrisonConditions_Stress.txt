At the same time I was in a United States Penitentiary in Atwater Ca, by Fresno. The first case of COVID landed about ten minutes from the joint I was at. We seen it on tv but for sure I didn’t take it serious. I was consumed with my sports, March Madness, and Kobe had just died.</br></br>

I used to drink really heavily and I had quit in 2017. I was making moonshine and it blew up on me, so I got burnt really bad.</br></br> 

I went to the hospital for almost two months received skin grafts on my chest, back, arms, shoulders. The plastic surgeon fixed my face, you can’t really see any scars. And I didn’t lose my tattoos.</br></br> 

But I’m on Suboxone. So when we seen it on tv we paid it no mind. We got locked down, and I get so sick headache, fevers, bones, etc. I thought I was gonna die.</br></br> 

I never once thought COVID, three days later it was gone. The whole prison got sick. Then, they locked us down.</br></br> 

About six months later I developed a heart condition. I thought I was having a heart attack. Now let me tell you I’m in great shape. I don’t eat junk or fat and work out hard.</br></br> 

Then, I read an article in "Wall Street Journal" about a COVID study in Germany with patients over 40. I think over 70 percent developed heart problems.</br></br> 

Then we had another outbreak in November. I caught it again. That’s when I knew for sure I had it.</br></br> 

This was only one day, and I had a fever and a headache. I did not notice the virus had behaved the not only gave it to us but failed to protect us or even help us.</br></br> 

I go home in 60 days. I’m so glad you care enough to reach out. I can draw. I will send you some copies. I draw for money so it will have to be copies.</br></br> 

I would love to help you in any way I can and answer all questions you might have. Once, I’m released it will be easier to politics ya get me?</br></br>

I have a lot of insight. I’ve read a lot about it plus I have seen it first hand. I’m a Trump supporter and so I seen how the news used fear to pump it up.</br></br>

The masks are a joke and I also seen how fear made people sick. China played a major role in unleashing this bio weapon on us. I encourage you to trust in God. And I don’t take the vaccine.</br></br>
