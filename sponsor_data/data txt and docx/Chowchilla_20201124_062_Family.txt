3. What has it been like to have reduced visitations from family and loved ones?</br></br> Terrible, basically that by far was a blessing because I could spend some time with family and/or friends, eat some decent food, and feel like a human being again at least for a little while. Find out what's really happening out there in the “real world”. We don't have “reduced visitation”, we have “no visitation” for a very long time.</br></br> 

Now and every time my family and friends call up here and ask the question “when will visiting start again?” they're told “no, not this time, please keep on checking.” That's the answer that no one us want to hear.
