This letter was written by a person incarcerated at High Desert.</br></br> 

Time in here during COVID has been very stressful. You never know who the virus will hit. Good thing that we are very fortunate and are provided with jpay tablets to send messages to our loved ones. I have lost family members prior to this virus.</br></br> 

I cope a little different than others I have met. I took two psychology courses a few years back to understand myself better and to understand others as well. I read that no story is too small. Well I do not have stories, only facts about my progress and how proud I am of it.</br></br> 

If you are interested in getting to know about it, or know of anyone who might be, go to jpay and use my CDC number along with my last name and subscribe to be able to email me. And we can correspond more often on frequent occasions. I have been looking for novice paralegals who may provide me with some legal advice on how to go about a pending case I have.</br></br>

I can send my art work as an exchange, and also provide how difficult these times are for us and our families. For now, let me answer your questions and give you a run down on my experience as an unfortunate immigrant. Who feels like he doesn't belong here (US) no there (Mexico).</br></br>

Doing time during this pandemic has not been easy. But like I mentioned earlier, we have tablets and an email to anyone who subscribed to the app. I watch TV around 15 percent of my day. I spend the rest studying, reading, writing, drawing or working out. I feel safe and secure.</br></br>

I take good care of myself and have great hygiene. My mask stays on every time I exit my cell and I avoid shaking hands.</br></br>

Visits have been reduced to family only being able to see us on video. I have not seen my family since 2010 so it doesn't really affect me as much. I have become somewhat stoic when it comes to how I feel about my children not knowing who I am. Another day-</br></br> 

We have to remind ourselves that it is no ones fault for any mishap that may have occurred to us on a personal level. My business is mine to handle. I don't see myself throwing my problems on someone who has not earned my trust to open up to.</br></br>

What I can share with you is a timeline of my struggles as an immigrant, and what I am doing (or trying to do) to get myself to stay in the US, for I’m a stranger in my birth country.</br></br> 

I can also share stories that do not involve any criminal activity or anything of that nature. I believe that progress and the overcoming of obstacles creating the struggles are more important to hear about.</br></br> 

This prevent unnecessary exposure, and misleading those who have not had a difficult life is on my agenda never. Well I hope I have made it clear enough that I don’t have the need to celebrate anything negative or promote stereotypes of a prisoner. Chance and destiny linked us together and now it's on you to take advantage.</br></br> 

If not, then pass my information to someone who may see the potential to capitalize, even if the gain is intangible. We can begin with Plato’s Allegory of the Cave. Thank you for your time and interest.</br></br> 

Sincerely.
