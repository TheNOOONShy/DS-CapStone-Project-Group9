This story was told by a person incarcerated at Vacaville.</br></br>

UCI: Yes. What has the COVID situation been like?</br></br>

Caller: The COVID situation?</br></br>

UCI: Yes.</br></br>

Caller: It’s been kind of rough. You know, you have to try to keep yourself in good health and keep yourself clean and stay away from other people and try not to catch the COVID-19. If you do catch it, you’re supposed to report it to staff so they can get you some help.</br></br>

Right now, I have. I’m high risk on the list for COVID-19 and I’m doing everything that I can do to not catch the COVID-19.</br></br>

UCI: Definitely. Do you think they have given you the resources where you can do your best to stay COVID-free?</br></br>

Caller: Yes. I’m trying to right now. I’m trying to stay COVID-free by staying by myself and I’m in a closed living environment but it’s kind of difficult to stay away from all the people. But you have to be cautious about the things that you do and how you do it. And how you take care of yourself around here. Cause it’s easy to catch it.
