This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Solano.</br></br>

There never has been a mandatory testing for- of staff to my knowledge and for those randomly selected, were done several weeks apart. Temperature readings was done on a semi-regular basis for staff but as I will speak about later, it does not actually register when someone is infected. The most often used information to determine if staff would be allowed onto prison arounds; be it free staff or correctional, was self-reporting. If a staff did not self-report feeling sick, it went unnoticed until long after they were allowed to enter prison grounds and infect prison inmates.</br></br> 

Furthermore, staff were allowed to work inside different buildings and medical staff too which mean they contaminated multiple buildings.</br></br>
 
Inmates at Solano prison were isolated and safe from COVID-19 so long as all transfers of inmates from prison to prison stopped and staff testing was held at a high standard. In both cases the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, Solano State Prison, and Solano health care staff failed miserably resulting in unnecessary loss of life and the deliberate infection of mass inmates.</br></br>
 
Sometime around October or November of 2020, Solano prison received several inmates from San Quentin and Folsom prisons. Those inmates were as medical staff put it, "resolved cases." Initially a directive was issued stating any inmate arriving at the institution shall be quarantined for 14 days and tested. However, when the bus from Folsom arrived, it contained inmates who contracted COVID while at Folsom, were isolated and eventually released back into general population.</br></br> 

And several who did not test positive but were sent here due to being high risk.</br></br>
 
Inmates were mixed and contaminated on that bus. This fact is made worse due to correctional transportation staff touched every inmate placing waist chains and leg chain. Furthermore, these same staff are touching the inmates lunches and stopped at gas station or delis to purchase gas and food. Without ever maintaining proper COVID cleaning regiments.</br></br> 

This cross contamination was detrimental to the health and welfare of every inmate and staff at Solano prison because it was short after that Solano prison received its first case of COVID-19.</br></br>
 
Inmates who test possible were sent directly into mainline while the remaining inmates were placed into quarantine. One such Folsom "resolved" inmate were placed on the bunk next to mine. I have to admit that I was very suspicious and fearful. I believed I was lied to by staff who were trying to minimize this persons threat my health.</br></br> 

I was so scared that I slept with a cloth mask every night, something that is both dangerous and unhealthy.
