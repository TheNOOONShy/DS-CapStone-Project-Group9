This story was told by a person incarcerated at SATF (California Substance Abuse Treatment and State Prison).</br></br>

Inmates from my yard, level three, had to go to the central kitchen and take their assigned job and cook for all the yard at this facility. My cellmate was one of these people going over to a level four yard and do the work.</br></br>

He was so afraid of catching the virus where many inmates from that yard had just come out positive a few weeks before. Little by little, inmates from my level three yard started to give positive COVID tests.
