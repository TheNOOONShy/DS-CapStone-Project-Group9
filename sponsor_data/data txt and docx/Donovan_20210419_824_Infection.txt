This story was told by a person incarcerated at Donovan.</br></br>

UCI: Ok and how has that- how has the vaccination situation been like for you guys?</br></br>

Caller: Right so the- I think I wrote a little bit about that too, here somewhere. Ok so initially it came around- they came around asking or telling the- the priority inmates. Probably like the older inmates, I’m 38 so they were asking what like- 60 and older. People that were like- with mental conditions and all that “Would you like a vaccination?” and I’m going to say like, hypothetically, 10% of them chose to get it.</br></br>

And then after that round of people that got vaccinated right, with the first shot of Pfizer, I’m going to say about like, a month or so later they moved out to the next group of people which was like. I think like 40-50 year olds or whatever or people that have asthma, heart problems and all that kind of stuff. And then on the final stage, that’s where I came in.</br></br>

The remaining people were like- asked if they want to take the vaccination. Not everyone has tooken it and so, you know there’s still the question about- you know. How our contact visits are going to run. And as a matter of fact, today- on this day- the Prison Administration chose to go back down to what’s called “Phase One” and until about two or three positive cases of- of staff- I think it was staff.</br></br>

I’m not sure. It could’ve been inmates and so they- they went back on alert, you can say, right. They- they’re limiting the- the program again. We’re- we can only interact with our own building wherever we’re out.</br></br>

UCI: Ok ok and so how- how do you feel about, say the- the- what is it called? The guards coming in with the, you know, bringing in the COVID or with the-</br></br>

Caller: *talks over* well you know the- you know I got you on- issues, comments. Issues and questions among inmates and you know, people talking and all that, we feel- I feel personally that there should have been more control, in that area right? And obviously we always said here, us inmates, we can- we’re not going- we catch this stuff is by the guards bringing it in. Right, the contaminated cases or whatever they said.</br></br>

So here’s the- the very good example, right? I’m going to say in the beginning- no. Around, November last year? They had what’s called free staff, right. Free staff are like people that do like maintenance work, run factories like a shoe factory- launch-warehouse- whatever.</br></br>

They chose to come in, contaminate it without no- making a proper notification and what happened there is. They chose- they didn’t earn their- their salary and. And as a result, they created a spread, you know what I mean? So one facility, which is CR, got shut down completely because of that. So it wasn’t handled right. It wasn’t being monitored properly.
