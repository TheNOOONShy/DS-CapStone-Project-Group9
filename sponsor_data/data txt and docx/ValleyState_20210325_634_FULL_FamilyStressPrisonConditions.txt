Dear PrisonPandemic,</br></br>

Hey, I'll write this letter only if I receive more info about PrisonPandemic project. So I'll tell you a little about myself. I'm engaged to a beautiful woman who is the mother of my beautiful little girl. I'm in my mid-30s and have but a year or less till my release. I've been incarcerated since March 2019 and will be released April 2021.</br></br> 

Okay, I hope you are in great health and the rest of the students- many blessings.</br></br>

Answering your questions. One, what has it been like to be inside during this time? No complaints. I'm alive and paying for the crime I committed. Yes COVID-19 has affected us all, but I'm in here for a reason. Two, how do I feel about my safety inside? Well I am a high-risk medical who, if I could go to a doctor on my own, I would.</br></br> 

As far as my safety goes, CDCR has taken every right precaution that they can. I mean we're prison inmates, what can I do? Let us all out? Yes, I feel safe.</br></br>

Three, What has it been like to have reduced visitation from family and loved ones? It sucks only because being away from my princess and my fiance is like a spider without a web. I can only survive but I need something to hold onto. I mean why survive when we can live!</br></br> 

My family is my web. We're eternally blessed. But overall, speaking with my family is the best thing ever. I also have a son, I've never met him but I pray to God everyday that he's great and his mother, too. He's 11 years old.</br></br> 

Four, how have I been coping with this crisis? I've been coping with this crisis by binge-watching Big Bang Theory and Modern Family, LOL. Laughter is good for the body, mind, and soul.</br></br>

Five, how have the vaccinations been going at my facility? Funny you should ask, I'm receiving mine today or tomorrow. I want to say about 80 percent of the inmates are vaccinated. So Valley State Prison is also bringing in tablets which are free provided by GTL - a phone company.</br></br> 

We will be allowed video family visits. I meant to write this down earlier. Thank you so much for your care and concern.</br></br>

Sincerely.
