This story was told by a person incarcerated at Chuckawalla.</br></br>

Caller: When they try to quarantine you, you get quarantined with other people that are sick, and you get quarantined, you're - everything shuts down.</br></br>

There’s no school. There’s no - there’s no chapel. There’s nothing. All they give us is food, and you know, a minimum, a little bit of yard.</br></br>

So you’re in here with over about 250 inmates in one little small building, and they’re trying to say social distancing and all that stuff, but it’s not. There’s no social distancing whatsoever.</br></br>

And I understand that they’ve been trying to provide us with masks and stuff, but, yeah, you’re trying to provide us with masks, but you’re not even providing us with social distancing. When it’s by law that we have to be a certain amount of distance from everybody. From, you know, by law, now, you know?</br></br> 

Basically, to follow the law and right now we’re breaking the law, the whole prison is breaking the law, you know? The way I see it.</br></br>

But nobody’s gonna say anything or do anything about it 'cause the CDC was somehow trying to overlook it or think of some kind of different way of explaining, "Well, we can’t do this because we got no bedrooms," or whatever. But it’s not, it’s not our issue. The issue is that the CDC is breaking their law, you know, of social distancing and taking away from us, and making us go through it by taking away our - our rights to go and pray in the chapel.</br></br>

Okay, well, and they’re putting, they’re putting inmates inside the chapel. They’re putting inmates in classrooms to quarantine these people that are sick, and that came up positive, and then expecting us to go back into those classrooms, and these chapels to, to have services or to have a program for education. So I don’t understand how that’s supposed to work, you know? I mean, all they’re doing is spreading it all over the facility when you do that, you know?</br></br>

And I don’t, I don’t see how they don’t go — get down on their, their staff here, you know? More - they need to up the, up the safety concerns with the staff coming here, ‘cause that’s the only way we’re getting it, is through the staff bringing it from the outside coming in. It’s not us, we can’t just get it out of the air, you know? So, so that’s another thing.
