This letter was written by a person incarcerated at High Desert.</br></br>

I got your letter saying you wanted a story about inside of prison. Well, first off it's hell and lonely. Nothing good comes out of it, only the fact that you learn your lesson and become a better person and not mess up again. There's violent things that go on like stabbings and murder but you have to be smart. There's a lot of politics that go on with different races. Everyone is grouped up.</br></br> 

I am trying to change. I do bible studies and pray to god to get through the day. I try to stay away from bad things even though it's all around. There needs to be a lot of change in here. I am willing to do this and tell all. I used to be in a gang in LA doing the usual gang stuff. I've changed now and grew out of that even though I have my hard times. I try to stay clean off drugs even though it's hard.</br></br> 

I take it day by day. There's really not much to do here but think about your mistakes and go to school for those who haven't graduated and willing to go take classes. Sorry for my grammar and spelling and writing. I am not good on writing at all, though I try to spent my time looking for penpals to write even though some come and go.</br></br> 

Other than that, there's is so little to do. We get dayroom certain times of the day. Right now we are on a lockdown with the whole COVID crisis. I don't know when we will be off and go back to normal program.</br></br> 

Other than that, our living is not good. Very small cells, two per cell unless you're a single cell inmate. There are dorm living, but I don't like that, too noisy. I rather live in a two-man cell, someone to talk to and not go completely crazy. We also get yard time, certain time of the days and for those who really get in trouble in here will get write-ups when they lose privileges like going to store and dayroom and yard time. Maybe they can lose phone time also.</br></br>

We also can order four packages from an online company that is part of the prison with lots of stuff to order from. Other than that, there's really nothing else to say.
