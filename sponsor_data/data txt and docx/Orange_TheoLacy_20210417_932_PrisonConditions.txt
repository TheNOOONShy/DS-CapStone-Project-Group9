Jail is not what it used to be 6 years ago. It was never this bad. For one these is no social distancing no matter what they say. The swab tests they do are completely optional, so whoever is sick denies the tests, because they are housed somewhere or with someone they are already comfortable with, and they don't want to be moved to a quarantine mod.</br></br>They give out these high-powered meds now to keep everyone sedated pretty much, I guess you can say. For example, literally if you ask a nurse to be put on suboxone or Subutex they will just give it to you two times a day during normal pill call times. If you say you have anxiety, they give you Xanax, stuff like that. It's like if they want us all tired and out of it that way we're not needy.</br></br>I don't know but yeah. Never in my life I would have thought jail would be like this. They pretty much are letting inmates get high with pharmacy meds. People cheek their pills, sell them off to other people for items like toilet paper, soap, soups, milk, etc. I myself do not use drugs so all this is a horrible experience. It's like a mental institute in here with a bunch of college kid deputies who antagonize people who aren't mentally there in the head.
