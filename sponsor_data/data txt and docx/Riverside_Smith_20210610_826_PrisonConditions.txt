UCI: And what has the COVID situation been like at your facility?</br></br>

Caller: It's bad because they got too many people in here and they're not cleaning up. We use one thing that we clean with. They spray it on the tables or the phones, just one solution, and they don't use bleach or disinfectant. They leave it to us.</br></br> 

And when I go to court they pack us in there like sardines. Every seat has to be filled, to be three to a seat, and it's not six feet apart. I have to get my stuff, hold on. Hello?</br></br>

UCI: Hello.</br></br>

Caller: Hello?</br></br>

UCI: Hello.</br></br>

Caller: Hello, yes.</br></br>

UCI: Hi.</br></br>

Caller: Okay, and when you're on the bus it's horrible. It's, like, there's no separation. I'd say about two feet apart, if that. And then, there's this holding cells to hold you for court, they don't have anybody in there, the court, to see you or talk to you but they want to pack you in there like about, I'm going to say, it's supposed to be three people in there but they put 10 people in the cell.</br></br> 

And nobody's six feet apart, they don't have masks available. All the masks that they have are dirty, are nasty. This is how it is at the jail I'm at now, at Banning Road Camp.</br></br>

UCI: Is that the Larry D. Smith Correctional?</br></br>

Caller: Yes, that's it.
