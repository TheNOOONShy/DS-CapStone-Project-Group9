This story was told by a person incarcerated at Colusa County Jail.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, definitely. Yeah, and I mean, for me, you know, from a personal experience you know, my father was - is also someone who I look up to and, you know. I also see him as my guardian angel as well and, you know, I can only imagine what you’re going through, like I said, and again I’m really sorry for your loss. But, have you, have you been trying to do anything else?</br></br>

Like, to try to keep your mind busy? Like anything, like maybe working out or like reading?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah.</br></br>

UCI: Anything? Mm-hmm.</br></br> 

Caller: I - well I used to work out like every day, and then like when I was told that it just like - I stopped working out so.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>

Caller: I’m just now getting back into working out again. I do like, 400 squats a day.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br> 

Caller: A thousand push ups a day and we do a little bit of bar work and I’m going to school too. So like, every six weeks that I go to school, they take seven days off my sentence so.</br></br>

UCI: Oh, okay nice.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah that’s another thing that’s keeping me busy.</br></br> 

UCI: Yeah.</br></br> 

Caller: I got a bunch of homework I gotta do and stuff like that.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm. Nice man, well I, you know, I just want to say I’m, I’m proud of you man. You know, keep going hard at that, at your school and you know eventually it's all going to pay off man. And I know it will for you, and you know I’m, I’m also very glad that - to hear that you also started working out again.</br></br>

A thousand push ups is crazy. I can barely do like 50.</br></br>

So, that’s, that’s awesome of you man. And 400 squats keep - it’s good to keep the mind busy and the body, body healthy. So definitely keep doing that. Keep doing what you’re doing! Make sure you’re drinking enough - lots of water too if you have access to that definitely.</br></br> 

Caller: Yeah.</br></br>

UCI: You know, you want to stay hydrated and you know, keep your body up to shape as well.</br></br> 

Caller: Okay, yeah.</br></br> 

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br> 

Caller: I do.
