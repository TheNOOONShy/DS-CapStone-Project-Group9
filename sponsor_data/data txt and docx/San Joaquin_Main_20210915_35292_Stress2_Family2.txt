Caller: I want to do so well for my children [unintelligible] be better. I just have to slow down a – a bit and focus on the big picture and take it [unintelligible] there has been far too many days in the last year where I'd come home a bit late, too late from work or a date, perhaps, and the kids are already asleep, and my daughter has already fed everybody and got [unintelligible] but my heart just sinks.</br></br>

I know I can do so much better. I just have to stay focused and not get distracted in a world where everything is one big diversion pulling me away from what I cherish the most. That's why I needed to find just that one right woman for me for the benefit of both me and my family allowing me to stay focused and channel all my efforts one way back towards the family – my family the way it's always been. But in light of what's happening – I'm sorry.</br></br>

But in light of what's happened recently with me pulling away from two unhealthy relationships in a row with women that would rather be on drugs instead of being a family, and I'll tell you right now, I don't do drugs, I'll never do drugs again in my life, and I don't want – and I don't and won't properly associate with anyone who does. I did try using drugs for a few months during the last year of my life, and it was a horrible experience. I've never felt worse and I'll never do it again. Such a waste of time.</br></br>

And, of course, the worst possible diversion for me taking care of my [unintelligible] and that just made me [unintelligible] so now in a way been left actually being a little bit bitter and [unintelligible] with the – the whole concept [unintelligible] people choose by way of doing drugs, it has all made me a bit angry, actually, and I don't wish [unintelligible] of hate inside me, but that – that [unintelligible] touched me in the worst way leaving me [unintelligible] that I let it happen because I grew up in that world.</br></br>

And I'm not naïve. I've always known better. So with that and coming out of a total of 22 years straight of being in a constant relationship between these two women, and now being single for the first time in my entire adult life, enough said; right? I could probably just stop there.
