This story was told by a person incarcerated at Los Angeles County Men's Central Jail.</br></br>

UCI: Oh. I was going to say – I was like so how has it affected, like, seeing your loved ones? Like, are you allowed visitation rights or are you, like, just letters or phone calls?</br></br>

Caller: I don't - I don't really – I'm not really the visit guy. I just talk on the phone. I'm not too like curt. Like I talk to my kids on the phone like two, three times a week. You know? My mom – that's about it. I don’t talk to nobody else.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: You know? I don't - everybody's over it. Everybody's over it. It's like I'm over it. Like, damn. No. I was like, "Are you done yet? Are you done yet?" "I don't know.”</br></br>

UCI: Yeah. Well, at least, you have your like your daughter.</br></br>

Caller: I do. I try to. But-</br></br>

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: But I-</br></br>

UCI: I said, at least, you still have like your daughter to talk to and just like see what she's up to.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, yeah. It's - it's really a blessing to have. You know? Like my girls never gave me any problems, nothing.</br></br>

They weren't the party- "Oh, I want to go party and weekend." They weren't that type. They were – rather study. You know?</br></br>

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: But I instilled that in them since they were little.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: Since they were little, I told them, "You know, the chiquitas.” So, after they were like third, fourth grade, they did it on their own.
