UCI: What about not able to see your family and loved ones?</br></br>Caller: Yeah, no. That's not, that's restricted to phone calls only. I don't want my family to come here anyways even if the restrictions were lifted and I told my family that I wouldn't want to see them because there's people coming from different cities from all over. And the probability of her catching COVID from somebody just to come see me would be really high. So, for me it's not worth the risk.
