This story was told by a person incarcerated at Fresno County Main Jail. 

Caller 2: As far as the vaccination, they came through here with one shot, and they ain't been back since. They publicize it on a TV that they was given us, [unintelligible] whatever it is, to be healthy. They haven't came back for the second shot in I don't know how long. The last date that they came was about a month ago. They haven't came back for that.</br></br>

Social distancing? There's none. They're not pushing policy on social distancing. They're just leaving us in here just to run wild, ma'am. This is a psych tank, don't forget to mention. I wish I can tell you my name; that's why you can look me up and see what I'm talking about. I'm one of the people that got sense. I'm the one that holds down this pod out of 43 people to make sure that everything is cool and collected.</br></br>

As far as my job, I'm making sure they're washing their hands and cleaning up after themselves. This man just left from here about 48 hours ago. They blamed the COVID on a fever. The man was so vicious. He looked like he got in a fight but ma'am, there was no fight. It's filthy in here, ma'am.</br></br>

UCI: Hm-mmm.</br></br>

Caller 2: It's filthy. Ain't no social distancing. Ain't any proper guidance of the penal code that they're supposed to be abiding by. I spoke to a woman in here before too who told me not to give up my name and, if we had any questions, to write. But it's starting to get beside ourself. I think the news needs to be involved in this. I talked to my wife already. You all need to look into this, ma'am, like honest truth.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, that's the purpose of our project. We are trying to give voice to your stories and the injustices you guys are experiencing. How has the COVID situation been affecting your loved ones and your family?</br></br>

Caller 2: As far as my family and my girlfriend's cousin, I mean my girlfriend's best friend, she caught COVID. The symptoms, I believe not staying clean and not practicing social distancing.</br></br>

That's something I'm working on myself. I stay back six feet. I don't wear the mask, but I keep myself clean, and I keep myself at a distance from folks so that way I can pay attention to what's really going on, paying attention to the news, looking at the facts of how to stay clean, you know?</br></br>

UCI: Hm-mmm.</br></br>

Caller 2: And what exactly they're really talking about with the COVID-19 thing. I'm taking it serious as far as myself.
