Caller: Well, they, they in February, the end of February, they, they, when was it, February 5th, they, they, they gave me my first shot and the 28th they gave me my second shot. So we pretty much, I guess everybody that, that was, that was in the shot, you know what I mean, got it, you know what I mean? So that’s why they’re letting us program a little bit.</br></br>


UCI: And how has it been like with reduced visitation and programming?</br></br>


Caller: Well the, the visitation, for a minute there, they were, they were doing it with like zoom and recently they started, they started giving, like one day is like one it’s hyper, one day Saturday is zoom still, and then Sunday is contact visit, but, they have to show that, they have, they have to come, I mean they have to come to the prison, like ahead of time so they can get tested themselves. And if they’re, if they’re clear they can go. They let them in, for about an hour.</br></br>


UCI: And how have you been coping with this crisis?</br></br>


Caller: Well, personally, I’ve been, you know, been myself, I’ve been doing alright, so. The only, the only thing is work about the family, you know that I mean?</br></br>


UCI: Yeah -</br></br>


Caller: I’ve been bad, I’ve been in here so long that I just get with it, you know what I mean, it just comes, you know what I mean?</br></br>


UCI: And on that note, how has your loved ones been affected by the COVID situation?</br></br>


Caller: Well, they’re, they’re pretty much the same. They’re worried about me.</br></br>


UCI: And -</br></br>


Caller: But -</br></br>


UCI: Sorry about that.</br></br>


Caller: Yeah?</br></br>


UCI: And what, what would have made the situation at your facility better?</br></br>


Caller: Man, I don’t know how, I don't know how to respond to that because I’ve been in here so long, so I’ve been dealing with a lot of this stuff for years. I mean, and this is the first time we dealt with this so it’s like, it’s like anybody else, you know I mean, I guess. You have to, you know, just deal with it as it comes.</br></br>


UCI: Yeah, and so regard, like, besides that, like is there anything that you would like people to know about the, your experience with COVID-19?</br></br>


Caller: Me personally, I just, just worry about the family and, and the people out there, you know what I mean? But you know, I can’t, I can’t, I can’t, how do you say, answer something where we’re at, you know I’ve never been through, you know, you know none of this, you know what I mean, so. The only thing I care about is that, you know, people out there seem to don’t, don’t care about other people.</br></br>


UCI: Yeah.</br></br>


Caller: You know, so I call it, all this protesting and shit, and about not, not, you know, not wearing a mask out there or not wanting to get the vaccine themselves, you know what I mean? They’re not, they’re not worrying about other people. That’s, that’s, that’s the only thing I, I care about.
