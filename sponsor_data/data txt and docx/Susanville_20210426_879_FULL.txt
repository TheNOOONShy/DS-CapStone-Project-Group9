Dear PrisonPandemic Project </br></br>


First off let me say good morning and how are you feeling today and thank’s for sending your positive thought’s I needed that you put a smile on my face and that made my day and put me back in good health really, thank you. </br></br>


But yeah here my story OK for me I’m just lookin at the world and seeing what’s going on up all night watching the new’s seeing the COVID-19 hit my home town me trying to be safe everyday being in here wearin my mask’s “KN95” scare that I might catch it so I would go to sleep with it on. </br></br>


I know your not suppose to sleep with them on but I wanted to be real safe, plus I have asthma so my mind was all over the place I was terrify for my life my family was on my mind I started back working out to keep my mind as positive lockup in a dorm with like 18 to 23 inmate’s all day and no social distancing and not that much help to prevent the spread you got people that was not taking this pandemic seriously like at all it was really sad you know in all reality the CO’s acting like this was a big game walkin around on the yard’s with no mask’s on at all. </br></br>


Bring the virus right to us and when I was trying to tell them that my life “matters very much” and one of the CO’s told me man you're not going to die and that right there told me that they did not care not only about my life but any other inmate’s life at all. </br></br>


Just come to work and makin everything miserable for me when I am already in this pandemic going through these challenge’s in life. I would never wish this on anyone it mess with your state of mind you know. </br></br>


Just think about it if somebody did not have family and end up hurting their self’s all because these people are not doing their job’s right our live’s are in their hand’s. I know right hard to think about this is what I’m going through everyday in here and that ain’t the half. </br></br>


I still am in the dorm’s tryin to stay safe when it’s testing day and not only 9 but 11 inmate’s test positive they wait to move them out of the dorm and now the game become’s more fun for the CO’s so I catch it and don’t have no symptoms right. </br></br>


I was so worry for myself I started to call home and let my family know what’s going with me cause I did not feel a thing. I was still working out and I did not believe my test result so I ask the doctor to print me a copy so I can see for my eye’s you know and next thing you know they wanted the whole yard to catch the virus so that everybody can come out and program. </br></br>


I was like this place is very very crazy if only the public can see what’s going on up here they will shut this place down for good you know they exception me to be quiet saying in all reality you have no voice sorry my mother gave me a month and a voice so this is what’s happening up here they say god doe’s not like ugly well these people know they’re wrong but they continue to treat people like they are nothing at all. </br></br>


CCC to much wrong doing for one day the next day I just stay out of they way cause they’re out to get inmate’s and give out 115’s and that’s a write up that keep us in here longer then our date’s were human too you know that but that don’t stop them from comin in to work mad at their outside world and most of the time I just stay to myself and stay out of the CO’s face so they can’t found anything to write me up about cause I’m trying to go home and be with my family and start me a nice shoe line or clothing line for the kid’s you know. </br></br>


Show they how to have fun with your dream’s and to keep pushin for the star’s. Thank you for your time and too hear my voice. :) </br></br>


Just some nice quote’s / don’t ask what the needs, ask what make’s you come alive and go do it. Because what the world needs is people who have come alive. </br></br>


Inmate’s have voice’s too we’re only human our life matter’s we just made some mistake in like thank you for listen.
