This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Norco.</br></br>October 30, 2020</br></br>To whom it may concern,</br></br>The COVID-19 crisis incarcerated. It’s frustrating. We’re in dorms with 75 people. They’re putting positive people in with negative people. Everyone is getting infected! I got the symptoms.</br></br>My dorm was on isolation for 14 days. Every dorm that get a positive COVID test. Every dorm goes to one big building for 14 days. They take your vitals two times a day. They give COVID tests once a week.</br></br>I got the symptoms but I got over it, fortunately thank God. The COVID virus took my family, my mum, sis, and brothers. I have no one to visit me.</br></br>I’ve been dealing with it. One day at a time. I tested positive. I had the symptoms: sore back, weak, and fever, diarrhea.</br></br>I took some medication they gave me for fever. It took away all the symptoms. Within four to five days, my symptoms went back away. I have a good system.</br></br>I’m back on my feet. If feel strong and healthy again. I have two cousins left. They buried my mom, sis, bros. I send them my voter's guide. They’re loyal voters. They’re in Louisiana.</br></br>God bless.</br></br>Take care.
