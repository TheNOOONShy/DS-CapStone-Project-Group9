UCI: Okay, so how have you been coping with the crisis, personally?</br></br>


Caller: I'm still dealing with long term effects from COVID and the bad part is since February, there's something called the grievance process. I'm sure you probably know what that is — that's the process necessary to take to you know complain of any institutional issues you may have, whether it's medical or, you know, otherwise.</br></br>


Having submitted one in February they had until March 26 to respond to me because I've been having a throat issue that has been, you know, sick and great discomfort upon me because it affects my voice, it's affecting my breathing, and it's affecting my eating process, and I'm-. I expressed this on the grievance-, haven't even told doctors about this. and whether they're even doing any further testing, there-, I would see a doctor, though they have not yet responded to the grievance, which was dated March 26, within itself is an unconstitutional response.</br></br>


However, even in seeing doctors based in when we put in medical request forms to be seen by doctors issued there, associating it to or relating it to, you know, long term COVID affects. Okay, fine. But still do something to, you know, make-, diagnose me, diagnose what the issue may be, right?</br></br>


I mean you can do something beyond just looking through my throat with a light. You can, you know, order me-, order a doctor for me then I wouldn't go that far. But, unfortunately, that even creates irritation because they're saying their hands are tied because they don't want to do any outside transfers to any hospitals.</br></br>


And so, you know, medically, man. It goes back to the whole issue about safety. I mean, you can't even feel safe in the hands of the doctors because, you know, they're manipulating this COVID situation to, ultimately, I believe it's to save funds.</br></br>


UCI: Mhm.</br></br>


Caller: You know? And when you look at, you know, prison, it's big business. You know? And it's not about, you know, the lives of human-, humanity or human beings, it's about the money you can make-, they can make behind it. That's the reason why the overcrowding occurred. And now they have to be smart of that based on, you know, federal issues that have ensued due to, you know, lawsuits.
