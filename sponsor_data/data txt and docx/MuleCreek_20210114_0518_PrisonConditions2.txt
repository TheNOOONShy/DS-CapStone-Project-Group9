This story was told by a person incarcerated at Mule Creek.</br></br>

UCI: So would you say at the beginning it was being handled, like, well, or how was it different from the beginning of Thanksgiving?</br></br>Caller: Disgustingly poorly. We were considered luggage and storage in the beginning. There were separating us from our property, giving us false instructions, saying that we were going to move back to our spots in two weeks.</br></br> 

We ended up getting in a row, like a journey challenge, gym to gym, going through different conditions. Half the backs were laundry exchange, we only got laundry exchange once in that whole time. Facility B gym had no air, consistent hot water, which was, they let the steam go kind of, you know, circulation, no ventilation whatsoever.</br></br> 

Then you go to Facility C, which was extremely cold, fans blasting, I mean we’re talking about 50 degrees in there, no hot water, so, and no clean spots. Once again, the A and B gyms. I never did experience the Facility D and E gyms, but I know the people who experienced it that were locked in overnight, and on hourly unlock.</br></br> 

It was hard for them to use the bathroom, some of them were actually urinating in empty Pedialyte bottles over trashcans because they couldn’t hold it.</br></br> UCI: I see.</br></br>Caller: Officers continue to try to blame medical, but I mean, because they had to take some part in something, just being civilized.</br></br>UCI: So, what would make the situation at your facility better? Is there anything that you guys particularly need? Is it just more attention to what’s going on, or should there be like better resources?</br></br>Caller: Well, there’s nothing better. The only thing that’s better about it is its almost over. Like, there, almost everybody caught it. They report the numbers consistently wrong all the time.</br></br> 

But those who keep testing negative, they’re putting them in situations to catch it, or taking away their programs. Because they're saying that we’re high risk, and they're trying to keep them safe, but you can’t keep them safe if you just lock them away and say they can’t have a program until they catch it.</br></br> 

So, it’s like you’re punished for being—for not catching it, you're being punished for catching it. They won’t allow them to have video visits because of it. It’s just ridiculous here. It’s not well planned out. They failed.</br></br>UCI: So, is there anything that would make the situation better? To, like, I would say, improve the situation there?</br></br>Caller: Well, the program- the vaccine of course would need to roll out sooner, because right now staff is taking it. But, people who further along in the future, who test positive, they need to lock those cells down instead of them moving in to other locations, which cause possible spread to others.</br></br> UCI: I see.
