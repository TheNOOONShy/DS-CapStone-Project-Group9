This letter was written by a person incarceratd at Solano.</br></br>

On one occasion in the gym we had the warden, chief deputy warden, and chief medical executive of the prison along with many high ranking staff hold an impromptu discussion concerning our issues:</br></br>
 
Issue: 1) After 14 days in the gym (isolation) we were subject to move to any open bed on any yard. This is a problem because many would lose their jobs or programs and this subjected them to being placed into a hostile environment.</br></br>
 
Issue: 2) Upon release from gym, all personal property is placed in quarantine for three days including essential day-to-day cosmetics such as soap, shampoo, toothbrush, toothpaste, showershoes and a comb or brush. Warm clothing was also denied. This is an unhealthy hygiene concern.</br></br>
 
Issue: 3) The gym is overcrowded and not in compliance with social distancing regulations. Beds are not six feet apart. The roof leaks and cleaning supplied are not being made available.</br></br>
 
Issue: 4) COVID is spreading because staff are housing people together who are infected which those who are not. This is created high anxiety amongst the inmates. Building 16 and 23 had no inmates in them and at one point these buildings could be used to house all positive cases. 16 for C yard inmates and 23 for D yard inmates.</br></br>
 
Issue: 5) For those experiencing serious COVID symptoms or for those with pre-existing conditions need to receive treatment for their ailments and make doctor visits available.</br></br>
 
There were other issues as well but I highlight these to reflect correctional and medical staff negligence and indifference towards inmates health and safety. They were dismissive, unwilling to be open to suggestions to real problems. Their attitude reflected: 'How are inmates suggest positive reforms.' 'Inmates don't have a voice, they are supposed to just do what they are told.'</br></br>
 
Clearly I, along with many who experience Solano's inept response to COVID, believes that staff took purposeful and deliberate action to infect the inmate population. Any person who survives this hell would come to the same conclusion.</br></br>
 
Upon leaving the gym, I was moved into several buildings which were quarantined even though I was "resolved:" could go to any building because I can not infect nor get infected for 90 days', yet I could not go to work or receive daily program. Again, I was manipulated and lied to and forced to remain on lockdown until all inmates became resolved or the vaccine is made available.</br></br>
 
Since February 2021, the Moderna vaccine has been given to initially those inmates never infected regardless or age. Then it became random whether infected or not. I self-reported to medical staff on multiple occasions that my 90 days was set to expire within three weeks and request the vaccine so I can remain safe. Many inmates who only recently been diagnosed as COVID positive were given the vaccine while I was ignored and not placed on any priority list. Two days before the expiration date, I told a nurse who's response was: "We'll get to you when we get to you. In the mean time you have a choice on whether to test again or not." That foul attitude sealed my decision.</br></br>
 
As of March 9, 2021, my so-called 90 days window has expired and I am refusing to participate in any temperature checks, swabbings, or interested in taking the vaccine. I don't trust the medical staff at all. They have failed repeatedly in every aspect to address my needs to demonstrate they care about me. Being that half of correctional and medical staff had refused to be vaccinated which also doesn't build my confidence in the significance of the vaccine or it's long-term effects.</br></br>
 
The entire ordeal represents just one of many occasion to which I been subject to prison induced trauma in my 35 years of incarceration. In spite of my repeatedly traumatization, I'm still trying to move forward and share my story. A story which occurred here at Solano state prison and was clearly avoidable and requires reforms to be made to prevent further injustices.
