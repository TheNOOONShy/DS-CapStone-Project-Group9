This story was told by a person incarcerated at Santa Rita Jail.</br></br>Caller: And now they're trying to forcibly make take a plea bargain, and because I won't take it, they have illegally court ordered me to [redacted] State Hospital to be involuntarily medicated without me ever being interviewed by one psychiatric professional of the two required under California State Law Penal Code Section 1368 and 1369. During the pandemic, this is what they're doing at Santa Rita County Jail.</br></br>
