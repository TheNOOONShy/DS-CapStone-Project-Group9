This story was told by a person incarcerated at Vacaville.</br></br>

Caller: Okay, on January – let me see, January, okay, right before January [redacted], a prisoner across from me in the bunk, because it's an open dorm setting, a prisoner across from me was taking a second vaccine, and he had an allergic reaction to it real bad.</br></br>

He started getting chills, cough, and getting sick, headaches. And so, right away they moved him out and put him in quarantine. Well, the next day after that, this was on January [redacted] of this year, they came and got me and got other guys in that area, in that vicinity, and said, "We got to put you on quarantine because you were in the radius of this one prisoner."</br></br>

So, they ended up moving me inside in main line here to [redacted], which is quarantine now. All right, the next day on the [redacted], I don't know who this doctor was, he's some new, unknown doctor – I found out from one of the RNs that he was from San Fran – from Marin or something, the hospital in San Francisco.</br></br>

Anyway, he came in and did a swab. And then, the very next day he tells me, they come in late at night and they tell me, well, you're COVID, you tested positive for COVID. All this time I didn't test positive, I was testing negative, and all of the sudden this strange doctor comes in and says I tested positive. So, they had to move me to the COVID housing.</br></br>

Caller: And, man, when I went in there was nothing wrong with me. I'm going to tell you right now. Look, [redacted], they call it the zombie housing because, man, if you ever seen the movie "The Walking Dead."</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>

Caller: This place was sub-zero freezing like you were in a morgue.</br></br> 

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>

Caller: And I was freezing. Plus, I'm allergic to wool blankets, so all I had was some cotton blankets and I'm freezing to death in there.</br></br> 

Okay, well, that was the day they moved me. The very next day I go into the shower to take a shower because, you know, I didn't get a chance to shower before. So, I go in to take a shower and they got a big old giant fan blowing ice cold air. And this is in January, the end of January. Blowing ice cold air.
