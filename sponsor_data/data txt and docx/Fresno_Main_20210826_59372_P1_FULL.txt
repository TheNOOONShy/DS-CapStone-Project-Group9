This story was told by a person incarcerated at Fresno County Jail.</br></br>

Caller: Okay, during this COVID-19 pandemic, a lot of things been happening. I haven't been able to see my family lately because of the COVID-19. There's situations in my family where they cannot bring little ones, and in order to see my family, they have to bring my little ones because my family members are the ones that are taking care of a certain person.</br></br>

While we're in here, we're supposed to be receiving soap, extra toilet paper, and medical attention. The medical attention takes a while. But we have not been receiving soap lately. We're supposed to be getting new masks; we haven't been receiving those lately, either.</br></br>

Certain correctional officers are getting sick, but they're on sick leave. And the money that we're using in here to provide for ourselves is excruciating. It's really, really bad. In a month and a half, I have already spent $600 for certain things, like medical stuff, hygiene. There are a few people in here that haven't seen their families either.</br></br>

We were getting six free calls; they have turned those down and only getting five minutes a day, five minutes every Monday in order to call our families, which is not efficient.</br></br>

UCI: What about this one? What about this call?</br></br>

Caller: Excuse me? This call is a, well, you say you take collect calls. That's the only reason we can. Like I said, I spent $600 in a month and a half. Frustrated.</br></br>

UCI: That's a lot.</br></br>

Caller: Yes, it's extreme. You know, and that's just mostly hygiene stuff. When we do ask the correctional officers for certain things, sometimes they give it to us, sometimes they don't. It depends on how they're feeling about it.</br></br>

UCI: So, you're paying for the things they are supposed to give you free?</br></br>

Caller: Yes.</br></br>

UCI: Okay. Go ahead. Keep going.</br></br>

Caller: In the beginning of the pandemic, they were giving us once a month a new mask, an extra, a bar of soap, and an extra roll of toilet paper. Now they're not doing that.</br></br>

I'm currently on quarantine in my facility. They stopped everything. We can't see our family. We can't go to court. Certain people had to go home.</br></br>

And in order to go home, they have to go to a certain court date. They're not going to do that. They stopped all trials for us to fight for ourselves. I have a friend who's been going to trial, and they stopped it.</br></br> 

And that, they stopped everything between the court dates. Like I said, it's hectic. They're transferring people from different quarantine facilities to other quarantine facilities, which is not right because people are getting sick.</br></br>

When the correctional officers come in and do count, they're not resupplying their self with gloves; they're not resupplying their self with cover wear. Sometimes we have to write a complaint about the correctional officer using their masks. We feel that they should resupply their stuff, being, how would you say, more alert about what they're doing?</br></br>

I think the facilities should be more cautious in screening. I think they should keep track of certain individuals who have COVID-19 coming from the streets.</br></br>

We were on, for a while, we weren't doing, we weren't on quarantine until a person came in here after, I say, about three days, he came up with, he had symptoms. After three days of being in here, he had symptoms. But they removed him, but still, that doesn't give the right to put us on quarantine because of one person they let go through and didn't screen right. I don't see that's fair.</br></br>

UCI: So, for new people coming in, are they getting quarantined?</br></br>

Caller: No, they're getting screened from out of the jail facility, the correction facility. They're getting screened before they come in, but I figure if they're getting screened out before they come in, why are they still getting sick? Why are they having symptoms after three days? I don't understand if they're getting screened before they come in here.</br></br>

People are getting sick. The people that have been here for a long time and have already been screened, well, before the pandemic, we're getting sick. I've been sick three times. The first one was a month and a half being sick, the second one was two weeks being sick, and the third one was three days being sick.</br></br> 

Okay, I have not got sick after that, but a lot of people that were in here with me, that have been here as long as I have, they're getting sick.</br></br>

UCI: I have so many questions.</br></br>

Caller: Go ahead. I will answer your questions.</br></br>

UCI: Have you been vaccinated?</br></br>

Caller: Excuse me?</br></br>

UCI: Have you been vaccinated?</br></br>

Caller: I've took one shot with Pfizer. I'm waiting for the second one. Because we're in quarantine, they haven't given me my second one. We're supposed to get it this week.</br></br>

UCI: So how is the vaccination situation at your facility for others?</br></br>

Caller: Okay they come in and - well, I guess they put up a notice saying that they're going to give us free packs, a $25 pack for taking either the Johnson or the Pfizer. If somebody takes a Pfizer, they put us in a lottery where they can get $83 packs in a yeah, in a lottery, and if your number comes up or your name comes up, you get that pack.</br></br>

Okay, well, I figure, if they're giving packs like that, people are actually taking the time to say, "Okay, we're going to get the vaccine." In my facility, over 95 percent got their vaccination, 95 percent, because of that pack.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: If they're going to do that, they should do that for everybody. Like I said, we're cautious about the Johnson and Johnson because we always listen to the news. Okay, Johnson and Johnson has some, I guess, has some problems with people getting blood clots.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmmm.</br></br>

Caller: Okay, so, why is this facility giving us Johnson and Johnson when they know that it's been giving people problems? Pfizer is the one that we usually get, so a majority of the people only pick Pfizer. 

UCI: Mm-hmmm.</br></br>

Caller: Other people, the five percent that didn't want the vaccination, it's because of the Johnson and Johnson. They're scared that they might get in trouble.</br></br>

UCI: The lottery is for which one?</br></br>

Caller: The Pfizer.</br></br>

UCI: Oh, okay.</br></br>

Caller: Pfizer is the one that 95 percent of this facility has taken or is taking. But the five percent are scared because of the Johnson and Johnson and the way it came out with people getting sick. This is why the people are not taking their vaccines because they're scared of what's going to happen.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, I can understand.</br></br>

Caller: They don't know what it is. Okay, Johnson and Johnson, we know what's in it now. On Pfizer, nobody knows what's in it, but listening to the news, I understand that people are taking Pfizer and Pfizer, which is a double shot.</br></br> 

If I can get it around to people of knowing what's inside the Pfizer and Pfizer, I think people would take the vaccine a lot quicker and would be acceptable to taking it.</br></br>

UCI: Okay.</br></br>

Caller: But I still don't understand why is the facilities giving Johnson and Johnson knowing that it's harming people?</br></br>

UCI: I don't know. I think it just an option. At least you could like choose, and you have options.</br></br>

Caller: Yes, we can choose.</br></br> 

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: But like I said, that five percent are scared. They don't know what's in the Pfizer. You know? Because, they see Johnson and Johnson as a threat actually.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm, yeah, so getting rid of that option and having only the Pfizer, but people are confused about the Pfizer. I think since it's a fairly new vaccine, everyone, everybody is worried and kind of scared of the vaccine.</br></br>

Caller: Yes.</br></br>

UCI: So, I think it's the same situation everywhere.</br></br>

Caller: Okay.</br></br>

UCI: Well, I'm curious about what medical treatment have you received when you were sick?</br></br>

Caller: Okay, they gave me 15-minute testing, which is the swab to the nostrils, the nasal cavity, okay. One time I had the shivers; it was just the shivers, so they took me to medical. I let the correction officers know, and they automatically did it. But I came out negative.</br></br>

UCI: Oh. Did you still have symptoms at that time?</br></br>

Caller:No, actually, it was, I think it was three days later that they took the test. They called me again. They took my temperature, they took my vitals, and then three days later, they took the test. Okay, after three days later, okay, I'm negative. But why does it take three days later? You know, how come?</br></br>

UCI: What type of symptoms did you have?</br></br>

Caller: I was - I had cold sweats and the shivers, like, everything was so cold.</br></br>

UCI: Oh okay. Were you receiving medical isolation?</br></br>

Caller: No. They bring me back inside the facility that I was in-</br></br>

UCI: We have one minute remaining.</br></br>

Caller: Yes. Would you like me to call again or I can write to you?</br></br>

UCI: Can you call back?</br></br>

Caller: I can call back.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, please call back. We can end this one.</br></br>

Caller: Okay. I'm a call back right now.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, okay. Thank you.</br></br>

Caller: Okay. Yep.
