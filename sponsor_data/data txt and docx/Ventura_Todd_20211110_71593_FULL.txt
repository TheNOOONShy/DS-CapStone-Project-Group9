This story was told by a person incarcerated at Todd Road Jail.</br></br>UCI: The first question I have is: What facility are you currently housed at?</br></br>Caller: It's Todd Road Facility in Santa Paula, California.</br></br>UCI: Todd Road? Okay. And what has the COVID situation been like at your facility?</br></br>Caller: The COVID situation? Oh, it's been, I don't know. I haven't really been paying attention, but they've been keeping it under control.</br></br>UCI: Okay. That's good.</br></br>Caller: I'm here - okay. Go ahead.</br></br>UCI: What about the vaccination situation? Have vaccines been available for everyone?</br></br>Caller: Yeah, I guess so, but I haven't even tried to get one because I don't want to have one.</br></br>UCI: Okay. Do you feel like they've given you guys information on, like, what the vaccine is and what it is to get it?</br></br>Caller: Oh, yeah, definitely.</br></br>UCI: Yeah? Okay. Awesome. Let's see. What has it been like for you to have reduced visitation and programming?</br></br>Caller: Oh, it's been hard. Well, actually, I'm here because - because he's been obsessed with me, and I feel like I'm a hostile hostage right now in a way. And, like, he's been intimidating workers and different people in here - things - to, like, make things, like, I don't know, to do things.</br></br> He's actually hiding in a wall by my toilet and he's, like, I don't know. He's, like, I don't know, like, harassing me and stuff. And dragging my family - children - doing - stuff - and, like, bringing my family here to, like, hold them hostage or something.</br></br>I don't know what he's doing, but this is what he's telling me, and he's literally in this - this corner. It's, like, a closet behind my toilet, and he comes and he talks to me through the vent. And he asks me to let me watch him and all kinds of stuff. I don't know what that deal is but it's crazy.</br></br>UCI: The first part cut out. Did you say that was a guard that's doing this?</br></br>Caller: No, I don't - well, he said he was. He said he was, like, a Federales or something or something like that or said he was a federal - FBI agent, but I don't think an FBI agent would be doing something like this; you know?</br></br>UCI: Yeah.</br></br>Caller: But he - but his name is-</br></br>UCI: Oh, my goodness. Okay. My next question is: How have you been coping with the COVID crisis?</br></br>Caller: I've been doing good except I've just been dealing with all this stuff because he's been actually, like, threatening - he's been actually doing this for about six years - I have a lot of trauma. I mean, I haven't been able - I was forced into a marriage basically by him. And I didn't even -  I wasn't even aware of it, but - he falsified, I guess, and then he's been, like, threatening my family members.</br></br> And I didn't know about none of this until just recently because I have ADHD and I just - I just wasn't look - I was isolated and I didn't know what was going on. And he's been threatening my family members and stuff, and he put me here to frickin' do all this.</br></br>UCI: Oh, my goodness. Okay. It-</br></br>Caller: He actually told me he killed 187 of them. He told me he killed 187 of my family members. I couldn't believe it. I was, like, what in the world is this?</br></br>UCI: Oh, my goodness. Okay. The last question I have before the line ends, what else do you want people to know about your experience?</br></br>Caller: I just want them to know that this is the most horrible horrific experience I've ever experienced in my life and I'm - and it's, like, treacherous and it's been tormenting and everything, and just I wouldn't wish it upon nobody.</br></br>UCI: That's all the questions I have for you tonight. I'm so sorry to hear you're going through all of this. That sounds very scary.</br></br>Caller: Also - but - I know it is, but I'm starting to get better, I think.
