Dear PrisonPandemic,</br></br>

I got your letter and did some research on the PrisonPandemic project. If you call prison newspapers research. Anyways I need your help. Because of the pandemic it's been extremely hard to access the law library. Are you in law school?</br></br> 

Someone has stolen my identity while I’ve been incarcerated. My case number is enclosed. Can you point me in the right direction to get this problem solved? Like can you send me the proper forms so I can resolve this?</br></br>
        
I’d really appreciate it! Being locked up during a pandemic is extremely difficult.</br></br>

My family won’t drive three and a half hours for a 30-minute video visit. It would be a lot better if the prison offered Jpay tablets. Hope to hear from you soon!</br></br>

Sincerely.</br></br>
