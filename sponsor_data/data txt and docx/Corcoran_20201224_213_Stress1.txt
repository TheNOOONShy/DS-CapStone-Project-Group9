This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Corcoran.</br></br>

Today is December 23rd, 2020, and my sixth day on quarantine lockdown. It so, so, so sucks, can’t even call my loved ones for Christmas. That’s how it’s been like to be inside during these times. Much adversity, uncertainty, and a whole lot of anxiety. In the 25-plus years that I been incarcerated, I have not spent so much time just worrying like heck. Day and night I’m thinking if COVID-19 has killed any of my loved ones or friends. Everybody I talk to inside here has the same exact concern.</br></br>

Since I learn of this virus, COVID-19 spreading fast all over the world. This was back in December 2019. As a typical person in prison, we watch a lot of news, that said eventually COVID-19 hit the U.S. cities like an atomic bomb. Dark sad times followed.
