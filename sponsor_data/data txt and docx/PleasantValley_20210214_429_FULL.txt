This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Pleasant Valley.</br></br>Hi PrisonPandemic</br></br>

First of all thanks for all your friendly support. In the letter I received a few days ago. Yes you’re correct these are trying and difficult times and I do hope and pray for all these family members who had lost a loved one. No words can describe what they are going through.</br></br>
Your PrisonPandemic project that you’re involved in is right on! Some people in here needed to hear some positive kind words of encouragement. Before I get started in a nut shell, I am 49 years old, I am stuck here in prison for the crime I committed so many years ago!</br></br>I do believe in positive reform/rehabilitation studies, I myself are involved in groups that have positive results! Sample: “Prison of Peace” “Lifer’s Group” “Domestic Violence”. I stay ever so busy, attempting to reach my parole date 2024. I enclosed a nice photo of me and my gorgeous dog named Hercules, this was my better days at the Ruff Start dog program in SVSP!</br></br>

I helped start the dog program from 2016 to 2019 all I can say is that. It was like therapy, fun, exciting, helping these dogs get a second chance, you know. I threw in the photo to show you guys who you’re writing, a nice guy. If you don’t believe him, just ask him! haha lol!</br></br> 

Now back to your questions related to this horrible prison situation! Do please preserve this ever so truthful letter!</br></br>First of all I had caught COVID-19 here in PVSP. I was in building four on 11/20. I got tested for COVID-19 then instantly the next day I was red flagged with COVID-19 so they, this administration, told me to pack up my personal property cause I am being transferred to a quarantine unit. Here’s the catch you guys, there is no quarantine unit! </br></br>Alls this administration did was clean out a prisoner’s cell and didn’t even bother to help clean it or provide us any disinfectant soaps or cleaning detergent at all, not once. I too witnessed firsthand how the prison administration simply just shuffled us and telling us inmates, this is your makeshift quarantine hospital! get used to it. I am a big baby, but being sick and all, I was being- I was feeling sensitive.</br></br> 

One day I had respectfully asked the lovely nurses, if it's possible for me to please be treated with some medication. But she told me "no Mr., your own body your, immune system is supposed to be enough to help you get better"! She stated to me you’ll receive medications if I am sent to the ICU unit for breathing problems, she’s all "sir you’re fine", that’s a whole 'nother situation so verbally I had backed away.</br></br>You know she’s union blah, blah, blah! Even though this prison tried to help us inmates, some inmates and correctional officers perished, during this pandemic! It was great to feel like we're being helped even though we weren’t, these correctional nurses did their rounds, constantly asking us sick people if we are fine can we breathe properly!</br></br>What really affected me was witnessing inmates being transferred from their cell to a medical gurney and being sent to the ambulance to the outside hospital for safety, life saving. You know I know a few of these inmates, I don’t judge them, they are doing their prison sentence! But when correctional officers have passed away. Oh their poor family going through all they have to!</br></br> 

Simply because of this air born disease, the country and this entire planet is feeling the aftermath, this is horrible! I am happy to actually be alive and my body was able to help fight it off! I feel so grateful! Well if you have any questions, comments, or concerns feel free to ask me. I hope you and your team are healthy safe and sound, I appreciate you.
