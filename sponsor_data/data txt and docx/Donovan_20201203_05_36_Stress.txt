This story was told by a person incarcerated at Donovan.</br></br>

UCI: And what is troubling or concerning to you?</br></br>

Caller: For me, the greatest concern is that now that I'm in my advanced years and suffering from a variety of health concerns, this could actually prove to be a mechanism which I would meet an untimely demise to a disease. Other than any other factor which could, which could cause that to happen to me in a prison environment.</br></br> 

Caller: It's literally the mortality issue.</br></br> 

Caller: Uh, there is an apathy that has become prevalent within the institutional environment, not just here at the facility I'm at. And the apathy that has become prevalent is that the system doesn't care and they're basing that on the outbreaks and spikes that have occurred in some other prisons here in the state of California and the general malaise is that the system doesn't care and that even if a vaccine or some form of combatant drug program were to be developed that prisoners would not be afforded that.</br></br> 

That is the fear that exists throughout the, throughout the entire prison system that we will not be afforded a vaccine or, or any type of treatment even when it becomes available on the streets.</br></br>
