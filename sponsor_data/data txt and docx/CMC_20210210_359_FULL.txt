PrisonPandemic,</br></br>

Blessings and greetings in the matchless name of Jesus, our God his father, and the Holy Spirit.</br></br>

I would like to express my most heartfelt thanks and appreciation for reaching out to us. Prison is indeed a world of its own; a microcosm if you will. Even farther than that it is akin to a petri dish, and much like the organisms that inhabit a petri dish it can get quite lonely in here. And that was before ye olde COVID hit.</br></br>

When things began to close down on the inside I was at Soledad. That's a prison maybe an hour north of CMC. I recall it was around March- yes early March- when all visitation was cancelled. This particular aspect didn't concern me much. I'm single and all of my family lives down in Oceanside near San Diego.</br></br>

However, what that did do was lay a thick layer of tension over the atmosphere of the prison. My birthday is in March, and by that rolled around they shut the church down. I'm a guitarist and vocalist in the church, so I took this development kind of personally (for about a minute or two). This event laid another layer of frustration on top of an already charged environment.</br></br>

A large part of attempting to have an uneventful prison experience involves staying busy. Yet, slowly but surely, these activities and more were being shut down. Visits, church, education, and then yard. The yard is where the phones are at.</br></br>

The central yard at Soledad has nine buildings. At any given time there can be up to six- maybe seven- of those buildings on the yard at one time depending on the cap limit. Before May arrived that was reduced to two buildings in the morning, two in the afternoon, and two at night. This made it easier to get on the phone. Fewer people, shorter lines.</br></br> 

Then they began to institute social distancing, and this cut the available phones in half from six to three.</br></br>

Another layer, please.</br></br>

In April, I received a ducat pass to appear down at the clinic. Around this time American healthcare professionals were screaming about the lack of PPE in the hospitals and clinics where they worked. Despite that, when I stepped into the clinic at Soledad the only PPE anyone was wearing were gloves. That's it!</br></br>

I pulled up short just inside the door and watched as nurses and doctors flitted from here to there without a professional care. I turned left, gave my ducat to the officer at the desk, and said, “I'm not staying here.” “You have to stay to sign the refusal form,” the correctional officer says to me.</br></br>

In seconds I scan the room. Poor ventilation, crowds of prisoners stuck close together, officers and medical staff just walkin’ around like the pandemic doesn't exist. “Nope,” I say, “Not gonna do it.”</br></br>

These words and any others like them are erythema to an officer's sense of absolute authority. I knew this, but I couldn't walk into and then stay in that room. The female officer (who wasn't sitting down) walked up to me and with an attitude way too big for her britches loudly said, “You need to sit down and wait here until we can get a refusal slip for you to sign.”</br></br>

Instead of answering her, I began to point out the various things that were wrong with the scene to all of the prisoners who were in the room. The last thing that I pointed out was how these two officers spend close to eight hours in close proximity. They command us to socially distance, but that is not scientifically sound. Because they would be the ones to introduce the virus to us and not the other way around.</br></br>

Sometimes when you make too much sense some people don't like it too much.</br></br>

As the inmates began to murmur, the male officer comes around the desk and approaches me. I raise my hands and back away into the hallway. All nine buildings annex off of this corridor, thus it is reasonably full of people. This is the only reasonably safe place that exists for me. They follow me out faces full of anger at my audacity to stand up for myself.</br></br>

They argue and I discuss. They're loud and I am level in my tone and this seems to make them hotter. The male officer pulls out his handcuffs, the woman reaches for her baton. If he attempts to cuff me I won't resist but that doesn't mean much.</br></br>

If they want to get rough I'll just have to take it. If I resist then I'll wind up with an ‘assault’ charge. I wound up getting such a charge anyway, but that's another story.</br></br>

Anyway, a sergeant comes out of one of these buildings, sees what's going on, and steps over to where we were. He's level headed and sees my point. Tells me to head on back to my housing unit building, and that was that.</br></br>

Close call.</br></br>

Meanwhile, access to program gets harder and harder to come by. Two buildings at yard at a time shrinks to one. Easier to get to the phone, but once or twice a week. No dayroom, showers every three or four days. And unless you have an essential job like the kitchen or laundry you've got nothing coming.</br></br>

Now whether you're inside of these walls or outside of these walls isolation is still an issue. However, in prison the loneliness can easily plunge to the levels of deprivation. No cell phones, internet, twitter, facebook or instagram means minimal contact if you're out there. Imagine none of that and being locked in a five by six concrete box.</br></br> 

If you have a cellie (cellmate) then it's like being stuck in a bathroom with your spouse. Then take away your spouse and replace them with some random dude. A space so small that if he has bad breath, you can probably smell it.</br></br>

Yummy!</br></br>

Fortunately, I was in a cell by myself. I like it that way. Nonetheless, around the summer I began to sleep less and less. Coronavirus cases began to appear and one guy that I actually know died from it.</br></br> 

Soon I stopped going to yard. I began rejecting the food from the kitchen. Because even though it is cooked mainly by inmates I know their supervisors came in and out of the prison five to six days a week.</br></br>

By this time Fauci has reversed his view on wearing masks, so now the prison is under mandate. Particularly the prisoners. The staff wear them when they interact with us on the whole, but never when they're amongst one another. Mix that in with the fact that the closer the inmate and staff work together, the less likely they are to stay masked up around each other.</br></br>

Now, these types of situations are the most likely culprit for mode of transmission. In all reality this is a closed environment. Under such restrictions as zero visiting and no prisoners being able to leave the grounds and then come back, there remains only one solid way to introduce COVID-19 into a petri dish like prison.</br></br> 

It has to be brought in. By staff.</br></br>

Now this makes way too much sense. So the prevailing thought is that we are still the primary source. I have watched medical professionals say, “it's getting into the prison population through the mail and packages.” They even said it with a straight face.</br></br>

A quarterly package takes three days to get here. Then a week perhaps for the prisoner to get it. I've been in prison for 15 years now. And in all of that time I've never received a letter in less than a week from the day it was sent. The very letter that I am responding to is postmarked January 30, 2021.</br></br> 

It's now February 9, 2021. That's 11 days. Coronavirus lasts 72 hours on most surfaces? Hmm.</br></br>

Yet we are to blame. It's our fault. Our families write us and infect us. They send us packages and those companies infect us.</br></br> 

It can't be the non-mask wearing social and un-distanced staff who are the vector. No. Can't be!</br></br>

I am a 41 (soon to be 42) year old Black man. I've been the fault for more things than I can count. Despite that fact I am still not used to accepting such a status. I know the things that I am guilty of. No doubt. However, like the Rolling Stones say, “I'll never be your beast of burden.”</br></br>

Such false blame, if left unchecked, can take root and become a quasi-truth. It will buzz around in your head like a fly trapped between a screen and a window pane. Desperate to get out, but with nowhere to go.</br></br>

In September, I hung myself. On the 11th as a matter of fact, but the cause was not COVID related. This is where I picked up the assault charge and that situation is how I wound up here in CMC. I spent a few weeks in a suicide ward and from there now I sit in the hole.</br></br>

Yay! 2020 was great for me too!</br></br>

Well, here in one of the most secure places in the prison COVID ran rampant. Both of my neighbors caught it. The cell to the left of me and the cell to the right. No one knows how.</br></br> 

The hole is a dirty place. At least eight people on my tier have had it and I can only imagine the sense of helplessness that comes with that.</br></br>

Out in society at least you can go to a hospital and receive at least marginally decent care. Here? They move you to the other side of the building, lock you in a box, tell you to drink plenty of water, and good luck, Chuck!</br></br> 

If you want to go to an actual hospital you'll either need to die and be brought back or so near to death that they can hear the grim reaper's bones clackin’ in the background.</br></br>

One of my neighbors has come back off of quarantine and he's fine. I doubt that I could’ve caught it from either one of them, but even if it was that highly transmittable it wouldn't matter. Because I can't move away. I am stuck much like that fly and almost completely alone. Almost.</br></br>

I have stayed COVID free and I am no doubt blessed. Then out of the blue, I get a letter from PrisonPandemic. Thanks again for contacting me. It is like a breeze off of the California coast.</br></br>

So many people have lost this battle. Quite a few of them without cause beyond preventing, and that is what hurts even me in this little tucked away box. However, we are Americans and we will rise above this. Eventually we'll come together and move as a nation. It's who we are.</br></br>

May ye be blessed always!</br></br>

Dear PrisonPandemic,</br></br>

Please forgive me for being silly, but I must say that you have exceptionally lovely handwriting. I pray that none of your loved ones have neither contracted nor succumb to this disease.</br></br>

I do have a question. How did you come by my name? I am not perturbed, simply curious. Regardless, I am indeed graciously thankful for tender hand. A little bit of somethin’ is better than a whole lot of nothin’. Thus I'm grateful for your concern.</br></br>

If there is anything else that you desire to know about my experiences - COVID related or not - don't hesitate to ask. If/until then.</br></br>

May ye be blessed always!
