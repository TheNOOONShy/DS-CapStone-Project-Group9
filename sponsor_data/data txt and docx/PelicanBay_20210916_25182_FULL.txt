This story was told by a person incarcerated at Pelican Bay.</br></br> 

UCI: Awesome. Okay. So, tell me what it's been like.</br></br>

Caller: Honestly, it's like usual day for me. It's not that hard. It hasn't been difficult.</br></br>

UCI: What has the COVID situation been like at the facility?</br></br>

Caller: Well, they'll be letting us out for like a week or two. Then they slam it down again, you know? It's been on and off for a while.</br></br>

UCI: Oh, interesting. Okay. And has programming been restarted?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah. We get like an hour yard time, like an hour and a half. Sometimes two, two and a half hours. It depends, you know? Sometimes there's not enough floor staff, so they just give us a little concrete yard in here. You know, it's been okay.</br></br>

UCI: And have they started any sort of classes or letting you use any of the library or books, anything like that?</br></br>

Caller: Well, everything has to be ... They'll deliver, they'll deliver the books to our cells. They haven't opened anything yet. They do, they barely opened school, but we don't go to school, though. They'll send everything to our cells, you know?</br></br>

UCI: Oh.</br></br>

Caller: Like homework, stuff like that.</br></br>

UCI: Okay. So, you're still pretty much in your cell, except for the yard time.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah. Yeah.</br></br>

UCI: So, have you been able to see your loved ones?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah. About a week ago, they opened, they gave us the big yard and everything. But two, three days ago, they slammed it down again, you know? Because of the variants that's going on out there right now.</br></br>

UCI: And so, how long would you say that you had somewhat of programming restarted before they shut everything down again?</br></br>

Caller: Well, yesterday, they gave us a little, like, hour and a half yard time, you know? And today, they were going to give us yard today but they changed their minds. So, we might get some tomorrow. It depends.</br></br>

You know, sometimes they don't have enough floor staff. So, they just shut the program down. But the phone, we get to use the phone like almost every day.</br></br>

UCI: Oh, okay. So, are you able to call your loved ones?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah. Yeah, this is like the third time I called. They wouldn't ... Then again, I called in the morning.</br></br>

UCI: Oh, you call our line in the morning?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah.</br></br>

UCI: Oh, I'm sorry. Yeah, our hours are 5:00 to 9:00. But you're always welcome to, the consent is in our voicemail, so you're always welcome to leave a voicemail with your story, as well. Yeah. If that's easier for you to do, you can do that. But we have students on the phone from 5:00 to 9:00, Monday through Friday.</br></br>

Caller: Okay.</br></br>

UCI: But you mentioned that sometimes they just shut down your yard time. Do they ever tell you why?</br></br>

Caller: Because the thing is, when they shut the program down, that's when ... Usually, that's when a CO gets sick, you know? So, they, like, they shut only the building with the officer wards. You know? But then, like, two or three days, they end up slamming the whole prison.</br></br>

UCI: Are you all regularly tested?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah. Like, yeah. Well, I haven't taken the vaccine shot yet. So, they come and, yeah, they come and test me every, I'd say like every four days or something like that.</br></br>

UCI: Are they testing the individuals who did get the vaccine?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah. Like, they'll test them every, maybe every 30 days or something like that.</br></br>

UCI: Have you seen a lot of people either getting the vaccine or not getting the vaccine?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, the majority had it. They have it already. It's just, I don't want to take it because I feel fine, you know? There's no reason for me to take it.</br></br>

So, yeah. You know, I be hearing on the news that some people be blood clots and stuff like that. So, yeah, that's why I don't want to take it.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, absolutely. You're totally entitled to that viewpoint. Have the correctional staff been getting the vaccine?</br></br>

Caller: Some of them, yeah. Not all of them.</br></br>

UCI: And are they still requiring everyone to wear masks?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah. Yeah, that's mandatory, right there. Yeah, if we don't wear one, they'll give us a write up, you know?</br></br>

UCI: Oh, they will? And what happens when they give you a write up?</br></br>

Caller: Well, usually, they'll take our privileges away, like TV or phone time. Or 30-day yard or canteen, you know? Stuff like that.</br></br>

UCI: So, have you noticed, then, because they'll give you a write up if you don't wear your mask, that there's a lot of people wearing masks?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah. Yeah.</br></br>

UCI: And so, during lockdown, which you're currently in, how are you able to cope? Are you doing any programming?</br></br>

Caller: No. Well, the activity I do inside the cell, I do some exercising. Like, I spend most of the time drawing or reading, you know? Listening to music.</br></br>

I start watching TV at like 8:00. That's when I get into it, start watching a regular program. That's what makes my day go by quick, you know?</br></br>

UCI: Absolutely. Have you been able to still get mail even though you're in your cells?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, they pass mail every day. Like, Monday through Friday.</br></br>

UCI: Have you noticed any of the mail coming in slower? Are they doing anything to help with that, since it's maybe a little bit more complicated?</br></br>

Caller: Well, it is right now because of the pandemic. Everything, like, for instance, if I write a letter right now to my family, they don't get it until maybe ... It takes like two, like a week and a half or two weeks for them to get it. And if you get a letter from me, it takes like almost three weeks.</br></br>

UCI: Oh, wow. So, it takes a week to get to them, and then closer to a month to get back to you?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, because they say it's short staff. But, you know, the mail room. That's what they tell us, you know?</br></br>

UCI: Oh, so the prison is short staffed. Have you seen that affect anything else? You know, as far as maybe getting meals or cleaning?</br></br>

Caller: No, everything is on schedule. We get breakfast around 7:30 in the morning. We get the breakfast and lunch, and then dinner, we get it around 4:30 and that will be it right there.</br></br>

UCI: Very interesting. Have you been able to clean, if you wanted to?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, they do that every day. You know, disinfecting the bars, the tables, the floor. You know, mop the floor. They clean the showers. They're trying to, yeah, they clean every day.</br></br>

UCI: Wow, that's super awesome.</br></br>

Caller: Kind of normal, except that we don't get yard, like, every day, you know?</br></br>

UCI: How often--</br></br>

Caller: We get it like every three, every three days.</br></br>

UCI: Every three days for a couple of hours a day.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, it depends. If nothing happens, yeah. We get like an hour and a half or maybe an hour.</br></br>

UCI: Are they quarantining anyone who does test positive?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah. Yeah, they'll take them to a different building. That's what happened to me the first time, when the pandemic first started. I was working out and the medical staff came around taking temperatures.</br></br>

And I was just finished working out and my temperature was high. So, they took me to a different building because they said that I tested positive. But I told them I was just finished working out, but they didn't listen, though. They quarantined me for two weeks.</br></br>

UCI: And what was that like when you were in quarantine?</br></br>

Caller: Oh, I'm not going to lie, it's kind of rough. Can't get no store. Can't get nothing. Just inside the cell for 24 hours.</br></br>

They would shower us like every other day. So, I was just showering inside the cell like almost every day.</br></br>

UCI: And how many people would you say were in the quarantine area?</br></br>

Caller: Maybe about 20 to 15. Yeah, about 20 to 15 individuals.</br></br>

UCI: Wow. That's so crazy to think about. Well, is there any last thing that you would want us to know?</br></br>

Caller: How is it out there? Everything's still shut down or they start opening--</br></br>

UCI: It depends. Because of this variant, things are starting to get a little bit more shut down, but it's not like it used to be, probably, when you tested positive. But yeah, it's just kind of hoping to get everything under control. But we really appreciate your testimony tonight, and you know, if anything changes, please call us back.</br></br>

Caller: Okay.
