Hello [redacted] and the rest of you at UCI.</br></br>

My name is [redacted] and I received your invitation to write and speak on the pandemic from a prisoner’s perspective. I’d be glad to share and help you all.</br></br>

When the COVID-19 pandemic just hit the prison system I was housed at Donovan State Prison in Hanford. Then I transferred to here at RJD in November. I can tell you Donovan took it a lot more serious than R.J.D. What I mean by that is if inmates tested positive for COVID-10 they were sent to a isolation building and kept there for 30 days.</br></br>

If we went on quarantine we were kept in our cells for 14 days period! No phone calls, we were celled, and only came out every 72 hours for a shower. They did have critical workers (porters) who were inmates who lived in the housing unit, and they cleaned all surface areas, shower railings, floors with cellblock disinfectant and bleach.</br></br> 

Our medications, food, canteen, laundry was all brought to our cells and given to us through the tray slot in the cell door. I can say from March to April of 2020 hardly anyone got sick in my housing unit. One officer, and maybe four inmates. At first, they only gave us cloth face mask to wear.</br></br> 

When it was time for me to transfer in November 2020 to R.J.D. I was placed on a 14 day quarantine and tested for COVID-19 which came back negative along with about 5 other inmates. We were all put on a van. Two people per van and once we got here at R.J.D. we went on 14 day quarantine again and was tested to see if we were positive for COVID-19. The transportation cops were even given temperature checks before they were allowed to drive into the prison.</br></br>

My test came back as negative and I was let off quarantine. The prison was on a semi-modified program. Cellfed, yard was only top tier for all five buildings while bottom tier for all five buildings got dayroom then switch morning afternoon vise versa, canteen, laundry brought to the building. No religious services only in cell, no visiting only phone calls.</br></br>
