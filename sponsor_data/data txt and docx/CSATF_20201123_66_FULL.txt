Dear student from UCI,</br></br>

I received your letter. But wondering how you’d come across my name and number? Just so happens I have plenty of stories and experience to share. Probably enough to write my own book! Over 20 years in the system and recently with the pandemic. Crazy cause we’ve just been hit by it (in my yard).</br></br> 

I am currently re-housed in a cell on quarantine, and this is quarantine #3 for me since the pandemic started. Even though I tested negative every time! It's weird, though, because I’ve been experiencing symptoms, such as loss of taste, muscle aches, fatigue, weakness, and chills, but no temperature.</br></br> 

They “herd” us around, our property in tow, where they feel we should go. The conditions on A-yard are filthy! The place is infested with flies. You must fight them off, just to eat lunch, make coffee or even sleep. I’d get woken up middle of the night if my whole head and face weren’t covered. The cold air blows through our dorm throughout the day, don’t take off your sweats! Everybody caught a cold and then the virus.</br></br>

The phones are on until 12:30 midnight right by my bunk, and then certain individuals, early risers, wake anywhere from 3:30 a.m. to 5:30 a.m. It's just impossible to get any peace of mind here. It’s psychological torture. We’re already doing time, but they can’t/won’t just leave you alone to do your time! It’s constantly changing, moving. I’d kill myself if I was a lifer!</br></br>

Most lifers and inmates who’ve been down a while have lots of property and they expect us to pick up and leave when they snap their fingers. I can tell you, your tax dollars don’t go towards our food and clothing! It's so they can ball out of control!
