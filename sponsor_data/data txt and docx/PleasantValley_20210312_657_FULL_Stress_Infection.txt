This letter is written by a person incarcerated at Pleasant Valley.</br></br>
I'm 50-years-old and I'm Mexican American, born and raided in Northern California. I am a drop-out gang member and I'm on a sensitive needs yard. You asked about how we are dealing with this COVID-19 problem in prison?</br></br>
For me it's been stressful, only because the prison has a lot of programs for us to earn time off our sentences but there's no movement for us because we are on lockdown because of COVID-19. I already got my second shot vaccine for this COVID-19.</br></br>
I never got sick. And never received and side effects from the shots. I am a Christian man and I put a lot of faith in God and Jesus to help me with my mental health. There's a lot of things to talk about but nobody is really going to do anything to help me.</br></br>
But anyway, I'd love to help you if you don't mind me keeping things real and honest with you? My release date ain't until 2033, but new laws happen everyday around here so. God-willing, I pray that I get out way sooner than that 2033 date.
