This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Tehachapi.</br></br>

Salutations to all of you at UCI. I was contacted by your offices in regards to the coronavirus and how as an inmate it has affected me and the population.</br></br>The most recent pandemic in society today is hard alone, less as an inmate residing in an institution under restricted means such as showers and movement.</br></br> 

For the reason of the situation, one would be inclined to believe more showers and less movement would concur. The inability to access the phone is a hardship in itself, wondering if family members are okay and what might they be facing. The experience is not only a difficult one but a troubling one as well.</br></br>I consider myself a skeptic, a witness to those things beyond the blinders of society, the rues that press acceptability amongst the mass of people, not realizing the call for truth. As a skeptic and a man of my caliber one must accept and acknowledge the facts and understand the very real possibilities that are interlaced with the truth.</br></br> 

Over the course of time, history has spoken to us through those of the past, dictating our path and future as a people. With technology constantly growing strong by the minute and modern medicine achieving the same fate, it is no surprise that they have become intertwined in today’s day and age.</br></br>

Henceforth, as the two grow ever so fast like twin siblings year after year, it is no wonder as a society today. The power struggle is realer than ever before with politics governing control and populations growing by the mass daily.</br></br> 

It leads one down the road of ideology of a conspiracy theory to reduce the populations, and/or that of just history repeating itself in modern time. As skepticism and realism sever the umbilical cord of life, it makes it even that much harder to understand man’s nature of war and peace.</br></br> In man’s nature to conquer, war only depletes through the very means of dominance and superiority. This means he who has the larger weapon, whether through destruction or consumption.</br></br>With time, technology has made it possible to compensate such a fate, in making it available to mankind to achieve and overcome its enemies. In the beginning of man’s quest, success has become the very essence of the two merging together.</br></br> 

With psychotherapy, shock treatments, and brain fingerprinting behind us, one begins to believe the cause and effect of the manmade virus is the reason of the coronavirus. The most advanced technology known to man is the human brain and its functions. With technology and what is called modern medicine, we find it possible to access the brain's unused parts.</br></br> Ever since the discovery of one Cliff Stoll, a professor at Berkeley, California, a project of brain activity and medicine was merged together and in the discovery that certain combinations of electric current and pathology paths used could result in permanent brain damage, they realized the opposite was true as to its healing proponents.</br></br> 

The FBI then started a program called brain fingerprinting relating to the ability to read one mind. Armed with this knowledge and the accessibility of the human mind/brain we can, with the help of technology control and simulate human functions, without the person's knowledge. Such as those functions and side effects described in the coronavirus today.</br></br>In short, the result of technology and politics in the wrong hands can result in destructive behavior against society, as a war crime. Remember nuclear warfare, atom bombs, and now this coronavirus. As for a vaccine, it is the natural chemicals the body produces that can heal our woes and sickness. Therefore, on a larger scale it is warranted the need for serums to block neuroactivity via computers and technology.</br></br> 

Take Suboxone as an example. It is an opiate blocker serving the same purpose as the serum made today. The war is not on a battlefield. It is on the internet these days. War crimes are advanced in that way, and the recent five star General David is hard at work.</br></br> People, it is the dawning age of Aquarius on a whole new level, so dealing with historical positive reforms began with each and every one of us. Understanding what is possible is only the beginning of knowing what is at hand.</br></br> 

Let not our religion or beliefs cloud our reasoning. Our awareness to reality is our foundation. Let us rise above this together and make another chapter in the history books, as those who heard the call by way of the trumpet.</br></br> I hereby thank you all at UCI for the opportunity to be a part of history as it were recorded by means of press.</br></br>May peace and glory be with you all, stay safe.
