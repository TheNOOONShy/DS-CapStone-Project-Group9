<em>This story was told by a person incarcerated at Fresno County Jail.</br></br></em>

Caller: We try to give them ideas. When a new person comes into the facility, I guess they have this new thing called a rapid test to where when within 15 minutes, you could go ahead and determine if someone is either negative or positive. But yet they're not throwing anyone into a lockdown pod, which is just a one-man cell, wait until their test results come back, and then throw them into an open pod.</br></br>

What they're doing is that they're testing them, throwing them into an open-cell. And it jeopardizes us because they're either COVID positive, and they could give it to an older man right here that has either a heart condition or that either has health issues. Or what they're doing is they're throwing them in here, and we're not able to go to court or anything like that.</br></br> 

They take them out, and then we end up getting the end of the stick, you know? That's just a little bit of my story and why I wanted to go ahead and share.</br></br>

UCI: That's awesome. We're super grateful for that, you know. You said they're not quarantining anybody new that comes in? So, are a majority of the people in your facility vaccinated and then just asymptomatic? Or how is that working?</br></br>

Caller: So, a lot of us, well not me personally, I've already had gotten COVID. I should have stated that. I gotten COVID, and my attorney gotten COVID. They had thrown me into a COVID tank when there was actually a COVID tank.</br></br> 

They actually released 40 people the other, actually like 45 different people yesterday from one pod, and they're now making that into a COVID tank.</br></br>

So, but the thing about it is, the facilities are not trying to take any responsibility for these people who are sick. So, people who are less violent offenders, they're pretty much releasing them because they don't want to deal with them, you know. Then, later on, when all this pandemic clears, they're pretty much stating that they're going to get in trouble later on, and they're going to come back. Hopefully, by then, the COVID is already ended, which we all know it's not going to end for quite a while, you know?
