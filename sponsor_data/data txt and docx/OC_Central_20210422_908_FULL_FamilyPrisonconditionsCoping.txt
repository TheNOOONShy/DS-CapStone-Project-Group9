This letter was written by a person incarcerated at OC_Central.</br></br>

To whom this may concern,</br></br>

Well, where do I start? First off I thank you for your letter and for your concern. As to my story during the pandemic, well, it’s rough.</br></br>

In no particular order, my younger brother got a trachea in his throat. He couldn’t breathe. My mom and him both got COVID, so did my kids’ mom.</br></br>

Oh, btw, my kids’ mom filed for divorce. She wants full legal custody of our kids because I don’t know how long this county wants to keep me behind bars. There are no resources for me as an incarcerated father to keep in touch with my kids if their mom won’t allow it.</br></br>

I’m sure Stay At Home orders are tough but being incarcerated during the pandemic is tougher. Zero visits from family, no hot meals (cooked meals) for over a year. We have gotten “Bologna” sandwiches for lunch and dinner. Imagine or try eating “Bologna” sandwiches for a month or at least two weeks straight. Well, for us it’s been a whole year.</br></br>

A lot of us have now gained a lot of weight or, in the case of my pal, he has now developed kidney disease and is having kidney failure to some extent. But he is somewhat scared to call the ACLU or any other agency to ask for help, because if we do and the deputies find out, they retaliate.</br></br>

They already target us by “tossing” our cells (they search our property for “contraband” but in reality they just throw our things around). They turn off our televisions, they deny us our mail, they turn off our phones so we can’t call our loved ones. They deny us canteen/commissary, and also deny us free time at our door recreation.</br></br>

As I was saying, it has been extremely tough in here. The only reason it hasn’t been so horrible is because we look out for each other. We all want to go home. We don’t talk about our legal cases, but we do talk about our problems like losing our loved ones or getting divorce papers. Some of us have been shunned by our families, so we have zero support from the outside. I mean the list goes on.</br></br>

I’m not sure if this is enough but I will end the letter here. If you would like to know more, then feel free to ask. Thank you for all that you’re doing for us.
