My COVID experience while in prison</br></br>

Date: March 12, 2021</br></br>

Question number one: What has it been like to be inside during this time?</br></br>

I live in a dorm style environment. It holds 12 people when it is full. The dorm measurements are approximately 25x17x8.</br></br>

We sit approximately three feet away from each other at a table designed for four when we are eating.</br></br>

There are six toilets on each side of the building on the lower tier. There are three toilets on each side of the top tier. They are approximately three feet apart from each other.</br></br>

There are seven sinks each in the bathrooms on the lower tier and five sinks each on the top tier. They are approximately one and a half feet from each other.</br></br>

It is impossible to maintain six feet apart from one another in this prison. Its original design was to hold one person per bunk but because of need to accommodate more and more people, we are forced to have bunkmates and crowd in together.</br></br>

When the pandemic hit, Governor Newsom made an announcement for prisons to stop transferring prisoners because of what happened to San Quentin. CDCR moved infected prisoners to San Quentin and they were hit with a pandemic that they could not get under control. Lots of people got exposed, and got sick, and some even died.</br></br>

On October 27, 2020 inmates that were infected at Old Folsom prison were transferred to Solano prison (where I currently reside). This was done after Governor Newsom told CDCR to stop with the transfers. One of those prisoners was moved right next to me and told me he tested positive for COVID at Old Folsom and went through their quarantine. Then was moved to Solano prison without being quarantined here.</br></br>

I tested positive for COVID-19 on December 10, 2020. I was placed into isolation in the gymnasium that was eventually packed with over 107 prisoners (not including staff) mostly double bunked. Many people felt they did not have the virus and voiced their concerns but, went unheard. Some knew they had it.</br></br>

While in the gym, I reported to the medical staff of the multiple symptoms that I was experiencing. For example, loss of taste and smell, diarrhea, shortness of breath, drowsiness, cold chills, headaches, and confusion.</br></br>

I received no medical attention except temperature, oxygen, and heart rate checks two times a day. As we were all told is mandated because we (prisoners) can’t be trusted with the truth. So they have to run tests on us to see if we have COVID or not.</br></br> 

Funny thing is, is that the whole time I did all that they asked, none of these tests showed any indication that I was experiencing unusual activity. Yet I know I was positive and so did the medical.</br></br>

After 10 to 12 days in in isolation I was cleared by medical to move to another building. I was told that I have to pack all my property and put it into the chapel or dining hall for three days, while it goes through a decontamination period. We were told that we can’t even bring our cosmetic essentials because it too  was to go into decontamination. Most of us hid what was needed under our jumpsuits.</br></br>

There was a time while in the gym that a lot of doctors, wardens, and representatives came to tell us about COVID. We ended up asking them questions about, how come we are so packed in and can’t keep six feet distance apart? How come we can’t bring with us our towels, washrags, bars of soap, comb, shampoo, toothpaste, toothbrush, shower shoes, deodorant and etc. to keep ourselves clean?</br></br>

We were told they did not know that was going on and that we (doctor representative?) would look into it and get back to us, he never did. They also told us (when asked) once we complete the isolation period we are resolved. They said, we “can no longer catch it or give it to someone else for 90 days”. And that we can move to any building and get all our programs back.</br></br>

I was then moved to another building which was quarantined at the time. Even though I was told I was resolved, I was kept in quarantine without dayroom activities, without yard, and without going to work for another 16 days. Once receiving our first yard it was discovered another person in the building who wasn’t positive before tested positive now. So we went back on quarantine again.</br></br>

Some prisoners started refusing to test because out of fear they will be moved from one yard to another, building to building. Our MAC representatives set up another meeting with medical and custody. They asked them why are we still locked down?</br></br>

Their response was because a group of people are refusing to test, so we are going to remain on lockdown until they test.</br></br>

People were being moved all over this prison. We can see we we’re be housed with non-affected people. We voiced our concerns to medical and custody, our voices and concerns went unheard. We even on occasion saw a newly arrival inmate go into a building.</br></br>

I turned in several medical 7362 forms about COVID side effects that I’ve been experiencing. I received priority DUCAT on January 19, 2021, never was seen. I received two priority DUCATs on January 24, 2021, never was seen.</br></br>

I was then put on the critical worker list for PIA in January 2021. I informed all staff at my job of my COVID symptoms that I have been experiencing. I was recommended to see my doctor to get a lay-in. I could not get the lay-in because my doctor is refusing to see me. So, I worked while I was feeling all of these symptoms.</br></br>

On January 28, 2021, I was moved to another building which was quarantined at the time. I turned in another medical 7362 form on February 2, 2021. I received a priority DUCAT. Was seen by a nurse, who came to the building and told me that all my symptoms will all go away over time.</br></br> 

I turned in several more medical 7362 forms which were never responded to.</br></br>

On February 12, 2021, I was moved to another building which was quarantined at the time. On February 16, 2021, I was called up to the correctional officer’s podium who told me that he is on the phone with a unknown nurse asking him to ask me if I am still having difficulty breathing. I said yes, she told the officers that I need to go “man down.”</br></br>

I said that I’m not going to do that because that’s why I turned in the medical forms. I then to tell her that I need to see my doctor. That’s when the officer told me she said it’s no longer on her, it is on me, because she told me to go “man down.”</br></br>

On March 3, 2021, I received a priority DUCAT to see my primary care physician. My regular doctor was not there. I was seen by a doctor via television. I believe he was a outside doctor because of the way he treated me.</br></br>

He asked about all my symptoms. I told him of everything that I’ve been experiencing. The doctor said he ordered blood tests, which I did and waiting for the results. He ordered a EKG, which I did and waiting for the results.</br></br>

He also ordered x-rays to be taken of my lungs and he said he is going to some kind of scan of my head. I just got a priority DUCAT that says x-rays for March 12, 2021. I also need to add that he wrote down priority to get vaccine shot. To this date I have not received it.</br></br>

On March 10, 2021, the nurses came in the building with a list of people that they said needs to swab. I refused. I guess my 90 days that the medical says I’m resolved just got finished. I’m done cooperating with this medical when it comes to me being punished for a positive result!</br></br>

Question number two: How do you feel about your safety inside?</br></br>

I’m scared that I may have developed some long term serious side effects of COVID and I can’t count on medical to help me. I do not feel like medical was there for me. I feel like I have been used, manipulated, and lied to for a hidden agenda that they won’t talk about. I believe the hidden agenda was to purposely infect all of us in here before a certain date.</br></br>

I will not take the vaccine because I do not trust people who lie. I will no longer cooperate with temperature, heart rate, oxygen and swabbing tests because I’m done with being moved all over the institution for the hidden agenda.</br></br>

Question number three: What has it been like to have reduced visitation from family and loved ones?</br></br>

The one thing that was right about this whole process was to temporarily shut down visiting. A lot of diseases, and germs get passed onto staff and inmates, then it gets brought back to the population. I don’t have anyone who visits me but I think it’s a good idea for CDCR to get out of their cave-man-mentality and bring technology in. So people can maintain all those important family ties.</br></br>

Question four: How have you been coping with this crisis?</br></br>

At times I’ve been scared. I did not believe I was going to get better or have a medical team that cared or understood my pain. I had developed resentments and skepticism towards medical and CDCR. I take days one day at a time, hoping these symptoms will go away magically (like the nurse told me) but the fact remains, I don’t really know.</br></br>

Question number five: How have the vaccinations been going at your facility?</br></br>

They have been administering the vaccines the same way they have been treating us, with lies and deceit. Some nurses tell us that only those with certain underlying conditions can get it. Some say you have to be over 65. Some say we have to finish our 90 days of being resolved first.</br></br>

What they say versus what we see is two different things. We seen people who have refused testing of any kind get the shot. My 90 days are now up and I am expected to do their tests, the only problem is, I can’t trust them anymore.</br></br>

That is my story. I’m sure I left off a great deal. I’ve only been moved four times during this COVID experience. There is a lot of people who has been moved about eight to 12 times.</br></br>

I will tell people in here about you and your team and what you are trying to do. I will share with them your letter. I hope you can use this information. If you need me for anything else, just write me, and I’ll respond.</br></br>

Respectfully submitted,</br></br>
