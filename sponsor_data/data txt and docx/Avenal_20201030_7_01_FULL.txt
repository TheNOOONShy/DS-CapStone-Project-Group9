This story was told by a person incarcerated at Avenal.</br></br>
Caller: Uh okay, in March they started the COVID restriction, and being in here I wasn’t wearing a mask. They wouldn’t let me wear a mask.</br></br> They would call people by name and say that I can’t have a mask on because it’s, it would be harder for them to identify me. And in our building, like 90 percent of our building tested positive for COVID. To me, they uh try to dissuade you or get you to where you don't want to test by, if you go to the dentist or if you need to go to the dentist they give you a quick test. And over half the people that test come up positive and each time you come up positive you have to hold an entire dorm to quarantine.</br></br> Um... dorms are overcrowded, you have eight people per dorm, which doesn’t sound like a lot, but your bunk beds, and then when you go to chow you, you know you’re sitting at a table with the four people. And then your bunkies sitin’ at a table with four people, and they're always without a mask and there’s no kind of way, there’s no way to kinda get your own personal space.</br></br>       Um some of the medical staff have real negative attitudes and they kind of voice their negative attitudes around the inmates, which kind of creates a negative environment for the inmates in trusting the medical staff. So uh... basically it’s uh... kinda a scary environment.</br></br> UCI: Okay, so what’s the current COVID situation at your facility?</br></br>Caller: In my building, they have, they had one dorm quarantine, where they took them and when they test positive they grab the, they roll up the whole dorm, they send them to like a lock-up unit.</br></br> 

They’re gone 14 days, and then that one came back, another guy went and from my understanding they swooped on him. In our yard, there’s like I believe there’s four dorms and all the buildings that are in quarantine, and those are people having to go to dentist.</br></br> 

We tested back in May and there was like 90 percent of the building, this building came up positive but we haven’t, as a building, we haven’t did a complete test since. And with the amount of people that are coming up positive just to go to medical, there’s probably, I would assume 30 or 40 percent of the people that have it still.</br></br> UCI: So what is troubling or concerning to you, specifically about your situation?</br></br>Caller: Well the uh, I’ve had it at least twice because I went through the headaches at least twice. Long-term, I don’t know what's gonna happen because they don’t have no evidence of how this is going to play out over the long-term.</br></br> Are we going to keep getting the COVID until it evolves into something that becomes a little more hazardous for our health, our problems?</br></br> 

Um, you know, problems with the mind because... sometimes I think that getting it, when you have it, sometimes I’m wondering like man if I have a long-term effect or something so there’s a lot of people that think like that. But there’s an [unintelligible] that try to do their time and they don’t want to be uprooted.</br></br> 

You have to roll up your stuff and go to the lock-up unit for quarantine for 14 days when they believe like the whole building, they should test the whole building all at one time, and see where everybody’s at. They need to bring down the population.</br></br>UCI: So how was COVID handled at your facility at the beginning of the outbreak?</br></br>Caller: Very poorly. It was hard to be able to wear a mask. And it was uh, they harassed you, they didn’t, the staff didn’t wear a mask. It was um, you know as quick as we wanted to be able to wear a mask, they weren’t letting us wear them, it wasn’t until like a whole building tested positive, that they took it more seriously.</br></br> UCI: Are they saying that because of identification purposes?</br></br>Caller: Can’t hear.</br></br>UCI: Are they saying you can’t wear it for identification purposes?</br></br>Caller: That’s what they were saying in the beginning, and it was really ironic because they called me over by name, and told me that I couldn’t wear a face covering because they couldn’t identify who I was.</br></br> UCI: Okay, what’s being handled differently now?</br></br>Caller: What’s being handled differently now, right. The hard part now is nobody wants to get tested because the results now are, they’re gonna take the whole dorm, and I kinda get it, I understand nobody wants their whole dorm, to you know like if one person tests positive inside a dorm they take all eight people and put them over in a lock-up unit in quarantine.</br></br> 

So everybody’s property has to get boxed up, packed up, and you have to move over there, um freezing cold cell for 14 days and come back.</br></br> But at the same time, you know, this second wave of the pandemic, what’s gonna happen? What’s gonna happen when the flu starts going around, you know?</br></br> 

UCI: So what do you think would make the situation better at your facility?</br></br> Caller: Mandatory testing, like they did every kind of day they tested a whole building, um some of the guys when they first, when 90 percent of the building came up positive, they quarantined the building, but then they brought negatives from another yard and put them inside the building when our building was 90 percent positive.</br></br>So stuff like that, it uh discourages the population on the authority, that we start seeing the authority be irrational, so you have irrational authority take control of you, you have no trust over stuff like that. Everything that they’re doing is such [unintelligible].</br></br> UCI: How has the COVID-19 situation at your faculty affected your loved ones?</br></br>Caller: Aw man I don’t have words. Um it’s financial hood isn’t the way it should because like people in here we don’t have our jobs, we’re all in a, the program’s down to a minimal. Uh we spend more time trying to be like phone busy, or maybe a message, you wanna reach out, you wanna talk to your parents a little bit there’s a lot of worry going on.</br></br>UCI: Okay, we could jump back to the last thing, what do you think is irrational about the authority that you’ve noticed in regards to their response to the virus?</br></br>Caller: The most irrational was when our building was 90 percent of the population was positive, and they brought people, they brought 12 people from another yard into our building and we talked to them and we were like, “Hey are you positive too?” and they were like, “No, we’re negative.”</br></br>So why did they bring a bunch of negative people into a building that’s almost entirely positives? And then someone like me who just like wearing masks, well I get it they enforce it more around the medical staff to put up a front but when we go into the chow hall we sit tables you know, tables are pretty close to one another and you have to take your mask off there, they’re trying to rush you.</br></br> The tables being sanitized while in between feedings, so that table’s like a shared surface with whoever ate there before you. There’s things there that just don’t, you know.</br></br> 

And then like at night you don’t sleep with a mask on so the air that you’re breathing in your dorm, you don’t have a mask on at night and you have a bunkie that’s less than six feet above you, and he’s eating at whatever table, so I mean there, it’s, you can’t contain it in here. You know the best containment that they could possibly do is the separation between us and staff.</br></br> UCI: Okay, are guards made aware of positive prisoners?</br></br>Caller: Um yeah I mean they [unintelligible] really quick, but they need to test the whole building at one time. They haven’t tested us since May.</br></br> UCI: Okay, how have you been coping with this crisis?</br></br>Caller: How I’ve been coping with it? Um... reading, uh you know like we still try to maintain like four or five of us doing AA in a group you know uh, our groups you know social groups so that we kind of keep to this area.</br></br>UCI: Okay, so we are at 14, we are at 14 minutes, just to let you know.</br></br>Caller: Okay.</br></br>UCI: So you’re welcome to call back. What else do you want people to know about your experience? Is there anything else for our last 45 seconds?</br></br> Caller: Hmm, there’s a lot of us worried about the solution and the second wave. And these buildings have poor ventilation, I know this is dorm living, and dorm living is, I mean it’s an apparent disaster waiting to happen.
