Through this COVID-19 pandemic, in prison, it was like an earthquake of emotions. Lots of confusing news reports. Lots of people getting sick, with unknown long-term effects from this disease.</br></br>  You would think inside this bubble called Donovan Prison Facility-Echo yard, the safest place to be, since we are already isolated from the public, wrong, think again. The men and women in green also known as correctional officers, are going home each day and then return to work. They are the ones who delivered, and transferred this Coronavirus inside the prison walls.</br></br>  Then the chaos begun. Wild Spread of COVID-19. Sickness and death happening, and the medical staff and officers having no compassion for us prisoners.</br></br>  Lockdown begins, 23 hours in a cell. CDCR did not have a plan, to help inmate’s survival. Out of mind, and out of sight was their agenda. Furthermore, I did not feel safe behind bars.</br></br>CDCR didn’t provide mask. Only churches and other outside volunteer groups provided mask for our protection. That shows me that administration and correctional officers had no coping skills for this pandemic or crisis of any magnitude. Yes, there was no visits for anyone in blue.
