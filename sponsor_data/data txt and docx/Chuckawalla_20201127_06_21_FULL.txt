This story was told by a person incarcerated at Chuckawalla.</br></br>

Caller: Hi. I'm at Chuckawalla Valley State Prison. I'm on a yard, D yard to matters of fact. That we have been COVID free for, until recently, last month. We've had outbreaks in all other three yards to where the whole community was pretty much sick with the virus.</br></br>But for some reason, or just maybe just dumb luck, our yard, remained COVID free. And we were kind of like the trophies, the trophy yard because all these officers would come down and all the brass would come and look at us, you know, wonder why it was that we remained COVID free. And then officers and free staff started to come to work sick.</br></br>They would actually come to the building and escort these people out of the building because they have failed to check up on their emails from the test site they do, they run here. So, officers, you know, either they're too lazy or just don't care come to work or fail to check in and look at the test site to see if they're positive or negative and then come to work.</br></br>And I guess they check here at work, and they come, and they escort them out of the building. Now this happened three different times in three different occasions. So, they're putting us at risk that way. Another thing they do is - I mean half of them don't wear their mask correctly, or wear a mask or wear it correctly. The other half, they work on other affected yards. Now I'm not saying they're actually, you know, they catch it - well, they might've caught it from there. Or whatever, you know, like residual contamination they might have.</br></br>They come over here, sit at the podium, work with other inmates, the porters, and the porters spread it around. We had one that worked inside the chow hall. And she tested positive. And she got her workers sick. They went back to the building. That one building got sick, it spread throughout the ... and then it slowly bled over into our building.</br></br>So, another thing they did too is they - so, a building gets infected, or one or two guys get infected. They used to round up the whole cube and move them out. And that's pretty good. But like the experts say, there's no true way to tell the infection rate or how infectious a person is. So, they move, they probably move the wrong people.</br></br>But what they were doing this time around was they weren't doing that. They were just taking the individual that was either felt they had sick or had a symptom, and they took them out. Before they would take the whole cube and remove them as well. All the, and anybody they hung around with. Now they're just taking single individuals. So, we got one case in our building. And what was their idea? To move the whole building and spread it throughout the whole prison. A lot of us thought, well, why would they do that?</br></br>I mean just us leave where we're at. If it's going to spread, you know, let it spread amongst here inside of our building instead of taking it somewhere and almost guaranteeing that we get it. So, it turned out like 160 guys in this building ended up getting it. Fourteen of them went to the hospital, and so far, we've had two fatalities in just our one building. I ended up catching it. I was I guess a lucky one. The worst thing that happened to me was a bad headache and I lost my ...</br></br>But I've had friends who got hit hard. Their lungs, they had a hard time breathing. They put him on oxygen at saturation five and sent them to the hospitals around the area. From what I understand, the hospitals were great. These guys were really, they worked hard to help these inmates.</br></br>Actually, you know, made them feel more like human beings than inmates then, you know, like staff here does. So, they ended up moving us. So, we ended up getting it, they put us in, what they have is isolation building. It's on our yard. Another thing too, yeah, it's on our yard. I guess that's a state-wide program. Each prison's supposed to have one building that's just for isolation. Now all they really do there is they just monitor or take our vitals.</br></br>They really don't offer any other, anything like, you know, as far as - well, I mean they offer, maybe if you have a problem, they'll give you medical. But you would think that they would give you extra fluids, extra juice, extra fruit. Things to help boost your immune system, but they don't. It's like almost like they want us to get it. Because once we all have it, then our yard will be pretty much like the other yards and they can get to somewhat of a normal program because we've all been infected.</br></br>So, the ones they didn't move to this isolation building, they spread out and put them in ad seg or family visiting building. Which had infected and pretty much the next building and they all shared the same ventilation system. So, you were guaranteed to get it. They put people in the hole ad seg A3 that didn't have it because they wanted to separate them.</br></br>But instead, the hole is also holding people that have it. And it's all the same ventilation. So, you're pretty much guaranteeing somebody to get it. Then they end up in our yard. They end up back in the quarantine building because now they're positive. Their test results, they kind of had a slow return on them. And we would test on a Monday and we wouldn't find anything until Thursday. And it seemed like the staff is ...</br></br>I'm not going to say that they're insensitive about it, but a lot of them joke about how they want it. They want to get it. They want to get the two weeks paid and have two weeks off paid vacation. So, they're almost counting on getting it. I've seen where officers kind of come and they want to hang out with inmates who do have it. Others, you know, are kind of, you know, standoffish. They don't want to get it because they don't want, you know, the consequences that happen from getting it.</br></br>Because it seems like you can, it's all a crapshoot because you can - I've seen fit people, super fit individuals, which was what I thought. I'm pretty much a fit person. I thought, you know, I can handle it, or beat it off, or whatever. But I've seen guys fitter than me just get reduced to nothing. Lose like 30 pounds. Have constant headaches. Constant cough. And even now after we've been clear for over a month now, they have some type of residual effect from it.</br></br>Everybody's coughing. Everybody has this persistent cough. Everybody has headaches. Everybody feels kind of, you know, they have less energy than they did beforehand. We've seen this thing on 60 Minutes where they're talking about what they call the COVID hangover where these doctors over at Cedars-Sinai are treating people because these individuals, like marathon runners or people who own sports facilities, can no longer run or hold classes because they're, they have fatigue.</br></br>You know, they have no energy to do anything. Or they're in pain. Well, I don't know. It's just kind of like, you know, kind of rung true for a lot of things that are happening here. But I appreciate you listening and hopefully some good will come from this. I thank you very much. Good night.
