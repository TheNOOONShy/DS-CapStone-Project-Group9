This story was told by a person incarcerated at Mule Creek.</br></br>


Caller: It’s kind of chaotic right now. I mean as far as myself, I tested positive um, but before that, I was removed from my housing and I was put in isolation and I was moved around into multiple gyms with infected people before I was even confirmed as being positive for COVID and I recently found out through receiving my test results that I was placed in the gym and I wasn’t even positive yet. </br></br>


So by placing me in the gym with infected people, that is effectively how I got COVID. So that was kind of disturbing to me. </br></br>


It’s still chaotic here. I’m currently in a resolved section, but the prison is just still, it seems like they just don’t know what they’re doing as far as you know the medical quarantine isolation situation.
