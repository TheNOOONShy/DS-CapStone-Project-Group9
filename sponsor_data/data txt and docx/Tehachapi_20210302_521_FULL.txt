The birds sing for spring. It rings in with the reminder that the qualities are upon us again of spring. We daily have learned to do without many things- the pandemic has made a vast in every department of life on earth. The choices we make to it will determine our reaction to be or not to be.</br></br>


My pandemic story pours growing water. I have received both moderna COVID-19 vaccines. I’ve accepted the medical science. The sky above is very blue and very clear for the eyes to see. Love will get us through this changing darkness.</br></br>


Our program is slowly opening back up to more movement. A goodman tested positive for COVID-19 ON February 28,2021. He was quarantined. I think it’s too early to tell by the measure because everybody is taking their precautionary standard down in respect to safety.</br></br>


It seems senseless to me and the people of California to recall governor Gavin Newsom. It is an unwise action to change the leadership when we are in the midst of a pandemic war. The road to where you desire to go is long and unpromising the mass of people. Prison is prison. Prison is not normal, the question is what is normal? Definitions vary from person to person. We are still in the pandemic woods.</br></br>


Let's use or exercise precaution and bound practice supported by common sense.We will prevail. Respect science. Keep the faith in God. “The best is yet to come”.</br></br>


Sincerely.
