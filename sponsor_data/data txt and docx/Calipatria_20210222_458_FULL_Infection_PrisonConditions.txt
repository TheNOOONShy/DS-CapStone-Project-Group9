PrisonPandemic, from the top of my best is with you throughout. I hope you're staying safe on top of things and masking up.</br></br>

I find this interesting that we cross paths and youâ€™re interesting to me based on I had the bad luck of catching COVID-19. Now I am housed in a building that houses 200 men. 100 double man cells. 50 on a lower tier and 50 on an upper tier. I was the first one in the building I am housed at to get sick. I had only left my cell once and that was to attend school for two hours.</br></br>

I have no contact with the outside population so either the staff or the COs were let in sick and gave me this deadly virus. They tested the entire building and me and celly were the only two positive with COVID-19. It went like this from me catching it within a months time over 150 other men in this building caught COVID-19. None of them I had direct contact with.</br></br>

After testing positive my celly and I were sent to ad-seg isolation. We did not see no doctors not one time. I lost my smell, taste. I could barely breathe at night I had to sleep sitting up. I told the nurse that was coming to take our vitals that I was still sick and they still sent me back to my building where there was men that had not been infected. So yeah PrisonPandemic the way this prison went about it was not right.</br></br>

I hope this sheds a light on things on this end. Feel free to reach out back to me about anything.</br></br>

Stay safe and masked up,</br></br> 

Sincerely.
