During the COVID-19 pandemic, I was afraid I was going to die, during the time of the pandemic I was being stalked by Beyonce Carter by the prison moving me around from hospital to hospital.</br></br>

I luckily lived by the grace of God I got the vaccine shot. I am a celebrity hopefully I will be getting out soon to continue to write my movies and books. Please look out for me in Atlanta. Some celebrities like Jay-Z are stalkers. I don’t have a agent or a S.A.G card until next time.</br></br>

P.S I live in Hollywood how did you find me?
