To whom it may concern,</br></br>

I recently received your letter concerning COVID within this prison environment and its effect on me, my experience. Thank you for your concern and hope all is well for you and your staff. Well, for starters, to be completely honest, it is hard for me to be open completely with individuals, especially if they are not known to me, no history. It’s like dealing with strangers. I have been incarcerated for about 20 years now, and I’m sure you can imagine how distant and disconnected it can be from society for an individual like me. But I will make an effort to change by opening up with these few words. Hopefully they contribute a little to what you guys are trying to do.</br></br>
 
I will start here since the beginning of this pandemic, it was a shock to me to hear from my family that not only were people getting sick but there was fear, things on the outside would get similarly restrictive to prison environment, secluded to your homes, limited access to come outside, resources and contact with loved ones.</br></br> 

For me it's been somewhat the same for years. Within these walls it has gotten restrictive with movements and interactions with others as preventative measures. Limits were put on resources, due to the demand and limitations on the outside world. Units were cancelled completely with no access to loved ones due to the sickness.</br></br> 

But for me the things mentioned have been common for me to be used to in some sense. Being incarcerated for 20 years, prison years from the past had the same things going on except the sickness. Year-long lockdown or more, no visits, phone calls then no resources or movements of any kind. Straight confinement to cell living. I became accustomed to that style of life. For many out there, they may feel like they are incarcerated in their own homes, limited access to things, family or people in general. These are common traits of prison.</br></br>

Now during this time of COVID, a sense of fear has been added to my daily life, not for myself but for my loved ones. I still have family there for me throughout the years and even though I’ve lost many since, its the worst feeling in the world, for one to go through a loss while incarcerated. I worry for my parents who are elderly and at risk at this moment of the sickness doing damage. I try not to think negatively throughout these circumstances. I think it will be all over soon, and we’ll count all our blessings and mourn our losses, but the day will be bright.</br></br> 

Here I will have distanced myself from others because people have gotten sick, prisoners and staff alike. I know this thing came in through the outside, but we are fortunate here there has been no lost of life. I try to keep myself healthy like I have for years, because getting sick and dying here, COVID is not the only main threat.</br></br>

I do miss my loved ones being able to see them now because they are the ones at risk, so it heightens the need to see them but I’m used to going long periods of time not seeing them. I just hope for the best, that they are safe and healthy. That’s how I try to see the picture outside the window. I don’t dwell in mind to think the worst, even though the possibilities are there.</br></br> 

I’m fortunate enough to get a chance to hear them through the phone. Their voices ease my mind and emotions, so with that I continue my daily routines here drama free. I don’t dwell on this sickness, that it can affect me, I’m conscious of the threat, but I don’t let it rule my life for the worst.</br></br> 

I’m coping with the situation in the best way know how with what I am working with. I stick to my studies within to progress on change and write to my loved ones continuously. When I can’t talk to them, and their letters keep me going. I’m safe enough, it’s them I’m concerned for. What happens here is the least of my concern.</br></br> 

Well that is a few words. Sorry for the length or sloppiness of writing, but like I said I hope it helps out on what you're doing. I wish you guys all the best on your daily lives, be safe and healthy, the same for all your loved ones out there. I know we all share the same concern at this moment. Thank you for taking the time to hear me out. Happy holidays to all.
