This story was told by a person incarcerated at Kings County Jail.</br></br>UCI: Okay, got it. And then, you said you've called times before, but yeah, how has the COVID situation been like at your facility?</br></br>Caller: Now, on your guys - now, I would like to ask this question because as I read this paper that came to me, when you guys are doing this, right, you guys - do you guys want to specifically know about the COVID situation, or do you guys want to know, are you guys - what are you guys wanting to know?</br></br>Like I've - I've given different stories. I've given my life, things that happen that people are not aware of. I've just - there's a lot of things I've touch base, I've tried to touch on, so I mean, what are you guys really wanting to, you know, know?</br></br>Student: Well, our website is - well like the whole point of the - well not the whole point but - the basis of this project is just to kind of archive and just get to record everybody's stories of life during the pandemic. During, like, while being incarcerated. So, it could be anything COVID-related.</br></br> Or like, yeah we try to stay COVID-related, but if something even like mildly is related, we still like to hear it; anything you want to share.</br></br>Caller: Okay. Well, me person - you know, I've shared this before, so I don't - I feel like I don't want to ramble on about the same things that I've already shared on - on here. But - it's - it's - I don't know. Some - it's - I've already had issues, you know, communicating because I've spent so much time incarcerated, you know?</br></br>Not all in one time, but throughout - throughout the back and forth, back and forth, back and forth, back and forth, you know, in and out. Some things minor, you know usually - basically, the whole thing is over - over having an addiction. I had a drug addiction to crystal meth, you know, for quite some time.</br></br>I, myself, went to high school, graduated, attended college - community college for a short period of time. And now, I ended up leaving. I really had no - no - when I dropped out of college, I had no direction in where I was headed.</br></br>I was still - just had turned 18. I - I just yeah, I had no direction. And going out there with no direction, I was lost. I was lost in a - in a humongous world. I - things - there were a lot of things I didn't know how to do, you know?</br></br>It's - I - I want to start this by saying, saying it so people can get a clear understanding, that you know, I can't - I can't lie, you know? I had a good - I didn't have a horrible life growing up, you know? My mother was very strict, protective, but also was spoiled, you know?</br></br>Kind of everything, I kind of had everything - a lot of things handed to me or done for me. I didn't know how to do a lot, you know?</br></br>I worked one time in high school, you know? I had a job. And I was working at the - I did something for the YMCA working with - around the youth and refereeing the games and stuff like that.</br></br>Well, as an adult, I never - once I went to college, you know, I - a lot of things that I was helped with, you know? Even the groceries in the dorms, you know, my mom, you know, bought everything, you know?</br></br>I was never - I never had to - the - the phone bill, the cable bill, everything was in her name, you know, from, you know, where she lived at to where I was living in the dorms, you know? Community college had dorms there, you know, and really - in California. As I - as I got - as time went, like I said, I dropped out, partying a lot, partying, partying, partying.</br></br>Never taking time aside to study or get my academics together right and focus. Because I never had the experience I never experienced being alone, living alone, and having your priorities in order, and knowing, you know, there's a time to, you know, do the things you want to do or play, you know, but there's a time to, you know, sit down and get your life, you know, something you want to do, a career path that you want to take, you know?</br></br>I wanted - I always wanted - I always liked to learn things. I always wanted to further my education. But like I said, time passed, man and I ended up being - going around some people that I shouldn't have been - been around.</br></br>I been around women I shouldn't have been around, all because I see a pretty face, you know what I mean? And it ended up introducing me to meth for the first time, you know?</br></br>And from there, it just went from random use to everyday thing. And everyday thing started - it just became an addiction. And before long I was - it - it - I was able, when I got off the - the drug, when I was sobered up, I was fine, but when I was on it, the worse things got, you know?</br></br>And I've - I've had the courts give me outpatient program. But what I - what I - what I needed was a program that gave me counseling and gives you assistance, that'll give you vocational training, it gives you job readiness, gives you independent living; it helps you, gives you the tools that you need to survive in life, to help you on your journey, you know?</br></br>I - I've never had the option - the opportunity to be given - to get a program, a drug-living program, you know, a spiritual program, any type of program. I haven't had these chances.</br></br>And this started happening in - I graduated high school in 2006, went to college 2007. I ended up leaving in 2008. My first time getting in trouble, going to jail.</br></br>And just ever since then, it was just back and forth, up and down, just everywhere, you know? It's - I got in some trouble.</br></br>It's - and I told the young ladies this, you know, inside your - that I was talking to before, I was like a year - a year and a half out of high school myself, you know? I was 19 years old. I knew someone that I went - I was in high school with that, you know, I was seeing.</br></br>And we had a relationship, but she was - she was three years younger than me, you know? Well, two and a half, three years younger than me. And I was - she was 16, you know?</br></br>Her dad was okay. I went to church. I asked for permission, you know? I went to his church, asked for permission to date his daughter, you know, and all these different things right. I reach out - I reach out and I take it upon myself to do this.</br></br>Well, the man - the man agrees, you know? Well, he says "Within my vision and with my knowledge, I only want you guys to see - when you guys want to see each other or be around each other." I like, he wants to be aware, he wants to know. "And you can't go off and be by yourselves."</br></br>"I want you here at church. I want to be able to talk to you, have a cup of coffee with you," you know? Me, at that time, I was still into young. I was - I was, you know, still partying and stuff.</br></br>So, he just observed some of the traits, me not going through to the meeting - meeting him, different things after that first initial meeting that I took upon myself to go and meet it with him, and after that it was just - it kinda was, you know it was downhill. He didn't want us seeing each other no more. She started getting in trouble. It just certain little things, you know?</br></br>And you know, at the time, I, you know, I felt like - we both felt like we were caring about each other. We were in love and all this type of crazy stuff, you know? And we're both young, you know?</br></br>I don't have no direction in life where I'm going, and - and she's, you know, trying to find that - trying to find that path, you know? And I - we didn't listen to him. We kept on - we kept on - we kept on seeing each other.</br></br>He ended up calling the police one time and making a report. I end up bascially in the long story short, I ended up getting a year in the county jail. A year with a half, which is six months - I got six months in the county jail and probation.</br></br>I was telling them before; I - it's - it's 261.5(c). It's sex with an underage minor, right? And I was 19, and the girl was 16. Now people, when they say - when a person looks on there, they'll see it's a non-registrable offense.</br></br>You don't have to register, you know? But the judge, in - in that case, he can make you register if he feels that he wants to, if he feels, you know, for whatever reason, he wants to, he can make you register.</br></br>So, with that being said, he - the part of the deal the DA gave me was no registration, just - just do your six months, and complete your probation, and put this behind you. The judge, he said - the judge spoke up and was like, "No, I want him to register." This is in - this is in 2008.</br></br>People have a tendency, they see, "Oh, he has - he has to register?" They consider, they feel that everyone is under that guideline is some type of child molester or some rapist. And people don't understand that it's a big difference.</br></br>Humongous difference. You can't compare somebody that's 19, or somebody 19 and 16, somebody that's 19 and 17, somebody that's 18 and 17, that are two or three years apart, you can't compare that to somebody that's 25 or 20-years old messing with a five-year-old, a 10-year-old.</br></br> You know what I mean? That - that's just - there's no comparison between the two. There's - there's, you can't compare that.</br></br>But when someone says you have to register, that's automatically what goes in your head, "Oh, he - he did some type of - he committed some type of heinous crime. He did some type of sexual act, some type of you know, immoral, something indecent with some child."</br></br>No. People don't understand that, though, you know? And they still like, "Oh, well I'm living next to a sex offender," or "This person - or this person, he has to register." Well, what is, you know - but you don't ask yourself "What is it for?"</br></br>A person doesn't sit there and look it up or go and - go to the court and ask for documentation or records. They just automatically judge you, you know? They don't know, they don't understand, you know?</br></br>And I thank God because a few years back, I had a relationship. It was some years ago, I had a relationship with a psychiatrist. She gave me an opportunity. She - she knew what it was.</br></br>I explained to her what it was. She found out, and she - she understood. She was like "Oh no." She was like - she gave me the time of day. She gave me a chance; you know what I mean? I appreciate that from her.</br></br>This woman makes between $90,000 and $100,000 a year, but to take a leap of faith and take a chance on me, you know what I mean? She has kids, you know what I mean, but she trusted. She knew I was telling the truth.</br></br>She - she looked it up. She under - she was like, "Oh yeah." She was like, "That's not." She was like "That's not - it's a lot of people you went to school with or were in high school with, but they dated older people." You know what I mean? That's saying - it's just, I feel that at times - things are not right.</br></br>But in the prison systems and things like that, I was explaining to your - a lot of your - some of your fellow classmates; they do a lot of things they shouldn't be doing inside of prisons, you know? Showing your paperwork to people. People get their lives taken.</br></br> That's why a lot of you try to read the paper and see certain things, people dying in prison, getting stabbed, and their death, you know what I mean? A lot of times, that's what happens. A lot of times, they do not explain to you what is behind.</br></br>See - see the correctional officers? All they're doing is guess - they're doing guesswork. They don't truly know what is behind.</br></br>They're just going off of what they think and what they - what they're finding, but they - but they don't know. They don't know that man ain't - they don't - they're really not going to tell you the truth because a lot of documents, a lot of things are falsified, and reports are - are, you know, you know, tampered with.</br></br>This - if it's - I don't know if you guys can, am I able to call back? 'Cause it said - 'cause we only have one-minute left. I still have dayroom time left, but I mean, it's up to you.</br></br>UCI: Yeah, you can - it'll end by itself, but you can call back, and it'll be - it'll start the 15 minutes again.</br></br>Caller: Say that one more time?</br></br>UCI: Oh, I was saying you can call back, and it'll just start the 15 minutes back again.</br></br>Caller: Okay. All right. Give me just a quick second, and I'll call right back.</br></br>UCI: Okay, sounds good.</br></br>Caller: All right.
