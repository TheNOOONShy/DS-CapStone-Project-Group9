Since The Pandemic Started, We Hear Talk Of “Missing The Action” By The Corr. Officers. And We Now Suffer A Different Kind Of Punishments. With Less Access To Resources And Programs, We Have To Settle For Whatever We Are Given.
We Are Locked Down All Day In Our Cells. Punished, Given A Phone Call Every Other Day, And A Shower Every 72 Hours. You’d Think That In A Pandemic You’d Want Us To Shower Daily, Have More Access To The Dayroom, Practice Social Distance Of Course, So We Can Use The Phones, And Not Feel Like We’re Being Punished Because Staff and Free Staff Are The Ones Who Can Bring It Into Us. Yet, We Are Being Treated Like We Are The Sick Ones.
Building 13 Has Been Locked Down Sine Friday, December 4 2020. An Inmate That Was Sick, Came From The Gym To Our Building And All Of A Sudden A Positive Showed Up On Him. From Then On It’s Been Testing Mondays, Wednesdays And Fridays. When We Get The Results Back, The Testing Dates Are Backlogged As Far Back As March And April, And Every 10 Days, Mysteriously, They’ll Have 1 or 2 Positives After Mistakenly Letting Out 2 or 3 Kitchen Workers Or CTC workers With Free Staff. Then Our 2 Weeks Starts Over On LockDown.
