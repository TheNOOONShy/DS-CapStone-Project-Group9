I'm wondering if I will be receiving a weekly or monthly issue? Let me know if you will. The prison I'm in has very little function at all. We're always locked down. Showers day soon, and yard are never done on a regular schedule. It's like I'm doing an indeterminate short term! I've been here for years with no write-up or gang involvement, and I was told I wouldn't go to a level 4-270 for two more years. This prison will never function on a regular basis because it barely ran yard before it could become a issue.</br></br>The CCC inmates don't get the mental health treatment required. And when people make big waves about no mental health shows before COVID on after they're removed from the mental health program. Unfortunately, this prison refuses to let the majority of inmates see a doctor, group, or seek help or anything. People are, for the most part, just locked in their cells every day all day. That's Tehachapi's program, no program.</br></br>

Thank you, and have a nice day.
