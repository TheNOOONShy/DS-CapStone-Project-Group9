Good day!</br></br>

Got this letter from one of your students, Devin. I do not really write anyone or the outside for after 25 years. I’ve given up on the outside world.</br></br>

Since you seem to be interested in the goings on in here I guess I can waste a few minutes to give you some info.</br></br>

I can tell you up front nothing you write or set up on any website will ever change how shitty CDCR treats us in here.</br></br>

Let’s see so a year ago when all this COVID started pretty much CDCR did not know what to do and pretty much dropped the ball. Now a year later they really over compensate and we pretty much just stay locked in these cells 24 hours a day.</br></br>

I’m in the mental health program and we are pretty much left to deal with our own problems. With one cell door visit once a week.</br></br>

Pretty much our whole caught COVID-19 last year around June. Most of us stayed in our cells and did not report to medical. Because the first five or six who did test and showed positive, they put them in a stripped down isolation block. And took peoples cells away and left peoples property out to be stolen.</br></br> 

So most of us after seeing how they treated the first ones we just isolated in cell on our own.</br></br>

I would bet out of the 150 people in this block over a 100 had COVID.</br></br>

I did and I spent 16 days isolated on my own because I’ve been in the same cell years and did not want to lose my cell nor my job.</br></br>

See even though COVID-19 is brought into our prison by the COs we are being punished if anyone tests positive.</br></br>

At this date April 29, is on what’s called hard quarantine because one inmate tested positive. He won’t leave voluntarily so we all have to quarantine.</br></br>

Even though most of us done had COVID and even though most of us who wanted or would have done had both vacs.</br></br>

See if you work you have been vaccinated as well as you must test every week. But if any random inmate tests positive then we all go on hard quarantine for 14 days.</br></br>

As it is our regular program for the past year has been two hours yard every other day.</br></br>

But it seems each day it's yard there seems to be a short of staff, a day of COVID testing, or some such that stops us from getting our two hours of yard.</br></br>

This is happening on a weekly basis and most every week we get one yard.</br></br>

You already know about the visits, there’s been none. They are trying to start them back but as I stated we are locked down most days for one reason or another.</br></br> 

So really CDCR has its head so far up its own ass even though they don’t know what they’re doing.</br></br> 

People can’t really change nothing here because really they only let people see what they want them to see. Even if any groups get into our prisons.</br></br>

So anyhow I hope this has provided you with some kind of info. you were looking for.</br></br>

It’s nice to know there’s still people out there who care but really I stopped long ago.</br></br> 

I do not see how any project you may be doing will help us here. For really CDCR will only tell you what lies they want you to hear.</br></br>

Just me.
