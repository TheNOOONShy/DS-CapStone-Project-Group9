Infection
That said, the gym was a place we were sent to die. I found myself realizing that there was nothing to be done for us. Even hearing about a comment a nurse had said about feeling sorry for us because the hospital was not going to take us in because the public came first. ICU’s we’re filling up. I thought about the fact that there was no known cure. We were just separated from (GP) General population. We were isolated! Is truely by God’s grace that we live… Amen. Knowing that there was nothing I could or nothing any one could put things in proper perspective. I had peace.
