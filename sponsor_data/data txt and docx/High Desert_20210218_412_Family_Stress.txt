This letter was written by a person incarcerated at High Desert.</br></br>

My experiences with the COVID-19 pandemic here at High Desert State Prison-B Facility have been uncomfortable. The reason I share this with you, is because I have two children age 10 and 6 of my own out there, and it is scary, because at times I think I may catch it and not make it out alive.</br></br> 

IÕm having a hard time coping with the crisis because of all of this movement/transfers throughout the CDCR and High Desert State Prison. This is all new for me, as it is my first time in prison. During this crisis, I isolate myself from a lot of people to keep myself in the best physical health. As far as reduced visiting, it is not the same being that I have to see my family and friends on screen and not in person.</br></br>
