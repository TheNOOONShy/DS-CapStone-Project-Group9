This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Jamestown.</br></br>Hello PrisonPandemic,</br></br>I’m not sure who I’m writing but I appreciate you inquiring about my wellbeing. Currently, I’m in a fire camp at Growlersburg, which is located in Georgetown, CA. Just recently my whole camp was returned to Sierra Conservation Center because of COVID. Some of the Cal fire captains tested positive and then some of us tested positive as well.</br></br>Once we were returned to Jamestown, they quarantined my camp in two dorms. It didn’t make sense because they were increasing our exposure. The people who tested positive were moved to the gym, which is like a COVID warehouse, and after 14 days they either went back to camp or to “A yard.” I never tested positive, but it seemed like they were incentivizing the contraction of COVID.</br></br>It’s no secret that Jamestown is a poorly managed institution and camps have more desirable conditions. Everyone knew the fastest way back to camp was to test positive. I was the last person returned to camp and it took me seven weeks and three quarantines. It was frustrating because medical never communicated with me. I had no idea why I was still there.</br></br>I’m being released next month on the [redacted], so I don’t know if you wanted to write back or whatever. I hope this is helpful.
