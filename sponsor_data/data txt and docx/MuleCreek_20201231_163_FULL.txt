Dear PrisonPandemic Project,

12/30/20

Happy New Year! First, Allow Me To Just Express Why I Haven’t Called Nor Did I Write Sooner. No One Knows Your Intentions For Existing. Being New, And No Background To Support Your Wanting To Help, Most of Us Believe That You’d Only Make Living For Us Worse When The Pandemic Is Over.

Prison Is Our Punishment For Whatever Crimes Committed To Get Us Here. Punishing Us While We’re In Here is Double Jeopardy Punishments. For Example, Officers Have It In Their Heads That We Are The Bad Guys, So When They Get The Opportunity To Train A New Deputy Corr. Officer, They Usually Train Them To Believe We Are Still Bad, To Treat Us As If We Are Violent And Ready To Strike, And To Take Our Property To Test That Out. Or Talk Down To Us, Give The Rookie A Show-How, And Maybe Some Confidence That He’s Okay. This Is Our Daily Life.

Now Let’s Talk About Since The Pandemic Started. According To The Officers Reports To The Public And To Sacramento, Violence From The Inmate Population Is Almost Non-Existant. They Report That The Pandemic Has Given Them The Break They Needed To Lock Us Down And Show By Statistics That Locking Us Down Is Safer And That When This Pandemic Is Over, They Propose Keeping The Program As It Is Now, In Place So To Keep Us From Continuing To Rehabilitate, Have Unity, And Stop The Works We’ve Done To End Racial Separations In Our States Prisons.

California Prisons Is Big Money To The Corr. Officers When The Inmates Are Pushing Race Wars And Politicing Against Each Other. But When There’s No More Fighting Within The Inmate Populations, Less Policing Is Needed. So Job Security Methods Kick In And The Corr. Officers Now Scramble To Create Issues Between The Races Of The Inmates And Their Hope Is To Keep A Steady Stream of Violence In Play So That They Can Continue To Prove To Sacramento And The Public That Inmates Are Animals. When We Work So Hard To Disprove Those Reports, Any One Officer, Or In Some Cases A Group Of Officers, Will Create An Issue That Can Only End In A Negative Way Because Of The Physical Approach, Putting Their Hands On Us First, Or Provoking One Of Us To Strike First,

Since The Pandemic Started, We Hear Talk Of “Missing The Action” By The Corr. Officers. And We Now Suffer A Different Kind Of Punishments. With Less Access To Resources And Programs, We Have To Settle For Whatever We Are Given.

We Are Locked Down All Day In Our Cells. Punished, Given A Phone Call Every Other Day, And A Shower Every 72 Hours. You’d Think That In A Pandemic You’d Want Us To Shower Daily, Have More Access To The Dayroom, Practice Social Distance Of Course, So We Can Use The Phones, And Not Feel Like We’re Being Punished Because Staff and Free Staff Are The Ones Who Can Bring It Into Us. Yet, We Are Being Treated Like We Are The Sick Ones.

Building 13 Has Been Locked Down Sine Friday, December 4 2020. An Inmate That Was Sick, Came From The Gym To Our Building And All Of A Sudden A Positive Showed Up On Him. From Then On It’s Been Testing Mondays, Wednesdays And Fridays. When We Get The Results Back, The Testing Dates Are Backlogged As Far Back As March And April, And Every 10 Days, Mysteriously, They’ll Have 1 or 2 Positives After Mistakenly Letting Out 2 or 3 Kitchen Workers Or CTC workers With Free Staff. Then Our 2 Weeks Starts Over On LockDown.

When Is It Going To End? How Are You Going To Help? We Don’t Need Any More Story Reporters. We Don’t Just Want To Be Heard. We Need Action! We Need Activists To Actually Put An End To The Abuse Of Power Here, Putting  Stricter Restrictions On The Corr. Officers And Free Staff As Far As Travel, As Well As Making Them Wear Masks That Are  Approved, Not Just Fashionable, And Suits To Cover Up Their Whole Self To Protect Us From Getting Sick. We Are Siting Ducks In Here.
     
If I Haven’t Taken Too Much Of Your Time Already, Take Note Also To The Change That Medical Has Brought To The Prison System: Saboxone. The MAT Program Has Given Addicts Away To Cope and Correct Behaviors That Would Otherwise Play Into The Corr. Officers’ Statistics And Reports. False As They Are! Corr. Officers Complain About Inmates Being Given Rehabilitation Via Medications And Groups To Boot. Not Only Has The Medications Given Us A Hope To Remain Clean, Sober and Productive, It Has Given Us A Safer Securer Place To Do Time. Because Of It, Drug Dealers Are Being Beat Out of The Marker. Because There Are No Visits, The Only Drugs That Are In Prison Are Being Brought In By Corr. Officers And Free Staffs. Same As Cell Phones. Anyone Looking At Those Facts?
     
To Conclude All This, Allow Me To Express Some Views How To Handle These Situations. How We Should Be Able To Program, If You Will. As Far As Each Building Goes, We All Live With Each Other And If None Of us Are Going Out Of The Building, We Should Still Be Able To Program Daily With Each Other As Normal. Dayroom And Showers Daily, Social Distancing With Staff Only! They’re The One’s Who Potentiall Bring It In.

Advocate For Us That We Are Being Punished By Being In Prison, Away From Our Family/Friends, Our Jobs, Our Properties, ETC. That Is Our Punishment For What We Did. Staff Are Not Our Punishers! They Are Highly-Paid/Over-Paid, Uneducated, Baby-Sitters With Only A High School Diploma or G.E.D. No College, But Get The Pay Of A Skilled Office Technician Or Electrician. Let’s Look At Getting Their Pay Down To Help With The Crisis And The States Deficit And Budget. But Prisoners Do The Work Of Real Paying Jobs For Pennies On The Dollar. Let’s Get All Prison Labor Jobs For Inmates At Minimum Wage, Or Even @ $7.00 An Hour To Start.

We Can’t See/Visit Our Family, Or Call When We Want. Let’s Get J-Pay To Put In Their Kiosks And Tablets In Place So We Can E-Mail When We Want, Receive Photos of Our Families. People Are Dying. Some Family Members Only Hope To See One Another Before Passing. That’s So Sad! I’m Losing Family Members To Covid-19 And I Can’t See Them? I Can’t Call Them @ The Hospital On Their Death Bed. But Only If I Could Send A Text To Help My Family Get Strong. It’s Possible, But We Need J-Pay Tablets To Do So.

By The Way, J-pay Tablets Give Us Something To Do In Our Cells, Gives Us More Incentives To Continue To Program. Screw CDCR Wanting A Percentage Of The E-Mails. That’s The Reason I Can’t Comfort My Loved On Via Text Message While She/He Is Dying From Covid-19? Where’s The Compassion In That? Yet, The Board Of Parole Terms Ask Us About Remorse, Sympothy And Insight? What A Joke! Lead By Example!!!

All In All, Look, We Need The Publics Support Against These Revolving Doors, The One’s Who Control These Doors, And We Need To Be Given Opportunities To Show The Public And Everyone In The World That We Are Rehabilitating In Here With And/Or Without The Help Of The People Keeping Us Here Complaining About Rehabilitation And Freedoms, Self-Helps, ETC.

Don’t Get Me Wrong. There Are A Few Corr. Officers With Heart, these That Truly Believe In Humanity And That Change Is Possible With The Right Resources And Opportunities. Like I Said, There Are a Few. I Can’t Name Them Because I Want To Protect Them And Because They Don’t Do it For.

On Behalf Of The Inmate Population And The Few Good Cops, We Hope To See Positive Results In The Near Future. Namely, We Want To See JPay And CDCR Work Something Out To Put Their Tablets Here @ Mule Creek State prison, C-Yard.

Thank You For Your Time.
