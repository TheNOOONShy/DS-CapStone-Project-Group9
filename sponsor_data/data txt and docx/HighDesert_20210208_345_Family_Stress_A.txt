This letter was written by a person incarcerated at High Desert.</br></br>

I see the news and read the paper only to be informed that this coronavirus is not getting better and people are dying in the thousands. That scared me for my family's sake. The last thing I'm trying to find out is that one of my family members died from this virus and me being stuck here in prison, not being able to get out and be there for my family. That would be something I would have to live with and maybe never get over.</br></br>

Living in prison during this pandemic has been difficult. The constant lockdowns. The constant COVID testing. As of right now, I haven't caught COVID. The no visits and not being able to physically hug and see my family makes it hard. But I know it's for everyone's good.
