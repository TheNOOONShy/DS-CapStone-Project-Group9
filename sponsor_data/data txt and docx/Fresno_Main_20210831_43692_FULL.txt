This story was told by a person incarcerated at Fresno County Jail.</br></br>

UCI: Okay. And what has the COVID situation been like at your facility?</br></br>

Caller: Well, they take me out, they take me out every day to go to court. And they test me in the morning, and I'm negative, and then they throw me back into an infected pod.</br></br> 

UCI: Mmhmm. Is there -</br></br>

Caller: Because the pod is on quarantine. Yup.</br></br>

UCI: And what is your - how has the vaccination situation been like at your facility?</br></br>

Caller: What's it like?</br></br>

UCI: Mmhmm.</br></br>

Caller: We're just slammed down all day. We don't get to, we don't get no activities or anything. Our calls are limited. We don't get no calls to call our family, our visits are cut off. Healthcare is really slow. It's just real bad.</br></br>

UCI: I'm sorry to hear that. And how have you been coping with the crisis?</br></br>

Caller: Off and on, it's odd because we've been on quarantine since March of last year at least four times. Including this one, about five times, I would say. And they give us vaccines, and then they just keep bringing people in off the streets and throwing them in the same pod with vaccinated people, and then it becomes an occurrence again.</br></br> 

And then, they test you, and if you're negative, they still continue to keep you in the same pod with positive people. It's just really backwards.</br></br>

UCI: You mentioned you're a court date coming up. Is there a possibility for virtual option?</br></br>

Caller: For what?</br></br>

UCI: Are there virtual options for court dates?</br></br>

Caller: No. No, there are not.</br></br>

UCI: And how has the COVID situation at your facility affected your loved ones?</br></br>

Caller: It's affecting me pretty bad. I mean, I don't even have the same strength anymore. I don't work out. I don't have the same abilities that I had before I had COVID. Even after I got the shots, I was still, I still got sick. Yeah</br></br>

UCI: And what has -</br></br>

Caller: It's more of - it's like it physically, it just messes you up.</br></br>

UCI: And what has it been like for you? Mentally, emotionally?</br></br>

Caller: I'm mentally stressed out because dealing with courts and dealing with the COVID situation, how the courts go over the time limits that they're supposed to go over. And you know, you're supposed to be able to be, they use 30-day extensions. They just use a lot of extensions on these court dates due to COVID and just stuff like that.</br></br>

UCI: Mmhmm and -</br></br>

Caller: Not being able to see your family. You can't get visits. They took our phone calls, our free phone calls away, so you're not able to call your family anymore or see them when you're down on a quarantine pod and stuff, so.</br></br>

UCI: And there's no options for virtual visitation and programming?</br></br>

Caller: No. No, there's not. No, no visits. No visiting. Just - we used to get free phone calls, but they cut those off.</br></br>

UCI: Wow.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah.</br></br>

UCI: I'm sorry to hear that.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah.</br></br>

UCI: And what would have made the situation at your facility better?</br></br>

Caller: For us to be able to contact our families, to see our families. Maybe to separate quarantine people from the people who are already vaccinated. To get the ball rolling on people's court dates so that they could get, they could get, you know, get seen and get out of here or go home to their families.</br></br>

Even like, even for the medical to be even better, you know? Even clean wise, like to have the right cleaning materials and stuff like that, you know?</br></br>

UCI: And is there anything else you would want people to know about your experience?</br></br>

Caller: Nah, that's it.</br></br>

UCI: Well, thank you for participating in PrisonPandemic, and please consider telling your friends about it and seeing if they would like to call in.</br></br>

Caller: Okay.</br></br>

UCI: Okay, have a good night.</br></br>

Caller: Thank you.</br></br>

UCI: All right.</br></br>

Caller: Okay, bye.
