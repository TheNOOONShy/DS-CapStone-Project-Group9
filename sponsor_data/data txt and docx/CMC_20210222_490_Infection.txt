This letter was written by a person incarcerated at CMC (California Men's Colony).</br></br>

I have been incarcerated 21 years so I have seen change before the COVID-19 crisis. The COVID-19 pandemic just gave CDCR more power to really take everything from the prisoners. I understand that COVID-19 made it where that had to be restrictions. And so we are dealing with those restrictions but lets not be fooled, these prison yards are dumping grounds pre-COVID inflicted inmates.</br></br> 

Thirty days ago 19 inmates that are a part of two separate fire crews tested positive for COVID-19.</br></br>

I am at a fire camp where there's three fire crews. When I found out that I had tested positive, I wasn't surprised because I began having the symptom around January 1, 2021. I knew I had COVID-19. I began to lose my taste and my smell. I felt fatigue, tired, coughing, sneezing, runny nose, and other minor symptoms.</br></br> 

I had the virus. Once I began to accept that I would be living with this virus for a while, I kept a positive outlook like I have been doing with any other situation that arises while I am in prison.
