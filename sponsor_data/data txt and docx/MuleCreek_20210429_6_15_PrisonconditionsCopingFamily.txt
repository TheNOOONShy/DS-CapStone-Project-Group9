This story was told by a person incarcerated at Mule Creek.</br></br>

UCI: Mule Creek? Okay. And what has the COVID situation been at your facility?</br></br>

Caller: Well, it’s been a little overwhelming. They keep moving us from once facility to the next, and we are not having access to groups or recreations or Milestones.</br></br>

UCI: Mhm.</br></br>

Caller: to earn time off or visits.</br></br>

UCI: Hmm. How’s, since people have been getting vaccinated, how they’ve been offering vaccination situations at your facility?</br></br>

Caller: Yes, yeah. We have all being vaccinated, all for two shots, through Moderna or Pfizer.</br></br>

UCI: Mhm.</br></br>

Caller: And we are currently being receiving them within the last 60 days.</br></br>

UCI: Okay. That’s good. So, how have you been coping with the crisis?</br></br>

Caller: It’s been very difficult, because I haven’t had access to groups or mental health treatment. Or schools to earn college courses’ credits towards Milestone off to my sentence. Or we used to pay in DRP programs, such as rehabilitative programs, offered to CDCR for time, because you know, for our sentence, incentives. And we’ve been limited to our privileges, then our education, are due respect to the COVID crisis. It’s been a crisis within itself.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah. I understand. So how has this situation at your facility affected your loved ones?</br></br>

Caller: It’s been very hard on us for the prison population because we had zero visits. And, supposedly, they were suppose to issue us tablets, where we can have recorded video chats visitation. However, they basically, barely started within the last, since April. 10th, offering the visits, but they are limited to one person per visit.</br></br>

That distance would , we all had to have masks on, which is, we shouldn’t have to wear mask, I don’t believe it, because we are among the free-iller at this point, from I’m hearing on the news.</br></br>

UCI: Yes. They’ll have to lift some restrictions, they’ll have.</br></br>

Caller: We still forced to even though we’ve all been vaccinated, to still wear masks.</br></br>

UCI: Mhm. Hopefully it gets better as time goes on.  Go ahead, I’m sorry.</br></br>

Caller: Our stimulus checks’ been coming in in the form of debit cards. They haven’t been able, they haven’t been telling us about them nor processing them.</br></br>

UCI: Really?</br></br>

Caller: And they’ve been sending them back without issuing us check, or our benefits. They are charging us restitution on top of them.</br></br>

UCI: Mhm.</br></br>

Caller: Where they’re supposed to be exempted from tax.</br></br>

UCI: Okay.</br></br>

Caller: And they are charging us on tax dollars, you know what I’m saying?</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, so what do you say that your facility can do to make the situation better?</br></br>

Caller: Process, give us the opportunity to send our debit cards home. Notify us with the right top room mail confirmation, meaning we receive them, and give us the option to send them back or send them home, so they can process the crunch for us, our loved ones. You know?</br></br>

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: And there are delays in process for us to receive our funds, and some burdens on our families, because they are struggling on top of us. Struggling, and we’re both in a sinking boat with no hope. It’s like being sunk like a rock.
