This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Valley State.</br></br> 

Dear PrisonPandemic,</br></br> 

First off let me tell you that your letter while it is essentially a school project of sorts was a bright spot in my day. The fact that there are people out there that care for us scum of society is like a breath of freedom air. But while we, in here, know that many out there actually care for us. The amount of those that care for us and our well being and the amount of those that actually take the time to do something as simple as sending a letter varies beyond greatly.</br></br>
 
Hell even getting letters from our own family and loved ones is rare, it seems that the phrase out of sight out of mind is a prevalence when it comes to family and friends in prison. So again thank you. Your letter or concern and well wishes, was and is greatly treasured.</br></br> 

Ok so I can’t, as you know, speak for others experiences and feelings during this pandemic, but I will say that I do know that it’s pretty close to similar in all cases, with only slight variances. Here goes. Here in the prison that I’m in we didn't officially shut down (lockdown/quarantine) until March 2020. We went from 12 - 13 hours out of our cells to 2 - 4 (if we’re lucky). Masks were officially handed out and mandated around late April 2020, after the virus had already been introduced to our environment from either a correctional officer (CO) and/or medical staff.</br></br> 

I mean think about it we are locked away from society and are essentially a petri dish. The only way the petri dish can become contaminated is from the outside. While in my eyes I view us as a vulnerable community like convalescent/retirement homes, since we can not properly social distance. We are not considered that and thus have no priority for the vaccine.</br></br> 

So in this prison here, which is not the standard build of other prisons in California, we have 14 buildings with a max capacity of 256 each and 2 more buildings make up and additional 175 bedspaces. The buildings are spread out evenly between 4 different yards (A-D) that are unable to interact with each other on a daily basis except through school and religious services, both which are not currently being provided. This prison - Valley State Prison (VSP) put bunk beds in the gym, chapel and even the arts in corrections room (all which they used), and even brought in mobile tents and showers/bathrooms onto the yard for extra bedspace (which they did not use) and emptied out one whole building on “B” yard (which is my yard) for COVID-19 positive inmates.</br></br> 

So as inmates got sick they were moved to B-4, the COVID-19 building, for 14 days and once they were released they were not sent back to their bed space of origin. Instead VSP shuffled inmates that were not sick around into bed spaces with others that were not yet sick but exposed and moved the recently recovered into the bed spaces that the non-sick inmates had just been vacated from. Why? I ask, if they had all this extra bed spaces on the facility were we constantly shuffled around? I personally was moved 7 times in the year 2020 due to quarantine protocols in place here at VSP.</br></br>

Now let's say I agree with how they handled all this shuffling around, which I don’t, why is the administration making it hard for us to go back to our yard, building and heaven forbid cell we came from. Let me explain. At VSP unlike many cell living prisons they have 8 man cells. That means I (and other individuals) have to live in a 18’x18’ cell which includes a toilet, two sinks and a shower and 4 double bunk bunkbeds. A rather paradise compared to other cell living prisons. Yet those other prison cells are only two man cells, ours are 8 man.</br></br> 

Having said that I’m sure you yourself have had problems finding a good roommate that you can get along with and can get along with you. College students deal with, what, an average 3 roommates if not less? So imagine trying to find a whole cohesive apartment, or cell in my case, of 7 other roommates. And consider this, arguments in here can and do sometimes lead to murder and or serious bodily injury unlike on the streets.</br></br> 

My point is that in almost 90% of the cases if someone is living in your cell it’s because you asked the COs to do what they call a convenience move (aka-bed move). So that you and any other roommate you wish can live together. This unit of people, be it a 2 man cell or 8 man, become in prison like a pseudo-family. We establish these pseudo-families as a way to protect us emotionally and mentally, sometimes even physically. Replacing the friends and family we lost due to our actions.</br></br> 

Even we outcasts and scum of society still need love and affection, even though we wouldn’t readily admit to it that way in public. So when VSP shuffled everyone around they not only disrupted the lives of inmates but also the bonds that they built with other inmates. Most everyone in prison want to go home, hence the reason we create comfortable cell living arrangements to help us worry about one less thing in here. When we’re on the yard we have to worry about if anyone is going to harm us and such, so our cell (or house as a lot of inmates call it) is our sanctuary.</br></br> 

But due to VSP’s COVID-19 protocols our sanctuaries have been destroyed. And every attempt to ask for convenience moves to reestablish our sanctuaries the CO’s act like typing a few words in a computer is hard for them to do. On top of it all, administration refuses to do convenience moves but for on the weekends. Yet come the weekends the staff don’t really want to do them and/or the regular building COs, which only do the moves for their respective buildings, swap shifts so they have the weekends off.</br></br> 

Thus bed moves don’t get done for months at a time. And to compound the problem VSP instead of sending recovered inmates back to their yards of origin they sent them all over the place. There are inmates that came from D yard on B, C, and A yard and vice versa. And doing moves between yards is like roping the moon. So now we all live in a state of hypertension due to the fact that we live with who they say we live with, with no readily available remedy.</br></br> 

Wow I got into that a little more than I intended, I guess this no convenience move is affecting me more than I thought. Moving on (no pun intended). We are allowed phone calls during 2 of the 4 hours we are allowed out of the cell. Again when we are allowed out there seems to be a lot more program lockdowns than before. Anyways when we are allotted  4 (15 minute) calls per cell (of 8 people) because they implemented a 15 minute dead period after each call.</br></br> 

But my question is this if we are a building full of recovered inmates why are we having a dead period, period? All in this building have either contracted the virus or are one of the very few who have received the vaccine. So again why the dead period? Speaking of vaccines they refuse to give the vaccine to recovered inmates saying that because we contracted it already we’re good to go. So why then are they regularly testing recovered inmates for COVID-19?</br></br>

It doesn’t make sense to me. We few who get visits have hated this pandemic. Not being able to have that time with your family for however sort of often is horrible. But lucky for us they came up with a video visit program which allows inmates to visit with their family through a Skype like app. Yet while it’s only a video visit and does not require the same supervision as in person visits they still limit visits to only the weekend. Wait what!?!?</br></br> 

Yes something that should be implemented through out the week, due to its simplicity, is still only done on weekends. Severely reducing the available time spaces for families to visit. Idiots run this place if you ask me but then again I’m just a criminal so what do I know right? All self-help groups are shut down. Yet the drugs and alcohol are still readily available as pre-pandemic. So addicts are tempted with their vices on the daily without any recourse to turn to a sponsor and/or group for support in not relapsing again.</br></br> 

On a plus side they do offer some self-help courses through the mail which is nice but doesn’t really help when it comes to need for immediate support. Religious services are shut down the religious leaders of all dominations do not walk around at all to see if someone might need their support morally, emotionally, spiritually or otherwise. Yet they all still collect a paycheck like they are fulfilling their duties to the fullest, WHAT!!??</br></br> 

For me this pandemic is torture. I’m five years to my possible release and have been working on things that would show the parole board that I’m not the dipshit I was when I committed my crime 15 years ago. Yet all that got put on hold because of the pandemic. So now something that was going to be difficult in the first place is going to be all the more complicated depending on how long it takes to open back up.</br></br> 

I personally cope with things like this by escaping into my artwork and/or crocheting along with reading books. But unless I get to the meager book cart on the yard before it’s raided the only reading materials I get are those that my family buy using their precious little income. The library while vast is off limits unless you have an open court case and even that is a weird hard to explain protocol.</br></br> 

So I turn to my artwork mostly but with my headspace full of depression and anxiety (among many others) I find even that hard to enjoy and escape into. Crocheting is a nice change because I can make things for others that is useful for other things than a dartboard. Yet the conundrum of getting yarn without using up the little income friends and family have rears its head again. So I usually make do with watching the boobtube (tv). Do to the fact that we don’t to get out as often as before and not on a regular basis exercising is a non-starter. Thus 75% of the population has gained weight the other 25% are those freaks that can eat anything without consequence.</br></br> 

As previously mentioned we only get 4 calls per cell of 8 people so the frequency in which I can call home is not what it used to be. That 15 minutes escape I’ve come to realize means more to me and others than we previously thought. Already there have been more fights over the phones than there has been an entire 5+ years I’ve been at this prison.</br></br> 

As for my safety I really don’t feel as safe as I used to. The environment has changed so much, not just in my cell living arrangements, but also that of the yard. People are more on edge and this tends to lead to violence. Inmates who have tried to do things and/or gets things through the proper channels and have been given the run around will target people they think are unsuspecting and attack them. Because after a fight (or worse) you are moved to the hole. So in their eyes it might not be the convenience move they wanted but it’s a bed move none the less.</br></br>

More people due to this new hostile environment tend not to come out of their cells which compound the outbreak of weight gain and even mental and emotional distress. Me personally I go to the yard every chance I get even if it’s raining because through this all I’ve learned that cabin fever is a real and dangerous thing. Another way I cope with this is writing letters to friends and family even though I know 90% of them will not be responded to. It still makes me feel like I’m part of something other than this horrid place. I live vicariously through others and the letters that I hope they’d send in return.</br></br>

Hope is a bitch let me tell you I believe that hope, not received is what leads to the majority of suicides in prison. Yet we yearn for love still, even knowing it’s dangerous (see attached poems). Since technology has become an everyday part of societies’ lives, writing a letter either by hand or computer has become obsolete. People either text or email each other, both of which are unavailable to us.</br></br> 

Thus mail, even such a one from a UCI student (hell even a bill collector) is cherished beyond comprehension. So once again thank you taking the time to include me not only in the world but in a small part of yours. Your gift of kindness to one such as I is a rare occurrence. Thank you from the bottom of my being. Best wishes to you and yours, take care and stay safe.</br></br> 

Sincerely.</br></br>

“Love Incarcerated”</br></br> 

Love isn’t just hunger. For hunger while it isn’t comfortable is familiar and is nothing to be feared. But love while incarcerated should be! For love is a thirst that leaves your whole body feeling like it’s drying up, parched and near crumbling. Love is dying of thirst on the shores of a vast lake. A lake whose waters are more like the grandest ocean, and none of its waters are for me. Love is a salt sea, that if I drink my fill, would only make me thirst for more and more until I went mad and died. Love is madness, weakness, vulnerability and ultimately death to the incarcerated. And not just for incarcerated like myself but for anyone and everything I’ve ever held dear and loved. If love is all this, then why does my heart yearn so much for it? When my heart knows that to love while incarcerated is to destroy itself piece by piece until all that remains is dust, ashes and eternal desolation.</br></br> 

“Cell # 5”</br></br> 

I’m in my cell on my cot,</br>
put behind bars and easily forgot,</br> 
my freedom to pay,</br>
for three meals a day,</br>
and then I’m left to rot.</br></br>  

Here I sit inside my cell,</br> 
with a letter or two to wish me well,</br> 
they say, “Be strong,</br>
you know you were wrong,</br> 
so repent or go to hell.”</br></br> 

There’s not a day to be had,</br> 
that I don’t feel extremely sad,</br> 
my family I lost,</br> 
that was the cost,</br> 
for the times that I was bad.</br></br>  

She promised to me that she would stay,</br> 
and her love for me would never stray,</br> 
yet my ol’ heart,</br> 
was ripped apart,</br> 
when she left me anyways.</br></br>  

I’m in my cell on my cot,</br>
put behind bars and easily forgot,</br> 
my freedom to pay,</br> 
for three meals a day,</br> 
and then I’m left to rot!
