This story was told by a person incarcerated at Fresno County Main Jail. 

Caller: I wanted to say that what we need most of all right now during this pandemic and this crisis and lockdown, it can happen for 21 days; they say we're locked down. We can't go to court. We have to stay in our cells. And remember, it's the size of a Starbucks. We're really close together. I mean, we have no room to move. We're hitting each other elbows all the time.</br></br>

There's certain things like the buttons don't work in here for emergencies. We can't contact staff for medical reasons, things like heart attacks, attempted suicide. We have self-mutilations happening all the time, attempted suicide. We've got to bang on the doors and stuff just to get somebody's attention.</br></br>

What we need most of all is free phone calls to our families. Because a lot of our families can't afford it - I don't have any family, I'm alone, but I'm speaking for the majority here. It's hard for them to speak because of various reasons; however, what we do need is free phone calls. That would help during this lockdown in quarantine. This would encourage and promote empathy and parenting.</br></br>
