This letter was written by a person incarcerated at San Quentin.</br></br>

As far as being in San Quentin with COVID, you know, I've never been scared of anything in my life, and I was sentenced to 36 years to life for second degree robbery under the three strikes law. I wasn't scared, but I am scared of this COVID virus. Ever since I contracted the virus, things haven't been the same.</br></br> 

I lost my smell, taste, and I have been having irregular bowel movements, shortness of breath, and that's just some of the side effects. I feel like I'm on death row waiting to be executed.
