This story was told by a person incarcerated at Norco.</br></br>Caller: And, so you know, there’s a lot of concern here. You know there’s a lot of fear, but you just got to be strong. I’m struggling. I’m actually in the mental health program too.</br></br>I was diagnosed with depression and PTSD. So, you know, honestly, I’m doing okay. I’ve had my ups and- one of the things that really helps me is my faith, you know, I am a Christian. And so that helps me, you know.</br></br>And I’m just trying to stay positive and surround myself with other guys who are positive and then I also I’m doing my part, you know. I do what’s being asked to. I wear my mask, I wash my hands, I try at my desk when I can to social distance.</br></br>So, I’m doing okay as far as that.
