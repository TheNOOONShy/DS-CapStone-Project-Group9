This story was told by a person incarcerated at Chino.</br></br>

Caller: I ended up lasting 30- approximately 30 days over there before I deteriorated mentally. And I ended up going to crisis bed on the first week in June on suicide watch, I'd actually gotten to the point where I'd actually created a plan, started writing suicide notes because I've never done well personally. A cell alone by myself locked down 24 hours a day.</br></br>

And that's exactly what it was,  24 hour day locked down in ad seg. You get- they were getting more programming than what we were getting. And we were just regular program inmates that had been classified and they got stuck over there with no program whatsoever.</br></br>

I ended up stuck in crisis bed myself for over a month and a half because they didn't know where they wanted to put me.
