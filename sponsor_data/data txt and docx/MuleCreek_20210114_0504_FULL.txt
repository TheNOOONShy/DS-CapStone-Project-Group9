This story was told by a person incarcerated at Mule Creek.</br></br>
UCI: What is the current COVID-19 situation at your facility? Is everything okay? What is troubling or concerning you, if there’s anything?</br></br> Caller: No, it’s kinda messed up because they got people housed in the gyms when they’re not supposed to. Like they lock them in at nine o’clock at night. They lock the door and they can’t use the restroom ‘til seven o’clock the next morning, seven or eight.</br></br> They’re housed in dirty conditions. The medical, like ‘cause I’m diabetic, so the medical they come like hour to hour and a half after allotted time for us to get our diabetic shots. So we ended a- I ended up having a diabetic attack and I fell and split my face open. And the cops ended up breaking my ankle in the attack. I guess they were hittin’ on me and pushing on me from what witnesses said. Plus it took ‘em an hour just to come and respond to the alarm when I passed out.</br></br> A lot of times the staff here don’t wear their masks, but then they force everybody else to wear masks. They force people to work. It don’t matter if they can or can’t. Yeah I mean a lot of it’s just unnecessary stuff that can be fixed and done the right way. They just choose not to do it.</br></br> UCI: So with what’s happening now, was it different in the beginning of the pandemic or is it sort of like the same all throughout since March of last year, the way that these things have been happening?</br></br>Caller: Well in the beginning they were kinda like, they had more of a handle on it and they were doing things more, the correct way. But now since they're doin’ whatever they want, they’re gettin’ tired of dealing with it, they getting tired of dealing with it like it's the inmates' faults that we have COVID. But we didn’t get it until a staff brought it in to us, ‘cause we’re in a secluded area, so.</br></br> UCI: I see. So would you say the treatment of inmates has gotten progressively worse since the beginning?</br></br>Caller: Yeah.</br></br>UCI: Oh I see, and what would make the situation at your facility better? Just like training for the staffers? Or do you guys need any other sort of help?</br></br> Caller: Yeah, staff to have the correct training on what to do and for staff to have repercussions if they don’t follow the rules. ‘Cause like we gotta follow rules, they should have to follow the rules too.</br></br>UCI: And how have you or other inmates been coping with all of this? Are you guys able to have like, at least help inside? Or is there anything that you can do to alleviate the stress?</br></br>Caller: Well like I’m CCCMS, and I’ve put in numerous requests to talk to my clinician and I still haven’t been able to talk to him. Before I put it in, I had to put it in like five or six times and then my clinician will finally come out and talk to me. But I put in like, multiple requests tryin’ to get to talk to him about what I’m going through and stuff like that and I haven’t been able to see nobody.</br></br> And then like I said with this broken ankle I got on the 9th, I’m still waiting for surgery, the hospital told me I needed emergency surgery, like right away and today’s the 14th and I still haven’t had surgery. And I put in multiple requests to medical and they still won’t respond back.</br></br>UCI: And is it, or have you heard from other prisoners to see if it’s backed up? Or do you think it’s just pure neglect that they don’t, that they’re not answering to your concerns?</br></br>Caller: No it’s not me. It’s multiple other inmates that are going through the same thing. It’s just pure like, ignorance like they just don’t wanna do it. And their excuse is just ‘cause it’s COVID-19, they’re backed up on logs, their logs are backed up, but I mean c’mon they can at least you know come and talk to me or somethin’.</br></br> UCI: So you mentioned that you weren’t able to speak with your clinician? Did I hear that correct? Hello?</br></br>Caller: Hello?</br></br> UCI: Hello. So you mentioned that you weren’t able to speak with your clinician, or?</br></br> Caller: Yeah.</br></br>UCI: So does that have like, the fact that you couldn’t speak with your clinician, does that affect your visitation hours or other inmates’ visitation hours? Has anybody at your facility been able to see loved ones or anyone since the pandemic started?</br></br> Caller: No. No, they said they got these video visits goin’ on, but now there’s a bunch of stipulations where you can’t go to video visits. But like my people, they don’t have a way of doin’ the video visits. So me, I haven’t been able to see my loved ones in over a year now.</br></br> UCI: I see.</br></br>Caller: My grandma’s got real bad dementia so you know she’s goin’ through it, she’s really goin’ through it, so the only time I get to talk to her is on the phone.</br></br> UCI: Oh, I see. And if that’s the case, how have you been coping with the crisis?</br></br> Caller: It’s been real hard. It’s been real hard. I try to do a lot of meditation, you know. I try, I write letters you know, to my loved ones, try to help me with the stress but sometimes it gets overwhelming you know?</br></br> UCI: I see. And so for these calls we only have a 15-minute time limit and we’re approaching the 10-minute mark, so I just wanted to ask if there was anything else that you want people to know about your experience with the pandemic?</br></br>Caller: Well I just want people to know about, ‘cause a lot of them, they don’t know about what’s going on inside the prison walls, and that’s why I called ‘cause I wanted to let people know and get it out there what’s actually going on in here. ‘Cause out there, the prisons actually letting people think, make people think that everything is going to plan in here when it really ain’t.</br></br> Everything’s all jacked up and they’re in there mistreating inmates and just abusing the whole system all the way around. So I just wanted to get that out there to the public to let them know. To help them realize what’s really going on in here.</br></br> UCI: I see, and is there anything else you’d like to add? Or is this what you wanted to talk about today?</br></br> Caller: No that’s about it.
