This letter was written by a person incarcerated at SATF (California Substance Abuse Treatment Facility and State Prison).</br></br>

Hey, I wanted to say thank you for taking the time to write me! Knowing someone is thinking about me and not just my wife and family, it felt good receiving your letter, so thanks. I have a story for you guys!</br></br>

I'm 25 years of age soon to be 26. I'm from the city of Los Angeles currently in prison for a robbery I committed. Not so proud of the choices I've made. I was homeless with my wife.</br></br> 

We slept in our car for roughly 9 months, so being homeless made me do stupid things just to feed not just myself, but my wife and I. But sooner or later my actions became reckless, so I found myself again behind a cop car.</br></br>

Sad, but accepting the fact that I would be away again, I took three years state prison in exchange that my wife took six months county time. Well, I really wanted her to get out after the first court date but that's the best I could do. It was clearly outta my hands.</br></br> 

But in the midst of all this being homeless as crazy as this sounds, I asked my wife to marry me, ahah. She did March 2019. I knew I wanted to spend my life with her.</br></br>

She loved me when I had nothing to offer her, not even a ring. That's when I really found out - wow, this is how being deeply in love feels like. I still feel like that when I hear her voice. Oh, forgot to mention, she's home now. I don't know if that was God's way of seeing if we're meant for each other, honestly I do not know.</br></br> 

But we made it through the lying, cheating, and the drugs. Now we are both sober since July 2019.</br></br>

I got to say I'm so blessed I married her. We now have a two-bedroom house that we call home, one car, and she has two jobs. I'm so blessed that she said yes and the best thing about this God has gave me a second chance to come home to my wife and kids. I come home July 2021.</br></br> 

Yes, six months away, but I have to say 2020 was one hell of a year, not just for me but for everyone. Sad that COVID took so many lives.</br></br>

At first, I didn't understand what was a pandemic until I called my wife. She told me everything is a ghost town, that's when I knew it was real. But what really hurt me more, I couldn't help my wife when she needed me most during these hard times. But this is a life experience that I never want to feel again.</br></br> 

I hurt every day, I sometimes cry cause I miss my wife and kids. Different for me I didn't get married in prison!</br></br>

I married my wife when I was home. It was real, we've had each other. So yeah, it's hard coping knowing I can't help her. It's hard living in Los Angeles. Rent's not cheap, it's hard. Life's difficult as an adult. But hey, that's life.</br></br> 

Honestly things got hard for when in October 2020 I caught COVID-19. I was the first in my family to get the virus. Due to me being in shape and working out it didn't do much to me. I did everything I could not to get COVID. I wore gloves, mask, tried to social distance, but it's hard in here, social distance.</br></br> 

I cleaned everything, the phone and kiosk, everything, but still I contracted it. I felt all the symptoms. Couldn't smell and taste, short of breath, fever, I was crying. I thought the worst, sad. They just isolated me for two week, no medication nothing, just to bear with the pain.</br></br> 

Only person emailing was my wife morning, afternoon, and evening. Some days hour on the hour. Some days I was even scared to close my eyes thinking I wasn't going to wake up.</br></br>

I watch the news faithfully every day. A lot of healthy people died so I felt my days numbered. But I overcame it, I feel better today. But not soon after my wife and kids caught COVID-19.</br></br> 

It was heartbreaking knowing I couldn't help her nor our kids. I felt weak as a man. Crying and crying, begging the Lord to protect my family, and everyone recovered. We're all feeling better but the feeling of being distant, it hurts.</br></br>  

And I know the love between us has only grew strong and made us realize it's very lonely on both sides.</br></br>

If it's down to getting a job and helping with rent, or to help with washing our clothes or cleaning the dishes. We take everything for granted. And moments like these when we're apart that I never want to feel pain of being apart. I hate this place. I'm just months away. It's been hard.</br></br> 

I haven't seen my wife since November 2019! I feel so lost without my loved ones. It's been two long years but who knew we would have a pandemic. I know it's made me stronger.</br></br> 

If you was to meet me you'll be like, "you don't cry," but I do for those I love. My heart melts for them.</br></br>

I don't feel safe. The cops here were reckless when it came to protecting me from this virus. They don't clean as much as they're supposed to. There ain't much social distancing.</br></br> 

And the cops don't be wearing their mask, and they're the main people coming in and out of this prison.</br></br>

Visitation, my wife and I came to an understanding, it's not that serious. It's not worth being around too many people and catching the virus, so we're not taking no chances.</br></br>

But it's hard being in prison. Constantly having to watch your back. You have a lot of people here that don't care on going home, or don't have anyone. No family, loved ones, so you have to pick and choose to hang around with.</br></br> 

You got rapists, murderers, drug dealers, etc. I stay away from all. I don't have no friends in this place, and I'm fine with that. I didn't come to prison to make friends, I came here to do my time.</br></br>

But the only person I take advice from is my wife, and she keeps me positive and daily lets me know this place is temporary. Hearing my wife's voice gives me strength every day to be a better man, and had taught me not to take things for granted, and I don't. I've realized this life isn't for me. My best day in prison don't compare to my worst day in society!</br></br> 

I rather live in misery in society than live good and have everything in prison, cause at the end of the day, I'm alone.</br></br>

I don't have anyone that loves me here. I keep myself warm at night in my bed, and it's lonely. It's very depressing behind these walls. I hate it here, but I knew the outcome when I committed my crime.</br></br> 

My wife keeps me going. Her voice matters, and without her in my life, I make stupid decisions, and I know I'm better than that. I value myself now, it took me 25 years, but now I value myself.</br></br>

She is such a beautiful soul and person. I'm just thankful I can call her my wife. But thank you for taking the time to write me and asking how I'm doing. May God bless you and put a shield of protection over all of you. Believe it or not, but your letter brought joy to my heart and I thank you. Have a blessed and joyful day.</br></br>

Sincerely.
