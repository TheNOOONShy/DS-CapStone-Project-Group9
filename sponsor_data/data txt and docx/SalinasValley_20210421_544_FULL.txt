This story was told by a person incarcerated at Salinas Valley.</br></br>


UCI: Okay, and how has the COVID situation been for them. Please continue.</br></br>


Caller:  Well, the COVID situation goes up and down because staff basically continue to bring the COVID into the house. Also, they don’t really wear their masks -- they wear them on their chin, and they see individuals like that as well, so the COVID situation goes up and down. They might tell you that it’s low, but they lied because they just had issues the other day. But, the thing about that is, I stayed in my room so I don’t, you know, I never received it.</br></br> 


But, what they do, they move inmates from one unit to another, and that is cross, cross-contaminating, you know, the whole thing. That’s how people is getting it. Also, you have staff bringing it in, and they speak with people knowing that they might have it, they might not have it. Then, tomorrow, which is April 22nd, they’re supposed to search the whole unit. Now, that’s dangerous because, for you to have all your officers into a unit search knowing that there’s a chance that these guys have COVID.</br></br>


UCI: Mhm.</br></br>


Caller: But they leave them in their rooms instead of separating them from the GP, you know?</br></br>


UCI: Mhm.</br></br>


Caller: Yeah, I mean, you know, what they’re doing here is very disrespectful. It’s foul, and they’re doing what they do because they feel like they can do it. Staff is bringing in COVID, but then, you know, kids get the temperature thing done. You know, that’s not really saying a person has, well, has it or not, because they can have a low temperature and still have it, you know? So, it’s not good, you know? You know, like I said, they just had a situation the other day where somebody had COVID.</br></br> 


UCI: Mm.</br></br>


Caller: So, you know, all it takes is one person. You know, we don’t use no type of disinfectant at all. They don’t let us use it, nothing like that. So, you know, if you’re trying to stop us from getting it, that’s impossible. You know what I mean? You know, with me, I have issues with breathing, so that’s why I stay in my room. You know, so that’s what’s going on here. Oh, and they’re also transferring people. They transfer them in, they transfer them out. That, that means you don’t know who has it, you know? So, that’s what’s going on in Salinas Valley State Prison.</br></br>


UCI: Okay, thank you for telling me that. How has the vaccination situation been like at the facility since they’ve been vaccinating now?</br></br>


Caller: Well, they’ve been coming through. They’re offering everybody a vaccination. I, I refuse to take it. I didn’t wanna take it because of the way it was being done. They was doing it, they was doing it around everyone, and then, at the same time the next day, you got staff coming in without their masks on their face, but they on their chin, so I’m like, “No, I’m not taking that.” Why, what for? You know, take it. Then, you end up with COVID after-the-fact? No, I’m not doing it.</br></br> 


UCI: Mm.</br></br> 


Caller: Yeah, yeah.</br></br>


UCI: Understandable, I respect that. I’m sorry, go ahead.</br></br>


Caller: What did you say?</br></br>


UCI: I said I respect that. I was going to ask you how, well, like, how has it, like, affected your loved ones?</br></br>


Caller: Oh, well, my daughter’s had it. You mean, affect them as far as them having COVID?</br></br>


UCI: Yes, or just the situation at your facility in general.</br></br>


Caller: Oh, they worry about my situation. They know that, with me being, you know, older and having breathing issues and stuff, they know there’s a chance I can get it and not even make it out the system.</br></br>


UCI: Hm.</br></br>


Caller: Yeah, yeah, so they’re worried about it. And, you know, they claim that they let people out based on COVID but my, you know, my case is nonviolent. Nonviolent, no victims, just me on the violations, but still, no. They don’t let me out at all. They leave me here.</br></br>


UCI: Mhm. So, how have you been coping with that?</br></br>


Caller: You know what, it’s very frustrating and upsetting because they’re supposed to went around to all the institutions. Anybody 60, close to 60 and they having issues, health issues, underlying health issues -- they’re supposed to look at that and let them go home, but they don’t do it at all. That’s the one thing they tell the media, but it’s not the truth, you know?</br></br>


UCI: Mm.</br></br>


Caller: It’s not the truth, you know. If we had millions and millions of dollars, yes. But since we don’t have millions and millions of dollars, then that’s what they gonna lie and say that this is what they, this is what they doing when they not actually doing it. You know, if my name was Weinstein, somebody with dollars, then okay. Talk about being in a halfway house, I’d be in my house somewhere under house arrest or whatever it may be, you know? The CDCR, they lie to everybody. They don’t follow the rules. The union, the union don’t want things right; they want issues and problems, you know?</br></br>


UCI: Mhm.</br></br>


Caller: Because it makes them look better.</br></br> 


UCI: So, that leads me to my next question. What would you say that they could do to make the situation better?</br></br>


Caller: What they can do to make the situation better is that they can bring disinfectant to these poor inmates to use, to have. They can squirt it on their hands and use it everyday. The masks that they give out now and then, they don’t give them out all the time. The officers need to wear their masks on their faces; they need to disinfect themselves and they also need to wear PPE gloves and everything else constantly. You know, seeing people, they speak with people -- some have them and some don’t. Some officers don’t care, some officers do care.</br></br> 


UCI: Hm.</br></br>


Caller: You know? So, for as far as them doing something better than what they’re doing, I don’t see how they will because they never do.</br></br>


UCI: Hm. Okay, and what else do you want the people to know about your experience?</br></br>

Caller: Well, the experience here is, it’s more dangerous here than it is in society because COVID goes through our vents. So, if somebody has COVID, they cough, it’s coming through the vent, and every, every room is getting it. Every room is gonna get it. I wear a mask in my room; I wear it in my room because I know that the ventilation system is open like that, you know? And I feel like, you know, these here facilities are not fit to basically protect human beings from getting viruses like that of any kind. They need to look at the older individuals and get them out of there. Anybody with underlying health issues, they need to get them out.</br></br>


UCI: Mhm.</br></br>


Caller: Yeah.</br></br>

UCI: Well, thank you. Thank you so much, and very much, for participating in the PrisonPandemic. Please consider telling your friends about us and seeing if they would like to call in at any time.</br></br>


Caller: Oh, oh, excuse me. And also visiting. They only do an hour of visiting for people in the visiting room, but you know, it’s the same thing, you know?</br></br>


UCI: Mhm. Okay, well, thank you for that.</br></br>

Caller: Alright, no problem.</br></br>


UCI: Have a good night.</br></br>

Caller: You, too.
