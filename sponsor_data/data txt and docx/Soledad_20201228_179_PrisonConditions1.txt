Prison Conditions
I have to say that through it all I felt comforted. As strange as it sounds. From the moment the escorting C/O (correctional officer) came to get me, to the treatment within the TTA, then onced hosed in the gymand the way I was recieved my fellow inmates and even the way I was treated by staff. I say this as someone who does not walk in favor by custody in any prison I have been in and I have been incarcerated since 1994 as a juvenile lifer. A long process in learning to be amenable. Still I can tell you I was humbled at how well I was treated. Especially bythose I had previously treated so poorly through disdain. Here was the chance to get back (I thought) at me. They were professional and showed compassion instead. I definitely did not deserve to be treated humanely because of all that I have done and would have understood if they (staff or C/O’s) would haveacted accordingly.
