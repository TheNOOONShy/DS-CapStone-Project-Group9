This story was told by a person incarcerated at Colusa County Jail.</br></br>

UCI: You had mentioned you’re able to have court visitations. Have you had any problems related to COVID in that sense?</br></br>

Caller: Where? At court?</br></br>

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: No. No. They, at court, they take it very serious.</br></br>

They, as soon as you get to court, they provide you a mask. So, they take it more serious. Like, when you walk into the courtroom and the judge is in there the judge will make you wear a mask.</br></br>

But other than that, like the staff, at first - at first they weren’t – they were just like whatever. But, I feel like ever since I filed my habeas corpus like they’ve been trying to enforce the rules more like a little bit more serious. But like I tell them like they shouldn’t have to wait for somebody to say something about it, like they should be on it theirselves, you know I prefer.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>

Caller: Supplying us with like – the main thing is like they don’t supply us with no cleaning supplies throughout the day. Like, antibacterial. I know they have it, like antibacterial, like any type of [unintelligible] they have. A spray bottle that we could keep at least in the housing unit so we could spray off the phone, the sink, the toilet and the tables where we sit at. They don’t provide none of that.</br></br>

UCI: If you asked for it do you think they’d help you with it?</br></br>
 
Caller: Possibility, but they act like their job is so hard already. Like when you request for stuff like that, they just like tell you, “Yeah, on my next round,” or “Hold on, I’ll do it,” but they never do it. They won’t follow through with it.</br></br> 

So, like, it’ll already be time for us to lock it down and they’ll be like, “Oh, it’s already late. You only got like 10 minutes left,” or stuff like that.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>

Caller: Like right now, I requested. As soon as they let me out, I came out to my day room hours at 8:00 and I requested that the cleaning supplies I was like, “Can you give me a cleaning supplies, disinfectant?” She said she was gonna bring it but she never came through. Not like she’s gonna come bring it back on her next round.
