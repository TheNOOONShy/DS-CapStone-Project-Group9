Honestly things got hard for when in October 2020 I caught COVID-19. I was the first in my family to get the virus. Due to me being in shape and working out it didn't do much to me. I did everything I could not to get COVID. I wore gloves, mask, tried to social distance, but it's hard in here, social distance.</br></br> 

I cleaned everything, the phone and kiosk, everything, but still I contracted it. I felt all the symptoms. Couldn't smell and taste, short of breath, fever, I was crying. I thought the worst, sad. They just isolated me for two week, no medication, nothing just to bear with the pain.</br></br> 

Only person emailing was my wife morning, afternoon, and evening. Some days hour on the hour. Some days I was even scared to close my eyes thinking I wasn't going to wake up.</br></br>

I watch the news faithfully every day. A lot of healthy people died so I felt my days numbered. But I overcame it, I feel better today. But not soon after my wife and kids caught COVID-19.</br></br> 

It was heartbreaking knowing I couldn't help her nor our kids. I felt weak as a man. Crying and crying, begging the Lord to protect my family, and everyone recovered. We're all feeling better but the feeling of being distant, it hurts.</br></br> 

And I know the love between us has only grew strong and made us realize it's very lonely on both sides.
