This story was told by a person incarcerated at Calipatria.</br></br>

UCI: I'm so sorry. And have, you haven’t caught COVID, correct?</br></br>

Caller: So, see and this is another thing. Now I don’t wanna throw like no big ol’, sound like I’m a weird conspiracy theorist or somethin’ like that, but I feel like I’ve had COVID. I felt like I had it. But every time I’ve tested, I’ve, me personally, I have tested negative.</br></br> 

But I’ve felt like I’ve had it and there’s been people, that we know for a fact had it. And they said they lost they sense of smell. They know they they uh, they had the chills and things like that and uh, and they went to test and they came back negative so we like, are they testing who they wanna test? Or we’re like what’s goin’ on?</br></br> 

‘Cause we don’t, so for a minute, because they was doin’ all the stuff, we all said like we’re, people, we’re not gonna test for a little bit whatever the case may be. And then when we all test, we’re all negative, but then a test or two later, a positive will come up.</br></br> 

UCI: Yeah I’m sure that’s, that’s very confusing especially if you’re feeling symptoms or, or someone you know is feeling symptoms.</br></br> 

Caller: Exactly, that’s very confusing.
