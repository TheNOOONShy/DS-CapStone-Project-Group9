To PrisonPandemic Project,</br></br>

I received your short letter and request. Yes, I would like to give my experiences from inside of prisons during the pandemic.</br></br>

First, over a year ago when all this had gotten started we here as prisoners was isolated to the outside. Slowly but surely things came to a halt, no programs no yard for a while just a lot of cell time for chores at level three.</br></br>

After eight months inmates started testing positive either from their supervisor’s COs or somehow just tested positive for COVID-19. Secondly, the visit just stopped late March. I haven’t had a visit since until the video visits start in January for 30 minutes if the videos are working?</br></br>

When I found out I was positive for COVID-19 what a shock. How and when? What’s happened now? Will I be alright from this point? How can I call home saying I’m COVID-19 positive.</br></br>

Those who tested positive was moved to another yard only for 14 days if that then moved right back to the building they just came from days earlier. November 11th when I tested positive and still today, nothing but medical personnel comes through for temperature check, once a day, after two weeks of that, nothing.</br></br>

Finally, more needs to be done here. Thank you for your time and consideration.
