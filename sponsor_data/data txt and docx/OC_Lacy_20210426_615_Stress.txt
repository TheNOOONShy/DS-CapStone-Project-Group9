This story was told by a person incarcerated at OC Lacy.</br></br>Caller: But because the COVID thing, it’s just, it really doesn’t, it’s just like whatever now. You know? Cause I mean it’s been like what a year to change and it’s like we got used to it. We basically adapted on how to maneuver ourselves around and away from things like that.</br></br>Like to go to the store. We adapted to the new process of going to the store. We’ve adapted to the new process of ordering from like Uber Eats or Postmates, things like that. So we got used to not going out, things like that. But other than that, it’s not that bad.</br></br>UCI: Okay. And how have you been coping with the crisis while you are there?</br></br>Caller: How have I been coping with it?</br></br>UCI: Yes.</br></br>Caller: I just read a lot. I just read a lot of books. I really don’t pay attention to what is going on. I really don’t, honestly, I really don’t pay attention to what other people are doing because then it’s not, none of my concern what other people are doing.</br></br> As long as they don’t bother me, I just want them to leave me alone. And about the pandemic thing, since none of us have it, I’m just, honestly, I’m just scared that my family is going to catch it and get sick. Because I don’t want my family to get sick.</br></br>UCI: Mhm.</br></br>Caller: I mean I honestly don’t want nobody around me to get sick because then I’m going to have to be careful, extra careful not to get sick. So, that’s it.</br></br>UCI: Okay. That sounds good. And what else did you want the people to know about your experience?
