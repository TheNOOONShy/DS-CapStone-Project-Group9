<em>This story was told by a person incarcerated at Orange County Central Men's Jail.</br></br></em>

UCI: And so, going back to my question earlier about mental health, how has your family handled not being able to visit or talk to you during this time?</br></br>

Caller: They’ve been very stressed out and depressed as well, not knowing what's happening to us.</br></br>

UCI: So has there been no form of communication, or how, have you been able to communicate with your loved ones at all during this year.</br></br>

Caller: We’ve had phone calls they gave us towards the, towards the middle of that outbreak, they gave us two five minute phone calls, that we could call. Otherwise our family had to pay for the phone call.</br></br>

UCI: What could have made the situation better for you and your loved one?</br></br>

Caller: I don’t know.</br></br>

UCI: And I see, and in terms of your facility, is there anything you could see as like a glaring thing that needs to be improved?</br></br>

Caller: Cleanliness, they should have somebody besides just the inmates cleaning the facility with subpar cleaning supplies.</br></br> 

UCI: I see.</br></br>

Caller: Not once have they ever come in here and cleaned it thoroughly, a good cleaning. Not just spray solution on things and walk away.</br></br>

UCI: And what else do you want people to know about your experience?</br></br>

Caller: It's a place where grown men cry.</br></br>

UCI: I see. Well thank you so much for sharing, that's all the questions I have but if you have like anything else to say now would be the time to do so. Like anything in general about your experience, if not that's okay too.</br></br> 

Caller: I hope things change for us here, where we get a chance to be productive, in this society again. I hope we're not thrown away. I hope people realize that people live here for years and years.</br></br> 

That's one thing I never understood. Why they wanna throw people away and not give them a chance. The word rehabilitation doesn’t apply.</br></br>

UCI: I see, well I really appreciate you sharing your experiences. And that's why we do these kinds of things, to make sure the general public are aware of what's going on inside these facilities. Is there anything else you would like to talk about?</br></br>

Caller: No, I'm sorry, thank you very much for this-</br></br>

UCI: No, of course.</br></br>

Caller: For this opportunity.</br></br>

UCI: So, thank you very much for participating in prison pandemic and please consider telling your friends about us and seeing if they would-</br></br>

Caller: Yes.</br></br>

UCI: Like to call in.</br></br>

Caller: Thank you.</br></br>

UCI: Thank you, have a good one!</br></br>

Caller: You too, bye.</br></br>

UCI: Bye.
