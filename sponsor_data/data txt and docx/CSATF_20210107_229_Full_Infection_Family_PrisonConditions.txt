To whom it may concern,</br></br> 

I received your most welcomed letter. Please bear with my print, I am using it because I am not sure if you could read my handwriting, I use a lot of loops in it. Now to your questions, I caught Covid-19. It was scary at first, I worked as a porter in a building where they housed inmates and that is where I contracted the virus.</br></br>

At first the officers only had one block set aside for isolation, 100 cells. I worked it from Feb 2020 until Dec 7, 2020. That is when I and over 300 inmates caught the virus, they do move you to another block for positive inmates and make you take a celly.</br></br>

Most of the time you do not even know them, and you are both in a cell sick for 14-21 days together. In no way did I ever feel safe in the way they did things. The officers allowed other positive inmates to serve chow.</br></br>

They did not want kitchen workers to get sick. This is how the virus spread in my opinion. I could tell you much more, but I doubt my letter would make it to you. </br></br>

We have a platform for media if you would like to email. Look into it if you like, we have been given video visits. I got one on 1-2-21, So nice I must say. </br></br>

My wife and family use to come see me twice a month until my wife caught cancer last year and had to go through her whole chemo treatment while I have been locked down. The last years video visit was a blessing; I have felt so far from her during this troubling time.
</br></br>

It has been so difficult, if not for being able to email, I might not have made it all mentally. We have been treated as if this is a lockdown due to our bad behavior, and not because of a virus. We will let us see if this makes it to you. </br></br>

Would not be surprised if it does not make it you. With that said I will try and call the number that you sent me. Take care and thank you for your concern.</br></br> 

Respectfully.
