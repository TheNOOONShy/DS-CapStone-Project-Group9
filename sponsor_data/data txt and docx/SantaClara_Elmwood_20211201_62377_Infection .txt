This story was told by a person incarcerated at Elmwood Correctional Facility.</br></br>

UCI: Oh yeah. Thank you for sharing. How has the vaccination situation been like?</br></br>

Caller: I have a double Moderna shot, and I was still leaking through that. So I’m curious to see what CDC would think of that. So I signed up for a booster – watching the news and trying to keep up with it, you know.</br></br>

So this weekend probably Saturday morning or maybe even late Friday night, which would be Saturday morning pretty much – I’ll get a booster. But that doesn’t mean they have their homework done for the new variant. It just means that they’re trying to say it helps.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, definitely. Do you feel as though the facility has done a good job of explaining to you guys what the vaccine is?</br></br>

Caller: The facility [unintelligible] explaining it?</br></br>

UCI: Oh yeah. Or like for individuals who are thinking about getting the vaccine, do you feel like the facility has given them enough information to make that decision?</br></br>

Caller: I think it’s been like basically they're assuming we’re been watching the news enough or reading newspapers – there’s newspapers per unit so. If you asked them, person to person – [unintelligible], they do have an opinion but they really - they don’t say, “Hey we want you to get this.”</br></br>

They kind of just believe – that they got plenty to do than just advise us like that. They assume we’re educated and trying to educate each other between our peoples, you know?
