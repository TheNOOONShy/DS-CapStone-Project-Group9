Hi,</br></br> 


Thank you PrisonPandemic for writing to us prisoners. When I received your letter I got very happy. I did not expect it, it is beautiful that you guys care about us and thank you for that PrisonPandemic website and address. Well it’s being difficult and hard with that COVID-19 here in prison, this institution had a lot of positives of COVID.</br></br> 


But now it is less now, they had offer the vaccines for who ever wanted. I took my two vaccines back in February. Like I said it’s being hard, like I have and been depressed. I think that COVID affected a lot of us with our mental health. But here there are good doctors that help us deal, cope with our depression, etc.</br></br> 

Here at this facility we have good experienced psychologist. They helpful. At the middle of this pandemic one of my uncles die of COVID he pass away. I was very sad. Me right now i'm in quarantine again because I felt little bit sick. But I’m ok. But like I said we are getting help here with mental health doctors. So we copin day by day.</br></br> 


Thank you, really I don’t have much to say but if you want to put something good in your website about this institution they are helping us at RJD “A” facility that's where I’m at. Thank you for caring about us. I hope and wish good luck to you and your team. Thank you and God Bless you.</br></br> 


Sincerely,
