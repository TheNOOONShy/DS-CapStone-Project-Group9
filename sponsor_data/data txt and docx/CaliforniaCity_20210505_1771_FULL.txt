Hello my name is [redacted]. Well I would like to tell you something about me in the process of the COVID-19 pandemic. Approximately a year ago all the people began to get sick from the COVID-19 virus. They passed through a quarantine process and later were transferred to other buildings.</br></br>


Later on my celly and I began to feel headaches. We thought that it was the results of the flu, and we also began to feel pain in our bones.After, we also began to feel goosebumps and kept on feeling sick throughout the week. I personally did not think it was COVID-19 until one morning the nurses took our temperatures, and asked us how we were feeling.</br></br>


I took the liberty of letting them know that I did not feel well. So she told us that she will be conduct a COVID-19 test. After 15 minutes she came back and said, I’m sorry you both are positive. At that instant I felt sad and discouraged and began asking God for another opportunity to live.</br></br>


 After two days I was feeling better. Slowly but surely, eventually and finally everything came back to normal in my life. I also want to let you know another face of the virus. I think that virus penetrated through the vents of the cells, which are shared among other cells.</br></br>


I also believe that there was a lot of people who did not use the mask while being mandated, including, workers and staff members who come from the outside of the facility (I’m pretty sure you will understand who they are, however I can not say who exclusively). I also want to inform you that inmates are locked down 22 hours a day, this means we are in our cells 98% of the time of the day. However little by little some places have been re-open.</br></br>


Unfortunately some of our members lost their lives. But God is great and does not forget us, ever. I will like to thank you for the care you have for us, I think that is very good from your part.</br></br>


Well I think this is all for now. I was able to tell you something about me from inside the prison. I will like to say with all my heart that its people like you that show us love. To us that helps us keep on going, and its a very good gesture from your part. I think this is it for today. I hope you have a beautiful day and that may God bless you.</br></br>


Thank you
