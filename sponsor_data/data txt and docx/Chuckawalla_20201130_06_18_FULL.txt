This story was told by a person incarcerated at Chuckawalla.</br></br>

UCI: And what is the current COVID-19 situation at your facility?</br></br>

Caller: Right now, the outbreak - we had a, we've had a couple outbreaks, but it's starting to - the numbers are starting to go down.</br></br> 

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>

Caller: As far as I know, I think that we only have 70 cases left.</br></br>

UCI: Okay, and what is going okay? Or what is going well within the facility?</br></br>

Caller: Oh. What's going well?</br></br>

UCI: Yeah. Like, are they doing, are they like following protective like protocol like wearing masks and like hand sanitizer and all of that?</br></br>

Caller: They seem to be doing a lot more of that now. They weren't before, you know, all the outbreaks that we had. It didn't seem like anybody was taking it serious.</br></br>

Especially the officers. They, they would interact and talk to people. They just didn't take it very seriously.</br></br>

But now they are, they're required to wear surgical masks. They can no longer wear, you know, their issued or purchased face masks.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>

Caller: Now they're required to wear the surgical masks. But they didn't do that before. And I think we've had three or four outbreaks, and this is the third outbreak, I think.</br></br> 

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>

Caller: And it just doesn't seem like it's gone real well.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: So, we were in the last yard. We're on Delta yard. We're the last yard, and all the other yards had basically gotten it at the same time. Which is four other yards.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>

Caller: They had the outbreak, they basically quarantined them over there. And then they had a second outbreak on C yard. What they did is they emptied one of our buildings. We have three buildings on our yard.</br></br> 

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br> 

Caller: They emptied one of our buildings, which is D-11. And they used that as quarantine. However, when a building gets infected, which there's about 192 individuals in this box.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br> 

Caller: I call it a box cause that's what it is.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah.</br></br> 

Caller: And there's no social distancing. It's just impossible. We're only - the most we can usually be in our cubes, and stay apart is three feet.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br> 

Caller: So, they emptied D-11, and when they have a positive case, they automatically move that positive case to D-11. And then they take everyone else in the building, and they spread them out through the prison. They put them in education, the classrooms where they emptied it out and put beds in. They put them in family visiting.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: Basically, when they do that, they're, they're, they've increased, you can see it. The numbers increase rapidly.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br> 

Caller: It seems, I'm not saying, and I don't really know if they are. But it seems like they're purposely trying to infect people. Because common sense says if you take people in the building and then you consolidate them and put them into smaller rooms, less well ventilated. I mean, this thing is pretty much in the air when you talk, and you breathe, and you sleep.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah.</br></br> 

Caller: And these areas were not very good. But not only that, now you're sick.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br> 

Caller: I was sick. My own personal experience was I was sent to central health. It, it was horrible. When I went to central health, it's like being locked up in the hole.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br> 

Caller: You're punished. And you're put in there, and then the food is 10 times worse. You get less portions.</br></br>

So here you are sick with COVID and, or here I am sick with COVID and my body is basically, you know, pushing all the food out. I can't hold much down. They're giving us less portions. It was smaller portions, but it wasn't just that. It was like the nurses, not all of them, there were some good ones.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br> 

Caller: But majority of the nurses were just going through the motions. They didn't even listen to what you had to say. For instance, I got, I was in there Tuesday by Thursday, they had taken, taken X-rays of my chest cause I was coughing so bad.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br> 

Caller: But nobody ever came and told me or diagnosed or, or followed up, that I had ammonia in my lungs. So, Thursday, they took the X-rays. Friday, they made me move. I had all my property. They make you pack all your property up, which is heavy.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br> 

Caller: Bulky. And here I have ammonia in my lungs, and they're making me move across what they call the oval room. Which is a good distance.</br></br> 

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br> 

Caller: So, I didn't think nothing of it. I just moved and did what I was told. That, that evening, I felt okay, but by, so that was Thursday. Friday, I started deteriorating. By Sunday, my oxygen level was falling down to 83 percent, and I had 103.5 temperature.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br> 

Caller: They sent me out to the hospital. I spent seven days in the hospital, where they pretty much saved my life.</br></br> 

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br> 

Caller: And then, they - on the seventh day, they discharged me with certain conditions. I had to, they had to check my blood sugar levels because of all the steroids they were giving me. My blood sugar levels were really high. And they also had, they were supposed to monitor me through the night for my oxygen levels.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br> 

Caller: So, I came back to the prison, and none of that happened. Even though I repeatedly told the nurses that this was the condition.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: This is what, this is the problem. And they didn't listen. Instead, they sent me back here to D-11, the quarantine building.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br> 

Caller: And I was dizzy. And then they put me on an upper bunk, and I tried to talk to the officers. The officers were really cool about it. They let me sit on the lower bunk.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br> 

Caller: But it was just the fact that they, by the rules, that I had to be on an upper bunk. I was really dizzy.</br></br> 

UCI: Yeah.</br></br> 

Caller: I didn't get my blood sugar levels checked until Wednesday, but I pushed it. I had to push it and push it and push it.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br> 

Caller: Until finally, I had to go to one of the head nurses, and they, they basically got me into medical and got me, got my blood sugar levels checked. 'Cause it, it just seemed like it was a fiasco.</br></br>

I don't think that you should be moving people when they're extremely sick like that.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah. I'm sorry. That sounds like a very difficult situation.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, it was not. I mean, I'm fine now.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br> 

Caller: But I just couldn't believe it.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: Believe how they were handling it. One thing I will say when I got to D-11, they do two checks per day. And they bring a force of like, I don't know, I didn't really count. I think it's like nine or 10 nurses in, and they're taking your - that was really good.</br></br>

I thought that that was very important, but again, you're getting more medical attention when you're in D-11 than you are in central health. Which is supposed to be the trauma center for the prison.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: And not only that, you can move around better in D-11 than you can in central health. I just think that they need to change that whole thing when you're in central health. They're saying they're monitoring you, but there's no difference between you being in D-11 or central health, except it feels like more of a punishment.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah. So, what would make the situation at your facility better?</br></br>

Caller: I'm sorry.</br></br>

UCI: What would make the situation at your facility better?</br></br>

Caller: They really need to have, I think they need to have some experts from the street, real medical professionals from the street.</br></br>  

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br> 

Caller: Not CDCR medical professionals come in and assess the situation. Because moving people around when you have COVID, a very deadly disease it, is no joke.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah. Mm-hmm.</br></br>

Caller: I don't know if you've had it or you've known somebody that's had it but, but it almost got me. And I exercise every day, I'm healthy.</br></br> 

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, of course, I have a bad history of using drugs in the past, but it's been 10 years. And it's still, I never thought in a million years it would get me.</br></br> 

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br> 

Caller: And I really didn't think it would.</br></br> 

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: But it, it's something that I don't think a lot of people, including here, because we're in a remote, rural area they're not taking it super serious.</br></br> 

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: Even with the, the deaths. It's preventative. I think a lot of things could be preventative. Meaning that the medical staff, they need more staff.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br> 

Caller: They need more medical experts onsite when these outbreaks happen so they can address the issues of trying to prevent you from deteriorating when you're sick.</br></br>

UCI: Right.</br></br>

Caller: These conditions that they put us in, it's like an incubation.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br> 

Caller: I mean, the air is horrible. I work for the maintenance crew, so I know how the airflow works here. I've worked back there for several years. And the airflow, these machines, they don't work correctly.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br> 

Caller: They're broken, and they're old, and they're out of date, and they can't get the right parts, so they just make them work. Well, they're working is not pulling in fresh air from the outside it's mainly, you know, all recycled air.</br></br> 

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br> 

Caller: Which increases the risk of infection.</br></br> 

UCI: Yeah.</br></br> 

Caller: So, I think that's another thing they need to look at the air situation, and they need to reduce the population. I mean, we're, it's 192 people in here. It's impossible to social distance it's just not possible. If somebody came in through the camera, they would see exactly what I mean.</br></br>

UCI: All right. And how has the COVID-19 situation at your facility affected your loved ones?</br></br>

Caller: It really affected them. It hit them hard because, for four days, I was pretty much incoherent.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br> 

Caller: I just really couldn't get up, and they had no idea what was going on.</br></br>
 
UCI: Yeah.</br></br> 

Caller: They had no idea that I was even in the hospital when I was in the hospital until they finally got a hold of somebody here. I don't know exactly what happened.</br></br> 

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br> 

Caller: But it really shook them up because they didn't really think nobody in my family has been affected, so they didn't really know how serious it was.</br></br>

UCI: I'm very sorry to hear that.</br></br>

Caller: It's okay. We're through it. It's not your fault.</br></br> 

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: It was one hell of a journey though.</br></br>

UCI: I'm glad you made it out and that you're healthy and good now. What has it been like for you to have reduced visitation and programming?</br></br>

Caller: It's been horrible. We've been completely cut off from the world.</br></br>
 
UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br> 

Caller: The only thing we have is these phone calls and letters and pictures.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: You see, not just me, but you see lots of people and their demeanors, and also because the programs and the rehabilitations have been shut down, you just see people kind of start to deteriorate into a negative state of mind.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br> 
 
Caller: We're just cut off from everything, and our loved ones really are what uphold us.</br></br>

UCI: Right.</br></br> 

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br> 
 
Caller: And visits that we get or even the face-to-face contact really gives that intimate bond.</br></br>

Caller: The loss of that really has an impact on our lives.</br></br> 

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: It's just that they have not created something sooner.</br></br>

UCI: So, how have you been coping with the crisis?</br></br>

Caller: Just dealing with the punches as they come. You know they, we're pretty much powerless except for certain remedies that are given. I just adapt and try to deal with it the best way I can. I take advantage of what they do give us.</br></br>

UCI: Okay. And we only have a minute left, so is there anything else you'd like to share about your experience?</br></br>

Caller: No. I just want to thank you and everyone there for taking the time to do what you're doing.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, thank you so much for participating in PrisonPandemic. You know, we are thinking about you out here, and we hope that you take care. I'm not sure if you know about our P.O. box.</br></br>

Caller: Yes, I do.</br></br>

UCI: Okay. Yeah, feel free to send us anything, and please consider telling your friends about us and seeing if they would like to call in as well.</br></br>

Caller: Okay. I will definitely keep that in mind.
