This story was told by a person incarcerated at New Creek.</br></br>Caller: I’m at New Creek State Prison. For the last year, since this virus has hit the prison, it’s been hard on a lot of us here. Lately me and some other guys got the virus back to back to back. It really took a toll on me.</br></br>It made me a better person to see how life really is to me and other people, you know. I’m always helping people. I’m always taking care of people and all of the inmates in here. I’m just trying to stay happy.</br></br>You know, keep people positive, keep warning them about washing their hands, keep their stuff clean and stuff in here. Like the prison I’m at, we have microwaves and we have to keep that very clean each and every time we use it. We wipe it down and sanitize it. Same thing with the water faucet and these phones we use here.</br></br>But for the main thing, we had a big outbreak and we got over it here and we’re doing pretty good right now, you know. We had a thing about phase two where that we go in groups of like eight people, four times a week. </br></br>You know, we have little activities for adult contact. We keep social distance. We walk in a canteen now, instead of them bringing it to us. So things have been looking better for us, you know.</br></br>There’s a lot of guys here still, they still want to know about the virus, what’s going on about it, and different viruses coming out like Johnson & Johnson. So, what we’re doing is that we’ve been stuff from newsletters from prison office and we’ve been [unintelligible] and keeping it going on.</br></br>But other than that, it’s hard, it’s at bad times, but we’re still making the best of it, you know. Each and every day I thank my blessings. You know, I’m alive, I’m healthy. You know, when I got it, I kept with them for about two months, but after that, I got back on track.</br></br>Other than that, I’m hoping everybody’s safe in here and out there. You know, each one teach one. When I got this letter, I don’t think of it, you know, I draw somewhat. My drawings are pretty good.</br></br>I could sell one of my drawing or something like that but I don’t. But I could share one of my drawings. It’s called the “Goodness of Times.” I draw some people and stuff and bad times and good times, you know, so other than that I thank God for the time and things like that, you know. I appreciate it, you know.</br></br>UCI:  Yeah, definitely send out your drawing. How has the vaccination situation been like at your facility?</br></br>Caller: Right now, we are way over half right now, the population right now. We did some shots today. We did 85 shots today. We right now, we doing right now, this prison is that we getting the people who had better shoes and stuff.</br></br>Now, they have to wait 90 days to get vaccinated so when time is up, they get their first shot. I say, up here where I’m at, we got like maybe 25, 40 people left in the yard I’m on right now, for the whole yard to be vaccinated. They’ve been doing a good job at New Creek. They’ve been doing a real good job, you know.</br></br>Staff is taking care of us very well. People like to know and we’ve been working with them and stuff. Staff is getting their shots and stuff so the main thing is a lot of inmates have been wondering like, “Okay, well staff don’t have to get shots, why do we have to get shots?”</br></br>You know, my thing is that we ain’t them and they ain’t us. You know, we have to look out for one another. You know, it’s coming in, but with the vaccination, it helps slow stuff down and for a lot of guys that took their shots, you know, they want it, but they’re doing it. They give us opportunity to make it up.</br></br>Say that three or four people refuse like two or three months ago, well they got another chance of signing up again and getting it again, you know. So, it’s a blessing to do that. It’s really really a blessing. It’s been helping a lot of people.</br></br>The outbreak was pretty bad here at New Creek if you heard about it. It was pretty bad here, you know. It put some people down. Some good friends of mine. But yeah, you know, I’m working through it. Every day I count my blessing, you know.</br></br>UCI: How has the covid situation affected your loved ones?</br></br>Caller: Bad. You know, every time I call home, they worried about me. You know, I keep myself clean, I wash my clothes. You know, take care of my hygiene and stuff like that.</br></br>I’m in a crew up here where that we clean and we sanitize exercise equipments every day. I’m out from like six in the morning until like four in the evening until I walk back down for count. Then go back out around 4:45 all the way until seven o’clock.</br></br>You know, so I’m up there sanitizing the benches, the weight bars, the door handles. Anything metal or steel or whatever’s around the yard, we sanitize it. We go around every 30 minutes to an hour to do it, you know, so we keep everything clean. A lot, you know.</br></br>UCI: How have you been coping with everything?</br></br>Caller: I stay positive. I try to stay positive by reading about it. Sometimes I go to the dorm by myself and my music and I cry and I think about things. You know, I get myself back to reality, you know.</br></br>Right now, this facility that I’m on right now is at level two. It’s one of the best level two in Southern California. A lot of guys can agree to it, you know. You hear a lot of violence, a lot of people look out for one another.</br></br>But one thing I do notice is that when the virus hit, a lot of people got together and started helping others out. And that, you don’t really see that in prisons. I don’t care where you at, you really don’t see that. In here, everybody stepped up and help each other out, you know.</br></br>If you didn’t have something and you need it, they gave it to you. Cosmetics, food to eat or stuff like that, you know. So, it’s pretty resting that everyone came together.</br></br>From Monday up until today, we had a walkathon everyday from 8:30 to 11:30 for yard time. Each yard is three buildings so, each building had a chance to do their own thing each day. I got blessed to come up with that idea “Let’s have a walkathon for our victims”. Since we can’t have guests, we did it on our own.</br></br>We did it on our own, so it was a blessing. I had praise from the captain and everybody’s like you did a good job. And I’m like “Look, I’m just doing what’s right. I told the guys when you jog, think of your victims. You know, each step you do is in remembrance of your victims.</br></br>You know, I got like three victims and I did 15 laps you know. I did 15 laps, you know. Five after each victim, you know. So, it was pretty good. We talked about it with a moment of silence before we left and broke up.</br></br>So, I’m trying to stay positive. That keep me in the right track by helping people doing the right thing.</br></br>You can ask me any questions. I’m open. I’m like a book, I’m open at times. Whatever you need to know or whatever you ask me, I will answer it for you. But I appreciate this interview. I really appreciate it.</br></br>UCI: Is there anything else that you’d like to say or anything else you want people to know about your experience?</br></br>Caller: I think I’d like to let people know that we just like working together as a team, helping each other. Though we come to obstacles like this virus, we can do it together. We can defeat this virus, you know. We really can, you know.</br></br>By washing your hands constantly, social distancing, keep your masks on. Here, they’re very strict on the masks. If you go outside, and your mask is not on, they gonna write you up for it.</br></br>Because that’s something that everybody need to realize. That hey this is something very serious. It can kill you, you know. Like I said, this prison is very very good, they’re very strict on stuff but it’s still helping us out.</br></br>I just gotta say stay safe, you know, stay safe. And I will send a drawing to ya’ll pretty soon. I’ll send a couple drawings and stuff. </br></br>UCI: Great, thank you so much for participating in PrisonPandemic and calling in today. Please feel free to write to us, to keep calling, tell your friends or anyone they can write to us if they don’t want to call. We’re open either way. And make sure to send us any drawings when you have time.</br></br>Caller: I got a lot of guys here to draw some of you guys. We have artists in here and when I showed them this, they said “Well, we could do something.” And I said “Yeah man, these people willing to help us out and put our story out there. The least we can is donate drawings to them. Let people see our artwork out there.”</br></br>I’ve got like three or four guys, you know, I got my second letter from one of the professors there and I’m gonna write and let her know that I got these guys willing. All I wanna question, you know, is make sure that the drawings, can they donate it? Can it go to donations when I send it to ya’ll? Or where would it go? Mainly stuff like that could be donations, you know.</br></br>UCI: I’ll definitely mention that, but as far as I know, it should just be posted online and everything. And everything is not going to disclose anyone’s name or anything.</br></br>Caller: Okay, I appreciate it. Thank you.
