Hello UCI,</br></br>

This letter is from High Desert State Prison.</br></br>

Regarding the Pandemic, I can not complain. I tested positive for the virus, but I did not experience any symptoms. The nurses and correctional staff acted professionally. I can not claim I went through it, it would be untrue.</br></br> 

I did lose my mom, bro, sis to the virus. Mom would have wanted me to move forward. I believe my positive thinking has helped me through these troubling times. I do try my hardest to avoid negatism.</br></br> 
 
I wish to discuss the quarantine, I do not mind it, it prevents the virus from escaping. Also, I agree with prolonging all visits.</br></br> 

The pandemic hasn't stopped from spreading, so why change it. I believe the safety of all beings comes first. If you were to ask me- there are many impatient people. I think we should stay on the modified program, for as long as it takes for the pandemic to pass from sight.</br></br>

I must confess, not too many inmates showed symptoms. Even though I tested positive for the virus I never stopped exercising. How great is that?</br></br>

Well, I am not trying to take up your time, I hope the above will answer your curiosity about my character. I keep it honest. Last but not least, sincerely appreciate your concern for my well-being, with that said, I close this letter for you now.
