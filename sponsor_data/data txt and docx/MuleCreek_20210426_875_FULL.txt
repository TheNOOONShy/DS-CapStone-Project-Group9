PrisonPandemic,</br></br>After six and a half years struggling to establish a scientology prison outreach study group at a maximum security facility (circa 2014-2020), the COVID panic put a full stop to all rehabilitation activities early March 2020. Hardly anyone believed COVID believed COVID warranted any alarm and consequently all of us (custody staff and prisoners alike) carried on as usual, and social distancing.</br></br>Of course the education department was closed, as were all the vocational training shops.  The religious department activities were suspended indefinitely, despite the first amendment protections. Enhanced Out Patient (EOP) mental health groups were cancelled from March to October 2020 causing a significant increase in mental health crisis (suicide attempts, staff assaults, etc.).</br></br>All other rehabilitative groups promoting cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) were shut down as well. And all the while the medical department accepted self-admitted opiate addiction claims for a newly introduced Suboxone treatment program. That was what alarmed me most of all in the beginning of 2020 before the COVID panic closed the visiting room-drug route.</br></br>Vides under the guise of rehabilitation, the medical department made Suboxone available to nearly anyone claiming an opiate addiction who wanted treatment without understanding the life-long registration requirement for documented drug addicts after paroling from prison. I remember making a joke about the next thing the medical department will promote will be a needle exchange program.</br></br>By the summer of 2020, there were so many Suboxone patients lining up for their free high that the regular yard schedule would be delayed every morning, hour, and night until the medication line was done.</br></br>With so many new justice reform laws being passed which benefit prisoners, I suspected this new drug treatment was intended to generate greater numbers of patients needed to justify hiring new medical staff as a sort of coup d’état paradigm shift usurping the control of CDCR.</br></br>I’d noticed that custody staff were more and more often powerless to govern day to day matters involving prisoners. Accountability for the ensuing year of chaos resorted to custody staff blaming the medical department while the medical department staff act stupid and claim that all the arbitrary program changes were initiated by Sacramento bureaucrats.</br></br>All the while this chaos frustrated everyone, except the Suboxone patients enjoying their free highs without the inconvenience of work assignments or CBT rehab programs to bother with. I was amongst many at the maximum security facility who were transferred to a medium security facility in order to make room for a quarantine unit per Sacramento bureaucrats orders.</br></br>This transfer seemed to have been perceived as a threat and prompted custody staff at receiving facilities to harass the new arrivals and place them in compromising situations housing them with incompatible cellmates who resented integrating with higher custody prisoners. There were also situations where a number of prisoners were housed in the gym, previously ruled unconstitutional (see Plata v. Coleman v. Schwarzenegger etc.).</br></br>Where rising tensions in an already frustrating year resulted in a number of assaults and one suicide that I know of here. As mentioned earlier, custody staff and medical staff alike were hostile and unsympathetic to all these inconveniences.</br></br>Consequently, the number of Rule Violation Reports (RVR’s) increased exponentially, along with corresponding staff assaults, cell-fights, cell murders, suicide attempts, etc. It would be interesting to discover the statistics regarding staff assaults, cell fights murder suicides etc. for a three-year period preceding COVID compared to those recorded in 2020-2021.</br></br>
