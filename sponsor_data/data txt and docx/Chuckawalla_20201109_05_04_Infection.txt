UCI: How have you been coping?</br></br>Caller: I'm doing - I got very sick. I got pretty sick. I lost my sense of smell. I still haven't had my sense of smell back for six months, so that worries me. I'm worried about getting sick again because I'm almost 60 now. And it was rough the first two days.</br></br>It was pretty rough because I had chills and body aches, and I had a cough for a long time. But I'm all better now. But I'm just hoping that I don't get it again. And I'm trying to do everything I can to stay away from it.
