This story was told by a person incarcerated at Soledad.</br></br>

Caller: Okay, thank you. I would like to talk about the social distancing attempting to conduct throughout the California Department of Corrections. They have reduced the population down quite a bit. And they certainly need to continue doing that because, speaking for myself, the yard I live on now is currently nothing but dorms. We have nobody in cells here. This is a level one facility. We have six dorms here. And currently, they have the bunks separated by six feet each.</br></br> 

And the problem, though, is we're sharing the same facilities, the bathrooms, there's 10 toilets for the entire dorm population that are shared. Actually, it's eight toilets and 10 sinks if my counts is remembered correctly. And everyone is sharing these common areas, you know, the air into enclosed bathroom, there's no windows, so certainly not the best circulation and some of them the exhaust fan doesn't even work, so there is no circulation.</br></br> 

So, it's really a bad situation if the COVID were to come back. We've had it on this facility once already in one of the dorms and thankfully it didn't spread beyond the one dorm but, boy, we needed the population out of there. So, and we're going into winter now, so I'm a little worried about that knowing that this virus is liable to come back maybe tenfold.</br></br> 

We don't know how this pandemic works in the wintertime. But we saw what it could do in the summer and it wasn't nice. They took over a dozen guys out of here at least that were positive with that stuff. So, that was just in one dorm. I'm pretty sure it was many more than that, but I don't have an exact number for you. I know it was at least that.</br></br> 

My point I wanted to make, though, is they're trying to come up with ways to reduce the population, the governor, Governor Newsom has stood fast told the public that he will not release any convicted felons with a violent- what's deemed a violent felony. And this is just ludicrous. You've got guys in these level one facilities that have a life term, who have been multiple times designated by various psychologists to be a low risk. Low risk not just of future violence but low risk recidivism.</br></br>

Most of us, I'll speak for myself again here. I've been in the system for 40 years. I came in in 1980. And I've been assessed repeatedly since 1982 by their psychologists and I've always gotten an assessment as low risk of violence. I had no prior criminal history and all that and I have no disciplinary history inside the prison system since 35 years now, it's been since it was 1986 was the last time I was written up for anything. And there was no violence of any time since I've been in here.</br></br>

So, and I've been to the parole board, granted parole three times and the governor has reversed it three times. Come on, I'm not alone on this. There's hundreds of us guys in here in the same situation. We're elderly, in general, we're pretty old guys. Why are we not being considered? I don't understand. This is the ideal. We're the ones most susceptible to this COVID thing. We're generally over 60 years old. We have these low risk assessments.</br></br> 

Statistically, we have no recidivism rate whatsoever. So, what is it the governor is pointing to here? Other than political interests, which shouldn't be a part of the consideration here. What's he thinking? What is it? That's the question a lot of guys in here have. I don't know how aware you are. They have a lot of us lifers in these level ones now. We've been assessed by the state, by the prison system to not be a risk. So, we're at the minimum security facilities just waiting. And we're not on the list. We're not being considered for any of this population reduction. It's ludicrous. And this is what I wanted to pass along.</br></br> 

UCI: How have you been dealing with this with COVID, like how have you felt about it?</br></br> 

Caller: Well, it's not the best of times when you don't have visiting. And I do have a very, my mother, she passed in 2008. And I do have a father who is very elderly. He isn't gonna be with us much longer and that's very frustrating not being able to go out to the visiting. We haven't had visiting since March, I believe. There's nothing we can look to in the future that might change on this.</br></br> 

So, we haven't heard anything anyway. So, that's rough. He's been at my side, so to speak, for all these last 40 years of incarceration. So, we are close as we can be considering we've been separated for so long by prison walls. But yeah, it does amplify the isolation I gotta say.</br></br> 

And it's not helping your family out there either. I mean, they're going through the same thing. Particularly, being in one of those places where there's a convalescent situation where they're isolated and have risk of this COVID. It makes you sit in this idle time in here. There's no programs. You get plenty of idle time.</br></br> 

They've got everything shut down. There's no vocations, there's no self-help groups. No, not even AA. There's nothing. You just have to sit here and wait this out and twiddle your thumbs and think about your family, I guess. So, yeah, it's not an easy situation, in any way you want to look at it.</br></br> 

UCI: Do you have any thoughts about what could be done to make- what could be done to make your facility better right now?</br></br>

Caller: Well, you know, I understand the caution and the program changes or the program termination, however you want to look at it, because of COVID. I get that we need to brace ourselves for that possibility. I mean, it's come through this yard once already and it's very likely it'll come through again in the wintertime.</br></br> 

So, I get why the visiting is closed. I could say, you know, I'm a little weary to make such a suggestion, but it would be helpful if we could telecommunicate with family, to just be able to see them. But I also understand that in the long term the state has habits of making things that are convenient for them become the norm.</br></br> 

And I by no means would want to encourage a situation where the televisits became the norm even after COVID was long gone. So, it's kind of hard to bring yourself to make such a suggestion, you know what I mean.</br></br>

UCI: I mean, what could go wrong in just making a suggestion?</br></br>

Caller: Well, I mean, we would benefit in the short term now if they were to actually implement it, it would be great. What if they decided they want to keep it that way forever and, you know, then just terminate having the contact visit? That would not be what anybody wants. Cause that's just not the same. It's just not the same.</br></br>

UCI: Is there anything else that you want people to know about?</br></br>

Caller: Wow. This is a 15-minute call. Well, you know, I wish they could come up internally, this is what your question is going to inside the system, it would really be nice if they made more of an effort to institute some kind of programming for guys to go on doing some kind of something other than sitting idle in here, like the self-help groups.</br></br> 

Oh, man, so many lifers in particular who are still going to board telephonically. They're not going to any self-groups, they're not able to self-improve in any meaningful way sitting idle staring across the dorm, and another guy, 24 hours a day. So, that's kind of just, you know, I see some guys come back with denied paroles and that just didn't have to be the case.</br></br> 

There's just, they're just not being exposed to programming that could help them learn some tools to, you know, look inside themselves and do some exploring and understand what brought them to prison. I know this stuff because I facilitated groups myself prior to COVID shutdown.</br></br> 

So, it's a little extra frustrating to myself because I was running these groups. But I get how much they helped these guys. I've seen these guys come through these groups, especially, particularly, these minimum.</br></br>

And they come up out of their parole hearings with some pretty good results, you know, just takes a little bit of self-exploration. And they're not getting that now. So, it just doesn't seem to me anything positive is coming out of this lack of programming. That's a big one.
