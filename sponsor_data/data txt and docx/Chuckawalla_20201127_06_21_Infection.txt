This story was told by a person incarcerated at Chuckawalla.</br></br>

Caller: Because it seems like you can, it's all a crapshoot because you can - I've seen fit people, super fit individuals, which was what I thought. I'm pretty much a fit person. I thought, you know, I can handle it, or beat it off, or whatever. But I've seen guys fitter than me just get reduced to nothing. Lose like 30 pounds. Have constant headaches. Constant cough. And even now after we've been clear for over a month now, they have some type of residual effect from it.</br></br>Everybody's coughing. Everybody has this persistent cough. Everybody has headaches. Everybody feels kind of, you know, they have less energy than they did beforehand. We've seen this thing on 60 Minutes where they're talking about what they call the COVID hangover where these doctors over at Cedars-Sinai are treating people because these individuals, like marathon runners or people who own sports facilities, can no longer run or hold classes because they're, they have fatigue.</br></br>You know, they have no energy to do anything. Or they're in pain. Well, I don't know. It's just kind of like, you know, kind of rung true for a lot of things that are happening here. But I appreciate you listening and hopefully some good will come from this. I thank you very much. Good night.
