I’m currently at KVSP and during the pandemic I got COVID-19 twice. I got the virus twice because how the prison handled the prison outbreak. At KVSP there were 300-plus inmates who caught the virus and KVSP where moving inmates around building to building spreading the virus throughout the prison.</br></br> 

Instead of slamming every building they moved inmates to other buildings that had COVID-19. KVSP put the prison on modified program, with no contact visits, limited phone calls.</br></br> 

The positive side to it was KVSP inmates received the vaccine. Most of the inmates received both vaccines shots. But it's still a struggle being in prison during the pandemic. There's problem with canteen and some of the package catalogs are out of stock on items. 

We also get less yard time with no sport activities, no basketball or any sports activities, there's also no groups or education programs that are not consists. There’s also delay on outside medical treatment. The pandemic has changed a lot of prison policy.</br></br> 

Thank you for taking the time out of your day to understand how the prison system is during COVID.
