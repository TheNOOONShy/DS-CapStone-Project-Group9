This story was told by a person incarcerated at Mule Creek.</br></br>

Caller:	Well, I was tested on December 2nd, and then the following evening, December 3rd, I was called down to the podium and was retested. And 12 days later I was then isolated into a gym, where there was I believe about 90 people, 90 other inmates, there for a 14-day isolation period.</br></br>

So, I should have technically been in the gym for two days. I spent eight days in the gym. In my opinion, the gym was very unsanitary, very cold, very closely compacted. Everybody was pretty close together. The cleaning was very, very poor. The food was very cold. Masks were not mandated.</br></br>

They were from time to time, you know, handed out. But, you know, from everything we're hearing on the TV, it just didn't seem to be that serious of a situation. The toilets were all outdoors. They had one indoor toilet, but it wouldn't, you know, service 90 or 100 people. So, they had several of them outside. Our showers were, was, an outside unit where I personally had to take a cold shower because the water wouldn't keep up with the amount of people using the unit.</br></br>

I can't swear to it, but I've been informed that there's been actually two staff members and two inmates that have died at this prison from the virus. But my biggest issue was the fact of - let me back up a minute. Back to this past summer, we had an inmate in where I was housed who had some illness.</br></br>

They took him out very rapidly. They brought him back in a wheelchair completely covered in a sheet, and the staff member was in full PPE. They were, it appeared that they were assuming that he had the virus. Well, they emptied out his entire cell, put his cellies into a side room overnight, and left him in his cell by himself. And this is before this had become a real big outbreak, and they acted very quickly, very urgently with it.</br></br>

Come to be the next day or two days later, everybody's back in the cell. It wasn't the virus. Well, now that it has hit the amount that it has, the severity that it has, they're very laissez - what's the word, lackadaisical?</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>

Caller: I'm not pronouncing that right, I know. But like I said, I was tested, and it was 12 days after I had been tested that they told me that I was positive and that I needed to go into isolation.</br></br>

And that's been across the board, many people being left in their living quarters with everybody else after they have been tested for several days and then finally isolated.</br></br>

I don't know if I mentioned that the food that we are being served was very cold. And matter of fact, they were doing vitals for everybody checking your O2 saturation, your temperature, and your blood pressure.</br></br>

And they would make the - make us wait for our chow until they were done doing that with everybody in the cell, and that could take a couple three hours at times.</br></br>

UCI: No, I was going to say were they extending dinnertime then to accommodate for you guys having to get tested prior to going?</br></br>

Caller: I don't follow your question. Ask me one more time.</br></br>

UCI: You said that you all had to get tested right before you would go down to eat. Is that correct?</br></br>

Caller: Well, it was, like I said, just the vitals. It wasn't the COVID test.</br></br>

UCI: Oh, vitals. Okay, okay.</br></br>

Caller: Okay, just the vitals. And it didn't happen every time, but it happened a few times within the eight days that I was there. When they would be doing the vitals, chow would show up, but they would put chow on hold until they were done doing all of the vitals. And chow comes first before the vitals because it's only going to hold temperature for so long, and most of the time anyways it was cold already, so.</br></br>

Oh, another thing, the laundry. Only one time in the eight days that I was there did they actually bring in some sheets and blankets to replace our linens. But there were 91 people in there, and they only brought enough for 38 people. There's no way for us to really wash our own laundry. The facilities just were not set up to do what we need to do to be clean.</br></br>

Oh, and showers were every three days, every 72 hours, as if we had been on a disciplinary lockdown. You know, during this virus, hygiene is paramount. They're always talking about and pushing, "Wash your hands. Wash your hands." But yet they don't let us shower but every 72 hours, and that's ongoing. Matter of fact, there even was a sergeant and lieutenant spoken to about it, and they said, "Well, that's what the PSR says to do," which is the program status report.</br></br>

And that is what delineates what is to be allowed and what isn't. So, do you have any other questions? 'Cause I think I've kinda covered what I wanted to say.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, no, this has been great. You mentioned very early on that all of your - most of the bathrooms were outside. Can you explain why that is?</br></br>

Caller: Well, because there's only one toilet in the gym, and that is not enough for 90 to 100 people.</br></br>

And so they've got outhouses, the porta potties, outside. I didn't count them, but I'm going to say there's maybe a dozen of them out there. But they lock the gym door at 9:00, so we don't even get to use the toilet. Well, we have to use it when we have to use it. But, you know, they lock the gym door at 9:00, so we no longer have access to those porta potties.</br></br>

UCI: Okay, so you're then required to just wait until the morning basically if you have to go to the restroom or use the one that services, what did you say, upwards of 90 people or so?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, I believe the capacity of bunks that they put in the gym was 100.</br></br>

UCI: A 100.</br></br>

Caller: And when I was there, I believe the most that was there was, like, 91.</br></br>

UCI: So, do you think that a huge reason why maybe some of your case numbers have gone up recently is because they're waiting such a long time to tell people they've tested positive, and then they're mixing among other people and not quarantining or taking the steps? Yeah?</br></br>

Caller: Yes. And they are just mass moving everybody and shuffling everybody from - there's a couple of yards that the guys - matter of fact, I've heard of guys that went down to the lower gyms on the level three and the level four yards from the level twos, and they're just being shuffled.</br></br>

I heard stories from a couple other guys I know. You know, I'm not speaking on their behalf, but they told me that they were moved six times in four days from a particular building into other gyms and just constantly being shuffled around. It's almost like they're trying to spread it even more so than what it would -</br></br>

Had they just simply locked everybody down into their housing units and left everybody where they were and just monitored those that had severe symptoms and then took them into isolation and treated them, it would not have spread to the extent that it has spread.</br></br>

UCI: Right, yeah. And in your experience, too, you were moved and just left there, right, just waiting for your testing and probably around other people who have also tested positive and who were just, you know, hanging out.</br></br>

Caller: Yes. And -</br></br>

UCI: Oh, go ahead.</br></br>

Caller: Well, I was just going to say thankfully I had no serious symptoms from it, very, very mild. I've had the flu way worse than what I've had, you know, from this. But I have seen many guys in there that were just, you know, really suffering, and they were just left in there. Matter of fact, before I even went to the gym, there was a guy in my housing unit who was very sick, and he even told them that he was, and they didn't - they just left him there.</br></br>

They didn't take him because his test results hadn't come back is all I can assume, because once your test results came back from your COVID, that's when they isolated you in the gym or in another housing unit that they had designated for isolation.</br></br>

UCI: And when you guys are - you know, let's say you test positive. Are you given any medical attention at all if you need it?</br></br>

Caller: Well, they monitor your symptoms.</br></br>

I know a bunch of people who were given cough drops, vitamins, which me personally I never received. Thankfully, I didn't need them. But, yeah, if they get serious enough, their O2 saturation drops down to a certain level, they have taken guys out to the hospital. And I know there was a few that left the gym while I was there, and we got word back that one of them had died. I don't know who. But, yeah.</br></br>

UCI: Well that's, I mean, that's so, I mean, that's hard. Have you been able to cope with any of this? Have you expressed any of this? I mean, how much do you tell your loved ones?</br></br>

Caller: Well, yeah, we have the phone calls and all. But even just speaking with you right now, my emotions are kind of raw because it's like, you don't really have an outlet in here, you know, it's not something that you express in an emotional way, you know.</br></br>

You talk about it with everybody, and everybody's complaining about it. Everybody's aware of what's going on in here. But to actually have any kind of healing or closure from it, it's, you know, it's not easy in here. It's very hard. But, after doing - you kind of become - you kind of get used to, you know, how to deal with things and just, you know, kinda shrug it off.</br></br>

But it doesn't mean it's easy. But you just learn to let it go over time.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, I mean, are you guys given - you know, this may be kind of a redundant question, but are you given any outside time to get, you know, some fresh air, just breathe for a minute?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, they are giving us a limited yard schedule. It's not a daily thing. Like, this week, we have tomorrow morning for and then, two hours and then Wednesday afternoon for two hours, and that's it for the week.</br></br>

But, you know, when I was in the gym, nothing for eight days. They did say they had two hours in the evening assigned for Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, but one night there was too much fog. The next night there was a lot of movement going on, you know, people coming and going out of the gym. They were, you know, moving people around, so they didn't open the yard. You know, so, for eight days we were stuck inside, you know, doing nothing but sitting on our bunk and, you know, just passing time.</br></br>

UCI: So, very, you know, sporadic if you do get it.</br></br>

Caller: Very, at this point in time.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, well, thank you so much for calling. If you could leave anybody with just an idea of what's going on inside, what would be kind of, your main thing you'd want, you know, the public to know?</br></br>

Caller: Well, funny you say because I just heard Governor Newsom talk today about the things that they're doing and being very proactive in the CDCR system, and what he was putting out there is not what's happening in here, far from it. It's very, very poorly managed.</br></br>

We're being told medical is calling the shots in here, but they don't know what they're doing. They are not taking into consideration the human lives that they're impacting and the emotional and psychological effect that it's having on everybody.
