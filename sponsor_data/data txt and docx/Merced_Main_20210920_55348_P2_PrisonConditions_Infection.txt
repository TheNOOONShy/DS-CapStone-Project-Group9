This story was told by a person incarcerated at Merced County Jail.</br></br>  

Caller: And I was a worker, too. They had me work, I've been like exposed to COVID.</br></br>

You know, they have red tags on their doors and they're using the showers, using the phone. And they're not even doing the right procedure as far as cleaning it. Like, you know?</br></br>

Like, I'm over here, like, as a worker, I'm like, I might end up using that phone. Or I know my cousin, because my cousin was in the same spot where I was at. He might use that phone because he was gonna be one of the ones to use that phone, where I was at.</br></br> 

So, I had to bleach - bleach the phone up and just wipe the door handles and stuff like that. And they have this person that's, like, she's positive on COVID, using, touching all this stuff that we're gonna end up touching, too. And it's like, wow.</br></br>

I'm like, you know, to me, it's like they don't - they don't care. They're gloved up, they got the proper mask on and all this and that. And what about us? Like, you know? Like, so, I pretty much quit that job right there like where I was at.</br></br>

Because they had me as a worker, some lockdown, which was in - and so, I quit and then they brought me to the main jail.
