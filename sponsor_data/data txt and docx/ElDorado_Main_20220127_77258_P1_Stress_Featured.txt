This story was told by a person incarcerated at El Dorado County Jail.</br></br>

UCI: And, so, how have you been coping with the crisis? I know a lot of the times people can use programs kind of as an outlet, but since, like, that's not available, how have you been coping with it?</br></br> 

Cause it is difficult to just not be able to do as much. And, also, it's frustrating to know that nothing is being done about what is happening.</br></br>

Caller: Me, so, I mean, luckily — the only thing that we have going for us is they — they issue us tablets, which have lectures from universities and stuff like that. And, so, we're able to, you know, learn. Or at least we're able to, you know, to do that.</br></br>

And the tablets have radio on them and stuff like that. And, so, me personally, so I'm an artist and-</br></br>

UCI: Mhm.</br></br>

Caller: You know, I draw little cartoons that poke fun at what's going on here.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: Like—</br></br>

UCI: Like the ones you see in newspapers?</br></br>

Caller: Exactly, yeah. Actually, sent you guys one, and it's a cartoon of a — of a — of a jailer with a mask on and he says — this is an actual quote, too. He says, “If we have to wear em — if we have to wear masks, so do you.”</br></br> 

And the guy says, “Did get you vaccinated?” He says, “That's none of your concern, cop.” That was a real quote. So all my car — all my cartoons are poking fun — I poke fun at the staff and I try and do it, like, you know, in the most respectful way possible.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, but just a little bit satirical, yeah.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, well, that's cool that they — that they do give you access to tablets. I — because I've heard people talk about their tablets, but I didn't know if it was, like, everyone got one or if it was some people, but that's cool that they do give you the ability to have that as some sort of outlet, I guess.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah. Yeah. It — it is something. I mean, they have — they have lectures from Yale and all kinds of stuff. And you can acquire points and things like that.
