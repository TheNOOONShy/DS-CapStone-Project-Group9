This story was told by a person incarcerated at Chuckawalla.</br></br>

Caller: You know, all of this going, it's been really hard. You know, here we got no visits, you know, getting in touch with our loved ones is hard as it is. You know, we're grateful with GTL that they're giving us free days throughout the month. But it's put a hardship on them. Every time I call my loved ones, my girlfriend, the first thing they're thinking, oh, are you being moved? Are you being shipped to another yard?</br></br>Did you get it again? So, it doesn't make their mind at ease, it's not at ease for them whatsoever. It's very stressful for them. Not to mention it's very stressful for us as inmates being that we're in our cube, settled, and then say they randomly test us and one of the inmates in my cube tests positive, well next thing you know that cube is up and moving.
