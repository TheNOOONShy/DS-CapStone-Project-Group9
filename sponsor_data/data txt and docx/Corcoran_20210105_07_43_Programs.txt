This story was told by a person incarcerated at Corcoran.</br></br>

UCI: How has it been to have reduced programming?</br></br>

Caller: The programming is not, they've been taking like a lot of our programming. But they recently started handing out programming, but I think we were safer when we didn't have programming cause we were more in our cells and away from everybody that we don't have the right to share cells over here and the right stuff to clean or living by our living quarters.</br></br>

UCI: Right. So, they started up the programming again?</br></br>

Caller: Yes, they started up the programming. So, everybody is coming out together again, just like more of a crowd. But, like, a lot of people, a lot of these guys don't wear their masks. So, I personally just stay at my cell and I just come out to do my phone calls, do my job and go back to my cell.</br></br>

That's why these people are starting to get sick because they don't really care about the mask. But these cops don't really pass out masks like that. They'll give them to you once a week.
