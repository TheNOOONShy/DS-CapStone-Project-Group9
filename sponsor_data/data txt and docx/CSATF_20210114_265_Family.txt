This letter was written by a person incarcerated at SATF (California Substance Abuse Treatment Facility and State Prison).</br></br>

This means that the more time they give us, the more good money they receive. Well I want to tell you that I don't have a family in California, everyone is in Mexico. It is very sad since every day or every year on holidays you have no one to celebrate Christmas or your birthday with.</br></br>

Just waiting for a hug but it never comes. But the worst thing is when you receive the news that your father dies but it takes five or six months for you to receive that letter with the bad news. And you cannot do anything, you are powerless in the face of that circumstance.</br></br> 

It is something so sad that it makes you think that you do not wish this on anyone.</br></br>

All you can do is just ask God for forgiveness. And it is so dark that all the nice thoughts that you spent with him come to you. But thank God you get over all with that with time. With the help of God and the programs that we have here.</br></br> 

But that is not the worst since I arrived in the prison, their program is very bad.</br></br>

For example, in the prison where I was we had yard all day and I am at a level two that supposedly we must have more programs however it is not so.
