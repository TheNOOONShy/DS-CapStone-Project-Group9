Dear PrisonPandemic,</br></br>

Thanks for the letter. I'm in a lockdown because of COVID-19. No rehabilitation programming going which we need to get out earlier. Working on myself though enrolled in college Humanities 001: Introduction to Western Culture. Prop 57 was a denial to get out earlier on the base term of my sentence law which was enacted with the purpose to let out non-violent criminals, but they still held the past on you at the Board of Prison terms.</br></br>

Our system is corrupt but the whole world is. I'm originally from Orange County and the state of Florida. The state only care about conviction rates don't matter if you're guilty or not and public defenders are the worst. Which should force everyone to learn the law, it's a joke.</br></br>

Our system is that bad I was exposed to COVID-19 then cleared. I hope you and yours are OK through these times. I have a release date of December 2023. Hopefully I will make it home sooner because I'm in transitions preparing for release and I will get weeks off for that and the college class.</br></br>

Food is horrible here; below the calories a man should be allotted. We are treated like cattle numbers.</br></br>

That's all. If you have any questions please write.
