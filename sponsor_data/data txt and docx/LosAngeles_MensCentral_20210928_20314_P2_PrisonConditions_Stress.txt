This story was told by a person incarcerated at Los Angeles County Men’s Central Jail.</br></br>

UCI: What has the - what else would have made the situation better at your facility?</br></br>

Caller: Just - just sanitation and – I mean the walls, outside – for instance, the walls outside our cells – there's 26 cells on a tier. There are four tiers on each module. And the walls outside our cells – they literally haven't been washed since I've been here. There's - there's every morning, we can get up and run your finger across the bars.</br></br> 

And you can literally see the trail of dust because that - that settled overnight. Simply because the blowers up there, they have dust packed on it, like - like a sandbox. You can literally see the dust falling in there.</br></br>

The ventilation system here has been cut off for the last two weeks – well, I'm gonna say a week – a little over a week, now – where it's just blowing – like, behind us, is what they call a "pipe chase," where the plumbers be at. And they have rats, roaches, and spiders, and lots of different type of insects back there. And it's usually whether – it sucks the air from out the cells into the back.</br></br>

But, somehow, it's been reversed. And, now, it's blowing all the dust and fungus and mold and everything that's back there – it's blowing it into our cells. And we literally had to block off the vent.</br></br>

So, now, we don't have any actual air that helps to circulate into these cells.</br></br>

UCI: Okay. I understand. And that has been getting worse through the pandemic? In that like the way that they've been cleaning the facility has already been like that before the pandemic and just gotten worse is what I'm assuming?</br></br>

Caller: Well, it's - it's basically the same. I can say that they didn't make any changes for the better, in light of the COVID pandemic. There's - there's literally – I mean they – they - like I said, they make a gesture.</br></br>

For instance, we had to fight to get them to pass out a mask for people that wasn't able to get masks through other means. And, since the - since the entire pandemic, where I'm at right now, they've only passed out a mask twice – twice.</br></br>

UCI: And-</br></br>

Caller: Other than that, we literally have to buy our masks through black market type settings. I mean there's – it's just kind of - it's kind of sad. You know.</br></br>

UCI: And so are you using the same mask that you've had since the second time they passed them out or have you had to resort to getting them elsewhere?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah. I had to resort to getting them elsewhere. Because, even though they did pass out the masks, they - they didn't fit. Like, for instance, you can only put one loop on one ear. But, then, you had to tie a string onto the other part just to make it fit around the other part of the ear.</br></br>

And that's everybody. Or, it was - or if your face was small enough, it'd fit so snug on your face it'd feel like you're being gagged.</br></br>

UCI: So it seems like they're providing you guys masks that are ineffective and too small?</br></br>

Caller: Yes. Extremely ineffective.
