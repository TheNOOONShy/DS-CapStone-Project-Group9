To UCI Student,</br></br>

I am a life prisoner, I've been incarcerated for approximately 26 years. A fellow prisoner showed me your notification and I was surprised that anyone cared about what is taking place within the prisons rather it's for historical or immediate solutions. I would like to say that everyone has a story as well as their own interpretation, view or perspective, not everyone has the courage to step up and be heard due to lack of self-confidence.</br></br> 

I'll look at it as if it's important to you it's important to me and all we have to do is listen.</br></br>

I don't know if you’ve ever heard this - it's from a book called “The Man Who Listens to Horses” (1997). It says that “if you act like you only have 15 minutes to hear a person's story, it will take you a lifetime to get the big picture, but if you act like you have a lifetime to get a person’s story you will get everything you need in 15 minutes.” I say that to say this - thank you for taking time to hear people's stories about the prison system and its continual failures and this might take more than 15 minutes.</br></br> 

My experience will start off by answering the provided questions, what has it been like to be inside during this time?</br></br>

When this COVID-19 started becoming more prevalent in society we seen the warnings on TV only. As life moved on, the recommendations to stay at home started being mentioned around February and I was taking a college course at that time that started in January and in March was my midterm. We were walking around like nothing was going on with just called “normal program”, no face covering yet, no recommendations of six feet apart, washing and disinfecting.</br></br> 

As of that time, the prison system was completely unaware of what was about to happen because it was all new.</br></br>

Again we were living life as usual meanwhile society was coming to us all day/everyday by so many means. All shifts first watch, second watch and third watch, this includes prison guards, cooks, nurses, maintenance workers, administrational clerks, counselors, and free staff workers such as laundry and Furniture Factory free stuff workers, men and women. When facial coverings started being recommended the prison made a choice to make their own for people in society and for prisoners.</br></br> 

We still hadn't received any yet because somebody wanted to appear helpful by providing face masks for society. After enough were accumulated they were then issued to inmates by three per inmate, it was a soft cloth that was not an official N95, inmate manufactured.</br></br>

At this time the program starts to change, only one building on the yard at a time from 9 am to 12:45 and after everyone returns to their housing unit and locks up. A different building would be let out to the yard from 1 pm to 4:15 pm, we were still allowed to have close contact with each other as well as canteen personal, inmate telephones are on the yard. And there's a total of 24 phones available, 12 in one corner of the recreational yard and 12 on the other side of the recreational yard and those 12 are split by six on one side and six on the other side, divided by prison politics meaning Blacks on one side and any other race on the other side.</br></br>

For a long time during the COVID program all phones were being used, around May the prison implemented the plan of six feet apart only every other phone may be used to create space between prisoners. No outbreak yet so guys were still exercising on the pull up bars, dip bars, jogging without a mask was allowed at this time, the canteen process however did change. The prison guard would bag up your items and put it on a small cart and push it away from the canteen area, let you sign for it and you take your items away big or small.</br></br>

Around August the director of the CDCR at that time had allowed inmate transfers prior to and during the pandemic and by spreading the disease this risk-taking movement impacted so many lives across the board and finally he was replaced. The choices he's made has caused so much pain to prisoners and families. He was mixing protective custody inmates with general population inmates and they were violently attacking each other and he'd say “it was their choice to get along.”</br></br> 

But his decision-making process was detrimental, reckless and deadly and that's why he was replaced by a woman who's proven to be more fit for that job. This is still part of the first question!</br></br>

As San Quentin exploded, during their crisis a judge ordered them to reduce that population to at least half, however that judge did not specify how to do so. Therefore San Quentin moved as many as possible to other prisons, no COVID tests or temperature checks just transfer. And if men refused they were threatened and given a rules-violation. Instead of considering their safety they gave them a definite death sentence. As those men arrived to Soledad prison the impact of the virus started little by little finding its way into housing units by medical staff who pass out medication and by prison guards.</br></br> 

Inmates were still going to work in the Furniture Factory which should have been shut down but CDCR has proven “profit over prisoner” is their motto by allowing transfers and unessential workers to go to and from in large groups with no control of the crowd.</br></br>

These unessential workers became a big part of infecting others by lack of management and believing they were more important than other inmates by giving them more privileges and less oversight. Some buildings have 50 to 70 inmate workers and one particular building has at least 150 to 200 inmate workers in it. I used to work and live among all these that's how I know.</br></br> 

So COVID testing was getting men moved around who tested positive, they were being placed in a special housing unit for isolation until the virus exploded here in Soledad CTF Central, and those inmate workers became the primary concern and all newly infected inmates were being relocated to the housing unit.</br></br>

Uninfected men were being moved out to make room for the infected. The mixing and mashing of men created more positive infections which were a deadly result once again. The warden had stated in a video address to the inmate population that “once we lose control of the virus we’ll place tents on the yard.” Those were erected about two weeks ago and now no one is allowed around those.</br></br> 

While on the yard, officers and inmates are passing away. There is a big shortage of staff and now we're not receiving canteen or quarterly packages which are sitting in a warehouse spoiling.</br></br>

Due to the shortage of staff, we might get a shower once a week, we get cell fed at around 10 am instead of 7 am like we used to. Protesters were recently outside Soledad and the prison officials gave a statement saying they were following CDC guidelines and I beg to differ. We haven't had a COVID test or temperature checks for at least two weeks and we've been to the yard twice, once on December 22nd and recently December 26th, still no testing or temperature checks, so the lack of concern and regard is once again deadly.</br></br>

There was a saying that used to say “we're in this together” but I'm trying to see who that was for? This prison’s dysfunctions need to be addressed and held accountable. As a lifer we are asked to be transparent at the parole board, why does CDCR get to manipulate the system and get away with it. Prison officials should be modeling a more honest and trustworthy system, what would happen if prisoners follow their example?</br></br> 

This is taxpayers money at work and society should be able to see how it is being used. This is not an opinion.</br></br>

While in November all units were placed on quarantine status so officers and inmates who handle food wear disposable gowns and plastic see through face shields and the blue N95 nose and mouth covering and rubber gloves, although there is no hand sanitizer in house or on yard available, inmates are encouraged to wash their hands.</br></br> 

Inmates used to be allowed to clean and disinfect the housing unit but due to staff shortage all inmates are locked up after the feeding process is over. They're allowed to shower but once they're done there is no movement. This is some of what it's been like inside during this time.</br></br>

How do I feel about my safety inside? I am only in control of myself, my own thoughts and actions, my responses don't go too far. Administration refuses to hear out prisoners and their ideas for what we consider improvements of their shortcomings. Soledad prison is full of life or such as myself who have been incarcerated for 26 years and counting, the majority of us have extreme insight on what prisons are capable of doing and not doing.</br></br> 

Prison officials take their orders from people who have not been in the trenches with us yet decide what will work and what will not work. This method of “long-distance supervision” shows they are too busy to come and hear and see for themselves.</br></br>

An example, everyone is gone for the holidays but the problem still exists. As they drag their feet we're still denied canteen and quarterly packages and the prisons feed us and amount fit for a five year old. Health is critical for everyone including prisoners who cannot simply go buy fresh fruit or vegetables when they like to. So this has a lot to do with health and safety in which prisoners that are being treated as less than should at least be fed enough or allowed to purchase their own food for those who can afford to do so.</br></br> 

The prison could have given all prisoners non-alcohol hand sanitizer for their own personal usage and never did so, but the prison employees had their own. If it's not done in the time of a crisis, then what is their purposeful behaviors on a deeper thought?</br></br>

As they turn their backs and walk away and go home day after day we're still hoping for a better day. We're stuck in a cell 24 hours a day, we might get a shower once a week or yard time for a hour every 21-days apart according to the Mitchel Law. So the way I feel about my safety is a mixed bag of emotions seeing the failures of CDCR. I don't let it consume my mind because I'm in control of my thoughts and I know how to keep myself safe.</br></br> 

Some prisoners might not be able to do so such as elders, those who have mental health issues, people who are still in addiction and making their own alcohol to escape their anxiety or fears.</br></br>

No one from the mental health even comes to ask their patients how they're doing. Those type of prisoners might not even realize the severity or impact of what's taking place due to the medication they're being given, these prisoners might not be able to articulate their stories yet still need a voice. How I feel about my safety is a pretty wide view because it's unraveled from the top to the bottom and that's where prisoners are at.</br></br>

What has it been like to have reduced visitation from family and loved ones? Well first of all some prisoners don't have anyone at all so we as prisoners ask others to go check on who they can to see if they're okay or need anything. And if that need could be met the men inside their own housing unit do their best to help each other. As for us that do have someone, this has had so many different effects.</br></br> 

For myself, I've become somewhat immune to the separation from lengthy lockdowns due to riots and violence. There's times that emotional constriction takes place and because of where I live I've learned to turn it off and on as needed which no one should be doing because this affects our decision making process.</br></br>

By purposely blocking things out, I know my family misses me and I miss them too. I just have to accept the things I cannot change and stay courageous in what I can, again I'm only in control of myself. I bring it back to basics and write letters expressing unconditional love rather they write back or not, they're doing exactly what they need to be doing and that is simply living their lives.</br></br> 

When I do get a letter it turns out my patience paid off and I move forward, not that I was on hold, I'm living day by day also.</br></br>

Recently the prison implemented video visits for all prisoners yet it's failed to include all prisoners. The prison rewrote the rules and are only allowing prisoners who have tested positive to partake in this exclusive event. My video visits keeps getting cancelled as well as many others within my housing unit. Again our ideas are not important but they could bring the laptop to my building.</br></br> 

As I continue to observe the failures and lack of communication it looks like the elephant might be pregnant and they still look the other way.I’d love to see my family but the prison decides that for me.</br></br>

How have I been coping with the crisis? I've been practicing self discipline, self control, staying aware of my feelings and thoughts, being aware of all triggers, the five senses, touch, taste, smell, sight, sound and my internal feelings and moods and expectations and perceptions. I look at all these things like writing on a chalkboard and keep or remove what I want, I make a choice to be happy and gratefulness takes place. I continue to use stabilization by reading my Bible, praying, reading positive books only, exercising daily, listing things to do and meeting those needs that are within my reach.</br></br> 

Changing the TV channel when things seem bad to myself, put my radio on (KLOV) and stay inspired and motivated remembering my goals and values and keeping my life in alignment.</br></br>

Through this process and staying aware of any red flag warnings such as bad past experience or and lapses such as mental, physical, spiritual and emotional. Having awareness and understanding helps myself stay focused and connected to the current issues. As well as being mindful of future events that could take place and having an ability to cope and manage these times that could become stressful to some. I continue to reach out to the men within my own housing unit to encourage those who might need a little boost from time to time.</br></br> 

This is how I've been coping throughout this crisis and I hope this small assessment can be helpful to your purpose and program, my story is still being written.</br></br>

Sincerely,</br></br>

May God bless you and everyone around you.
