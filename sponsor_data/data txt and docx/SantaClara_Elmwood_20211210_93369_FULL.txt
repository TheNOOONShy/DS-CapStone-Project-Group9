This story was told by a person incarcerated at Santa Clara Main Jail.</br></br>

Caller: During this pandemic, we’ve been dropping like flies. Our whole – our whole facility is - is exceeding over with COVID pandemic inmates that are infected. It’s a huge outbreak up here.</br></br>

They don’t powerwash the rooms, the cells, after they– it’s like one inmate after inmate coming through the cells. Sometimes women, you know, they come in there off their addictions. Feces on the floor, blood on the wall.</br></br>

Like they just shove us in these cells. Like we’ve been waiting for the booster shot and it’s been a whole month. They keep telling us that we gon’ get a booster shot– we ain’t got our booster shot.</br></br>

They not washing down the chains that they– after they come in contact with after inmate after inmate. I mean, then they handcuff us so tight that we get skin tears and we needing almost stitches. And one time they choked me with a chain to try to subdue me and round my neck.</br></br>

And then you know what? Then they let these people call us Black people ni****s all day, taking extra program time. Then you know what else they do?</br></br>

They pass kites– and then we was here when that one officer was selling everybody drugs. Officer [redacted]. Man, Elmwood DOC is the dirtiest place in the whole entire world. Even our paddy wagons to transfer to court.</br></br>

They got this caked up with just debris, it was just blood, all that shit. I was like “Damn, why don’t y’all even powerwash.” They call it biohazards, the rule, they call it power washing the rooms out. They don’t even do that shit, man.</br></br>

It’s just– that’s why we droppin’ like flies. We over here dying like the prison compounds was dying up in San Quentin. And you know what? You know, some people don’t even wanna come in and get the booster shot or the main COVID test.</br></br>

They gotta ask you whether or not to take the test. And you know, America right now, they telling people that just to have a job they gotta be mandated– you know, COVID-19 vaccine. You know, you go people in here spitting on the– today we got our door spit on.</br></br>

And we else would’ve pressed charges; we can’t even press charges. They didn’t give us no cleaning supply. And this one inmate– this one inmate– she ain’t even gotten tested for her COVID yet. I’m telling you, you know, in the [redacted], it’s like one of the best places to be at.</br></br>

Right? Because its quarantine, it’s one cell room door. So, Elmwood doesn’t have very many housing cells– housing dorms that have single cells.</br></br>

So, in some of the single cells they have in [unintelligible] mental health dorms, some of those people come straight off the streets. They– [unintelligible] some of the epidemic for methamphetamine. Okay? We got hit with a epidemic.</br></br>

And so some people were living in the creeks, I’m pretty sure you guys have seen it on the news. That we been in the newspaper regarding having to get a lot of housing for homeless people during our epidemic. And they put a– the government putting a whole like million dollars trying to rectify this stuff.</br></br>

But a lot of the people that are homeless, we are so tied into the system that we still coming in and out of jail. So they– so they stopped– the court systems stopped allowing people to get out of jails for free, and now Elmwood is back onto the top out of all the prisons in the whole system.</br></br>

We the only one. And we’re; we don’t even get– we ain’t even get, man– the booster shot been out for two months now. And now we got the Omicron. Now we looking at these people– man, we look at this place having needles all over the place. Then we havin’ blood stains on the windows, on the doors.</br></br>

Some people come in, and they beat their doors up. You know, the officers don’t be wearing gloves, and then when we do have an outbreak; when we do have an outbreak in the pods they don’t put up notice for everybody to try to– to try to, try to– let us know to start you know, taking precautions.</br></br>

So, some of us; thank God they upgraded the cleaning spray. You know, to where it seems like it’s effective. One of the inmates, they did some construction work right? And they tore up the bathrooms, put in new towel, they power washed the floors during COVID.</br></br>

I was like, “Damn man, they doing us hella dirty.” I’ve been doing time in [unintelligible], California, and Elmwood DOC for 16 years, year round, and only have five months out of those 16 years of free. And that five months was sporadic.</br></br>

So, I pretty much did a life sentence back here. And I tell you man, our white card, we gotta see the nurse. At one point, they even made us pay three dollars for a white card. They stopped that, thank God, before COVID.</br></br>

And so now, the white card; we don’t even get triaged by the nurse. And they starting to hire new nurses. Man you got nurses that’ll give you 18 pills of someone else’s pills. And then you try to tell officers that this ain’t my medication. And next thing you know, they trynna lock us down and pepper spray us.</br></br>

Look, let me tell you something man. They got these new nurses, they don’t even know how to refill– do your refills. They don’t even know how to input your information inside the systems. Then they try to turn around and say “oh we don’t wanna give you meds because your pod is too loud.”</br></br>

Or they talking about someone else– the new people don’t even wanna pass out medication. And you know what? They even had a– the nurses don’t wanna wear no gloves. They told, they told the nurses that they didn’t want them wearing gloves during on the pandemic.</br></br>

Man. I said wow. You know, only people that wear gloves in here are the police, and I’m surprised they still touching them chains, man. And you know, I don’t wanna go to court. You know, I refused my last court day.</br></br>

I was like, you know, the paddy wagon dirty. You know, I mean they put a lot of– they gave us a tablet– to [unintelligible] we can reach out. Man, I just know that the tablets they gave us– thank God– you know, that we were able to extend our room somewhat have to share the same phone.</br></br>

You know, I mean– I mean, some things gotta change. I was like damn, we ain’t even spraying down the tables every– you know, we ain’t even spraying down the tables. You know, like at least every two, three hours. So some, you know, of these dorm cells got 30, got 64 inmates in one room. Then we got the dorms that's open right, so.</br></br>

They still allowing people to shack up in the cells together, with cellmates. And man, I’m [unintelligible] person who came off the streets, and they don't have no enough people– man, we’ve been eating baloney sandwiches for breakfast. Man, we– hello?</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, I’m still here.</br></br>

Caller: Okay good. Man we’ve been eating baloney sandwiches since before COVID, we don’t get no hot breakfast. That part. Then, we’ve been having to– you know what? The commissary, man I don’t even wanna talk about the commissary.</br></br>

We can’t even order– the commissary people out here don’t– only let us order 45 to 50 dollars a month, or a week on the commissary. Then, I’m telling you man, [unintelligible] we got a whole bunch of people– thank God you answered the phone. You know, I have minutes.</br></br>

I apologize for hanging up yesterday, I tried to talk to you yesterday, but we went on lockdown. You know?</br></br>

UCI: Mhm.</br></br>

Caller: And you know, man– you know, the Black people that work– we barely got Black; we barely got four Black officers throughout the whole compound.</br></br>

UCI: Oh.</br></br>

Caller: Okay, so there’s– you know– there’s a huge segregation, segregational situation. It’s a huge like a– it’s a bad elephant in the room when it comes to an inmate talking to an officer when they’re African American.</br></br>

Okay, you know like I’ve never in my life– I’ve heard ni****s all day long. All for the last full days, and these officers, man. Like today, the same lady that saw people smoking in the rooms, they ain’t, they ain’t– man they smoking in the rooms. You know, then the sheriff officer passing out methamphetamine.</br></br>

Man, we’ve been on the news in the last three months– we’ve been on the news almost every week, man. The officer that was selling crick and crack up in here– you know she did to me, man? I ain’t– man, you know what? This lady was like 6’5, maybe like four, 350.</br></br>

You know this Hispanic lady, man. I can’t believe it man. I just got jumped by a whole bunch of ‘em, man. You know, and they put three– they put three– shackles on my hand, and three shackles on my feet, man. And choked me with a chain and left me in a black chair, man. They didn’t even put me in the chair right.</br></br>

I was just like why y’all doing this? And then the staff will say SJPD– man they brought a baton on me, shot me in the back with an electric gun. People in San Jose are hella prejudious in the street.</br></br>

Man, I wish Black Lives Matter would come down here and talk to us. And I just hope by me leaving this, leaving this voicemail for you– that some of these– that’ll you’ll write me a letter to California [unintelligible].</br></br>

I need the address for [unintelligible], I need some people from Black Lives Matter. And main thing, can you send me the telephone address to Governor Gavin Newsom’s– I just want to say behalf on of three black people that are in the [redacted], man we so grateful that you found us.</br></br>

You have a nice day. God Bless.</br></br>

Caller: Thank you, you as well. Happy holidays.
