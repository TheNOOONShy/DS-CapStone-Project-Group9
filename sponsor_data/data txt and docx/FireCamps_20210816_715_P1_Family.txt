This story was told by a person incarcerated at Fire Camps.</br></br>

Caller: And my complaint was, look, if you can allow us to go and pick up our food trays, why - and you can allow us to take showers every other day, why can't we go over and use the phone? And simply wipe the phone down so we can reach out to our loved ones and let them know where we are.</br></br>

My mother was calling the facility Jamestown Sierra Conservation Center every day for three weeks, because she thought I had died because I didn't call her for her birthday. And they refused to let her know what my status was because she was not on an authorized person on my list.</br></br>

When they did finally reach out to me, I had already been moved from that facility to this new facility, which is pretty cool, in Soledad. So, it took them over three weeks to notify me that my mother was frantically looking for me.
