UCI: How was COVID-19 handled by your facility at the beginning of the outbreak?</br></br>Caller: Very poorly. Like I said, it - it went from yard - there's six yards here. It went from yard to yard to yard to yard, and I think our yard was the hit hardest and - and first.</br></br>I know a guy here that, you know, that was a kitchen worker that he was a lifer himself and he couldn't risk getting a write-up, and he had tested negative, but they - he had to still go to work knowing that there was positive people and - and the risk of getting it, the virus, but they - he had to go to work still to not get a write-up because he's trying to go home to his family, and he ended up dying.</br></br>You know, he ended up passing away getting the virus, you know, and now his - his family's, you know, suffering because of it because he was trying to go home to his family and they still made him go to work.</br></br>UCI: Is it being handled differently now?</br></br>Caller: Not really so much differently.</br></br>I feel like they're - they - they're letting PIA work because I feel like it benefits the prison because they make millions of dollars a year off - off PIA here, but they aren't - aren't letting vocations run, so - which is education. They're not letting that run, but I feel - because they're getting paid a - for vocations no matter what. But the PIA, if PIA isn't running, which is the - the business they have running in our yard, then they don't get money.</br></br>They're - you know, they're lost - lost out on all - millions of dollars a year. So I don't know why they would let free staff come in and out and be around our inmates, which inmates can bring it back to the - to the building to 250 people in each building.</br></br>UCI: Mm-hmm. If possible, could you tell us about - could you tell us month-by-month how the situation has changed at your facility?</br></br>Caller: At first it was no yard. We would - we're in our racks in dorms. They give us - they do give us masks and stuff, but, you know, like I said, the cops - the cops got tired of wearing them, the inmates got tired of wearing these masks, you know, because it feels like it's not going to stop it anyways here.</br></br>We're in a building with recycled air. It's not like we have windows open; you know? It's - it's a prison. We're not supposed to have windows open; you know? They're supposed to be secure and safe from people escaping, so it's like a - it's like a sealed box; you know? How is the virus supposed to escape if we're in a sealed box? You know, prison is no place for a pandemic; you know? And I feel that a lot of people are doing good trying to go home, and if they see people programming and been down 25 years and 60 years old, barely, you know, only a couple years left of their life, I feel like they should release them.</br></br>Why would you make them sit in a box and that's pretty much like a death penalty; you know?
