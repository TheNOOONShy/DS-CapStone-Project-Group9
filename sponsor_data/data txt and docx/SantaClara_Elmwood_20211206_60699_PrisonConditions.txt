This story was told by a person incarcerated at Elmwood Correctional Facility.</br></br>

Caller: The other thing I forgot to tell you is we don't even have hot water running in our sink.</br></br>

So, you would think with COVID, you would want to be extra clean and be able to wash your hands properly with warm water. And we don't even have that. We have cold water.</br></br>

And that's it. And then the showers are very dirty. Very, very dirty.</br></br>

They're supposed to be cleaning those I think after each use. We're lucky if the showers are cleaned, you know, every few days maybe. And a ton of people are going in and out of those showers regularly.</br></br>

So, it's scary as far as the COVID goes. And, you know, you can't force the inmates here to get vaccinated. It is their choice. I've been vaccinated, but many have not been.</br></br>

But they are tested. But that test is only as accurate as the day you test, right? So, you just don't know what you're being exposed to here. And we don't have hand sanitizer because they're afraid that people will drink it and get drunk off it or something. And so, we have very little to keep ourselves, you know, free of this.</br></br>

We are given masks. But as soon as you go into your room with seven other women, you're not wearing your mask inside the room. You're wearing - you're wearing your mask just to travel from your room to the shower. Or from the room to the telephone.
