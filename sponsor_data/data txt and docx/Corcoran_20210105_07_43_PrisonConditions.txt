This story was told by a person incarcerated at Corcoran.</br></br>

UCI: Oh, okay. Go ahead.</br></br>

Caller: So, you're asking me about the stuff that's happening right here right with a pandemic and how I am coping with it?</br></br>

UCI: Yes.</br></br>

Caller: Okay, well, the coping it's not as great as one thinks out there it is. There's only so much stuff that we can get. If we say that we're sick, for instance, there's like a timeframe that we have to wait in order to get seen.</br></be>

So, the stress levels get high. And we have inmates that are placed in our cells and there's only so much, there's only so much that we can do.</br></br>

UCI: Can I just ask, which facility are you housed at?</br></br>

Caller: In Corcoran.</br></br>

UCI: Corcoran?</br></br>

Caller: Yes.</br></br>

UCI: Okay. All right. So, like what has the COVID-19 situation been like at your facility? Like is there anything troubling or concerning to you?</br></br>

Caller: Everything it’s totally wrong here. Everybody here pretty much caught the pandemic. We were all quarantined for a long time but there were a lot of people popping up sick.</br></br>

So, everything is troubling and causes mental distress to everyone. So, everyone's walking around here on their toes and everything all stressed out because they're saying that we're gonna be getting used to it, but they're not doing nothing but just giving us masks, like once a week, if that, like new masks.
