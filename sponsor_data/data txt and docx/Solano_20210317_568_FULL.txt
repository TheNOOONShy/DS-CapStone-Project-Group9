This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Solano.</br></br>

Hello PrisonPandemic! Just received your letter on Friday so, as you see. I’m here responding to all your concerns. I’ve got to tell you how good you’re thinking about me, and all of us fighting to stay alive in this broken system and even more, desperate times. By the way I’m open to being known personally, I’m just saying.</br></br>Anyways, I see you’re a college student too. I just graduated with Dean's Honors myself. Your team is what? Sociologists? In CDCR now, having infected all of us here at Solano, are trying to reach hard-status in doing so.</br></br>They moved or transferred inmates from two institutions in particular, doing so and although, claiming these inmates were tested prior to arresting and being placed among us in dorm situations with barely three feet separation from the persons to the right and left sides of you. Reminder, we are double bunk bed already too.</br></br> Once they realized we were being subjected to these new arrivals, they began testing us all. This was in January of 2021. Someone in the archaic medical system, along with custody and warden Matheson came up with a scheme of moving us from buildings to others as isolations cells instead.</br></br>Once there for me, they tested us at 8:45 pm, then at 5 am, told us I’ve tested positive and moved us units into a gym that housed positive inmates already. Now, we never received any form of positive testing, nor do we know the tests ratios for false positives possibilities.</br></br>Remaining in this environment for another 14 days with tests twice a week, then moved to our old areas once again. One Black inmate wrote a appeal on all of this, warden Matheson came to him directly to respond. His concerns were aforementioned to my own, she said, “six-feet distancing, CDCR does not abide by it for those inmates found to be positive because everyone in here is positive!”.</br></br>According to her separation now is fruitless! This is crazy, since a lot of us had been tested since August of 2020 and up until these moves, never were positive, nor had symptoms. Naturally, asymptomatic results vary but myself, I never received official documentation until I was scheduled to leave.</br></br>I’m a risk factor of 10, now and never have been given a first vaccination let alone the follow-up one. Everyone in this building has since today, been given two shots! We’re talking about younger inmates they need to work their PIA industry contracts as well Caltrans on the hill here!</br></br>The only support inmates are workers who also were energized much the aged. They are (CDCR) trying to fully open up by April 1st. Masks are exchanged once every two weeks and only just recently are KN95 masks.</br></br>Anyways, there is a possibility masks being monitored and thrown away unbeknown to us, believe it! It’s been investigated, found true before, and reported to California Inspection General in Sacramento. At least people have reported it happens.</br></br>I will call you collect one of these days but since you took a moment to write me, I feel the need to reply back to you. Thank you for believing in me too, feels good, especially I’ve nobody outside anymore to write. I’ve been locked up 26 years for a misdemeanor petty-theft.</br></br>Long story. God be with you.</br></br>

Sincerely.
