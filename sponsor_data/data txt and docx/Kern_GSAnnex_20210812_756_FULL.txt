This story was told by a person incarcerated at an ICE/Private-Contractor facility.</br></br>

UCI: Tell me about your COVID story.</br></br>

Caller: Okay. So, I was incarcerated before this whole COVID came up. When it reached the facility that I was at, I was on the cleanup crew. And the first person that got the COVID in the facility was one of the staff members that had traveled to Europe and came back with it.</br></br> 

A couple of us were asked to go and clean up and disinfect the area, not knowing that it had been infected with COVID. They just told us that we just had to clean it up and disinfect it.</br></br>

We cleaned it up. And, unfortunately, they never warned us. So, we went in there, and we cleaned it up. After we were done, they quarantined us, and they told us that we had to get quarantined because, technically, we had been exposed to this COVID.</br></br> 

Me and my partner ended up being negative with it, but there was an outbreak that broke out throughout the whole facility. And a couple of months down the road, I ended up catching it regardless.</br></br>

UCI: Damn.</br></br>

Caller: That was one of the first ones in the county to catch it. And while I was quarantined, it was a pretty scary process because there wasn't really any information provided to us and it was all new to us. While I was there, I'd seen another inmate that must have had other physical problems, health problems, because he ended up dying in there.</br></br>

UCI: Damn.</br></br>

Caller: And to us, there were really no answers to all of our questions. So, it's pretty scary. And they weren't giving us no releases or anything. So, we were just sitting there with really not much hopes.</br></br> 

So, I sat there quarantined. And after I got cleared medically from my COVID after I had caught it, I kept getting rehoused in different areas of the jail because of this whole COVID issue.</br></br>

And there were other inmates that would catch in the same facility, and we would get quarantined again. Then we would get rehoused and they would put us with other people that still had it. So, it was just it was pretty scary, honestly.</br></br> 

It was intimidating, knowing that, after we had already caught it, they're still exposing us back and forth with it. And there was nothing we could do about it because it had spread out throughout the whole facility.</br></br>

UCI: That's crazy.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah. Yeah. There were guys that were coming in off of the streets that were testing negative when they brought them in. And they were putting them in units where there was a lot of us that had already had it.</br></br> 

Some of us were still testing positive for it even though they had cleared us. And they were still putting guys in there. Once we made it past that - like I said, once we were already cleared, they were still mixing everybody up.</br></br> 

And that whole thought of catching it again was pretty concerning, because especially, like I said, to me and from my experience, I got to see somebody pass away from it. And it's really intimidating.</br></br> 

UCI: Wow.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah. So, even to this last month, there was still another inmate that caught the COVID. And they were telling us, with this new strand and even though we had our vaccines now and everything, that there was still a possibility that we could still get it.</br></br>

So, it's been an ongoing, over a year now, issue with the COVID. And when I left the prison yard, I still left from a yard that was in quarantine because there was somebody there with COVID and we were exposed.</br></br>

And then they brought me here, and they quarantined me again. But it's still a- it's still a concern. You know, as long as we're in an institution, there's really nothing we could to do prevent ourselves from it. All the staff is the ones that walk in and out of the facility and that could technically bring it in to us. And we could still catch it again, apparently.</br></br>

UCI: And you're just at their mercy.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah.</br></br>

UCI: Right? Like, whatever they do, you just like - right? It doesn't matter. You could be as safe as you want. What do you think?</br></br>

Caller: And then? I'm sorry. I didn't hear that.</br></br>

UCI: Oh, no. I'm saying it doesn't matter what you do. The COs will just get COVID whenever they want and bring it in, right?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah. Yeah. It's up to them, basically, you know? There's no way we could catch it in here. They're the ones that are going out to the streets and being exposed to it.</br></br> 

And they bring it back in here to us. As far as the vaccines go, unfortunately, I was in a facility that only provided us with one specific shot too, which was the Johnson & Johnson.</br></br> 

And, to me, that's still a concern because, from what I've heard in here over the news, that was one of the ones that there were more issues with. So, there's still really nothing to bring us any sort of comfort while we're incarcerated and having to deal with this whole pandemic and on top of that with our legal cases that we have going on.</br></br>

UCI: That's crazy, dude.</br></br>

Caller: Oh, yes. It's been a pretty scary experience for me, honestly, being incarcerated and having to deal with it from in here. And on top of that, obviously, there's the concerns of our families in the streets dealing with it too. And we're limited. We're not able to be out there and provide. Yeah, it's been a tough experience.</br></br>

UCI: I can't imagine what that's like, but that's had to have been tough. Thanks for sharing that with me.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah. So, yes, totally.</br></br>

UCI: Have there been any ways for you to cope, you know, like outlets in the prison, you know?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, it's been. Like I said, there's really not much available to us here. We're so crowded in this place. There's a bunch of people, and there's still the potential of an outbreak. And it's a scary thought, knowing that it could happen at any moment, just like it's going in the streets.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: So, yeah, that's pretty much been my experience with it.</br></br>

UCI: Has the prison been treating COVID seriously since you got there?</br></br>

Caller: We were quarantined. They've taken some initiative. We got tested. They come through and do temperature checks on the daily, but I'm not sure if they're really going to be testing again or not.</br></br>

I haven't been here that long. If they're going to be testing us periodically this year. If there's any people that might have caught it or anything. I don't know if just doing temperature checks is enough to control it or for them to know if it's here or not.</br></br>

We do go outside to the yard and share it with people that are in other buildings. So, if anybody else even in another building has it, I'm pretty sure that, through all the equipment and stuff, it could probably spread out too.</br></br>

UCI: And they don't have the facilities to keep the equipment clean, I'm sure.</br></br>

Caller: I'm not sure if they disinfect them after every building that goes in there and uses it or not, honestly.</br></br>

UCI: Damn.</br></br>

Caller: I, personally, haven't seen it myself. I mean they run different buildings back to back. As soon as our time's up, the next building goes in, you know?</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, what's your impression? What do you think based on what you see the staff do and the COs?</br></br>

Caller: I would probably think that it would be more appropriate if they probably have somebody designated to just disinfecting the area with some disinfectant, whether it be bleach or something else, to hit all the equipment after every building has been done with it.</br></br>

UCI: Anything, yeah.</br></br>

Caller: To prevent it at least from spreading from one building to the next if it were to come into the building. I don't know if it's been here yet or not. Like I said, I haven't been here that long. But that's usually how it happens.</br></br>

Just one person catches it, and then it's a major outbreak. Next thing you know, all the buildings have it. And they really don't. I don't see how they could possibly control it here, because all the buildings are taken up. So, I don't know how they would spread it out to quarantine people or whatever.</br></br>

UCI: Wow.</br></br>

Caller: That's a major concern to me. That's a major concern to, once it gets in here, I don't know how they. There's really no way to quarantine anybody.</br></br>

UCI: Amazing. Incredible. Unbelievable.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah.</br></br>

UCI: Just the basics, huh? Just missing the basics. And I don't know. I don't know what it's like to be in your position, but I feel for you. I can't imagine what that's like, to not have access to those basic resources that you're entitled to.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah it's very- like I said, it's a scary thought. It is very concerning, and there's really not much you could do about it. I mean I wish that they would have more options available to people that qualify where they offer more mails or alternative solutions to where you could probably get released under some sort of supervision and follow up on your cases from the outside where you have more actions to staying healthier and safer, in a sense.</br></br>

UCI: Of course.</br></br>

Caller: It seems like this place is running as normal. There's really not much of that taken into consideration, it doesn't seem like to me at least.</br></br>

UCI: That's incredible, dude.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah.</br></br>

UCI: And how has it been- you said, you were talking a little bit about it's tough dealing with your loved ones on the outside dealing with COVID. And you're on the inside, can't do anything.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, it's very difficult.</br></br>

UCI: And not that you can't do anything, but you know what I mean. Sorry.</br></br>

Caller: Well, the worst part is I came from another institution. And in the other places where I was at, like in the state prison and county jail, over there, they had already opened up to allow our visitors to come in and see us. And to hear they're not allowing us, I don't understand why.</br></br>

UCI: Not allowing visitors? Okay.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah. They're not allowing our visits. And the only way that we could talk to them is, basically, over the phone. They have a system that's available. There's some tablets to facetime, but it's really bad. It cuts out. You can't really see them.</br></br>

UCI: That's not right.</br></br>

Caller: My parents are very. They're older, and they struggle with stuff like that. So, it makes it impossible for me. So, it's a major struggle.</br></br>

UCI: Hey. You know, I'm so happy that, I mean, I feel for you that you struggle with stuff like talking to your parents on those tablets. But you being able to tell the program, that's the point, you know? That's why we're doing this program is, so that you can share your story.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah. Well, no problem, man. As a matter of fact, I came right now. I was in there reading up. I'm glad to have shared my story with you as much as I could. But right now the officer just went by, warning us that they're going to have a count. So.</br></br>

UCI: Perfect.</br></br>

Caller: They want us to get off this phone, I guess.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah. Hey, thank you so much for participating in PrisonPandemic. I'm so happy you were able to share your story, and you should be able to see it up on the website soon enough.</br></br>

Caller: All right. Thank you, guys, for taking your time and your consideration for trying to help people out and hearing us out, at least.</br></br>

UCI: Hey, that's all we need to hear, man. Thank you so much. Have a great day, okay?</br></br>

Caller: All right, man.</br></br>

UCI: All right. See you.</br></br>

Caller: All right. Thank you.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah. Bye.</br></br>

Caller: All right. Have a good one.</br></br>

UCI: You too. Bye.
