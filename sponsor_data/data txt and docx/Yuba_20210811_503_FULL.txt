This story was told by a person incarcerated at an ICE/Private-Contractor facility.</br></br>UCI: So, tell me more about what happened with the rest of the prisoners before.</br></br>
Caller: Well, the other prisoners, the majority of them were released under the Rivas- Zepeda Rivas Act, the lawsuit that they filed for here and, and some were deported, and now it's only - it's come down to - the numbers started going down.</br></br>
UCI: Mhmm. And what has the COVID situation been like for you?</br></br>
Caller:  Well, it's been real hard for me and, you know, for my family especially and for the rest of the prisoners here because, you know, I've seen things going on.</br></br>UCI: Mhmm.</br></br>Caller: Because quite few of the prisoners here contracted the COVID.</br></br>
UCI: Mhmm.</br></br>
Caller: And there was really no precautions here, you know, at the county jail until towards almost the middle of the pandemic when they started using face masks and all that, almost December.</br></br>
UCI: Mhmm.</br></br>
Caller: December- they started giving us face masks around December of last year.</br></br>
UCI: Mhmm.</br></br>Caller: Before, there was no face masks or nothing.</br></br>
UCI: Mhmm.</br></br>
Caller: They just sprayed bleach on the floor, and that was it.</br></br>UCI: Wow.</br></br>Caller: So, it was pretty, you know, pretty scary, you know, and quite a few detainees got COVID out of this, you know?</br></br>UCI: Mhmm. And what has the vaccination situation been like at your facility?</br></br>Caller:  Well, they finally gave us the vaccination I'd say about two months ago or something like that, if I'm correct, about two months ago.</br></br>
UCI: Mhmm.</br></br>

Caller: Three months ago, something around that area. They gave us the Johnson and Johnson.</br></br>UCI: Mhmm.</br></br>
Caller: Because, you know, the some of those lawyers that fight for us, you know, they demanded, you know, the government to give us the COVID vaccine.</br></br>
UCI: Mhmm.</br></br>
Caller: But they only gave us an option of Johnson and Johnson. That was it.</br></br>
UCI: And you guys didn't have any of the other, like, an option for the other vaccines?</br></br>Caller: No, we weren't offered that here. No.</br></br>
UCI: Mhmm.</br></br>
Caller: Just the Johnson and Johnson.</br></br>
UCI: Mhmm. And how has the COVID situation at your facility affected your loved ones?</br></br>
Caller: Could you repeat that again for me, please?</br></br>
UCI: Yeah. How has the COVID situation at your facility affected your loved ones?</br></br>Caller: Well, you know, we were not able to see our family for almost a year. Before, you know, when the pandemic first started, they stopped all visits.</br></br>
UCI: Mhmm.</br></br>
Caller: And so we weren't able to see them, you know, physically up until, like, I don't know. Sometime after the beginning of this year is when we started getting, you know, the visits.</br></br>UCI: Mhmm.</br></br>
Caller: It's very hard, you know, for our family members. And then here,  there is no contact visits, you know. Some detainees, there's detainees who have been here for, like, four years.</br></br>UCI: Mhmm.</br></br>Caller: You know, it's a very harsh situation here, you know, to be this facility. It was designed, it's a very small county jail, and it was designed only for, you know, having local people.UCI: Mhmm.</br></br>Caller: So not to hold people for long term or facilitate, you know, detainees with, you know, making the lawyer calls or, you know, even just, you know, for basic medical needs. You know, they're not, you know, they're not designed for, you know, for to take care of, you know, prisoners, like, you know, detainees like ourselves, you know?</br></br>UCI: Mhmm. And what do you think would have made the situation at your facility better?</br></br>Caller:  Well, to be honest with you, if they would have - the way that this was designed here, if we weren't here at all, you know, period, you know.</br></br>
UCI: Mhmm.</br></br>Caller: Because we were locked down, you know, with the - we were locked down 19 hours a day. You know, we would come up for, you know, the rest of the hours.</br></br>
UCI: Mhmm.</br></br>
Caller: And you would come out at night, you know, in the morning, and you had, you know, contact with the local, you know, prisoners that were, you know, that come in and out of here, you know, out of this county jail for this county.</br></br>
UCI: Mhmm.</br></br>Caller: So, you know, you were always, you know, kind of fearing for your life, you know, because, you know, you never know if you're going get it, you know. A lot of us did get it, you know?</br></br>UCI: Mhmm. And what is it like now with only [redacted] people in the jail?</br></br>Caller: Well it’s kind of, it's very hard, you know, because there's only [redacted]. You know, it's a little difficult, you know, but, you know, we're all fighting for our freedom. You know, see if we can get our freedom out of here.</br></br>
UCI: Mhmm.</br></br>
 Caller: But it's very, you know, hard and stressful.</br></br>UCI: Mhmm.</br></br>Caller: You know, there was [redacted] before. Now, it's only [redacted], and, you know?</br></br>UCI: Yeah. I imagine that must be very difficult. How have you been coping with the crisis? I'm sorry?</br></br>
Caller: Well, you know, talking to family, you know, and the mental health they offer here is very minimal, to a minimal. So, you know, but, you know, no mental health or anything, you know, to cope with any of these crises here.</br></br>
UCI: Mhmm.</br></br>Caller: So, a lot of us are struggling, you know, with all those issues, you know, related to COVID, stress, and everything, you know?</br></br>UCI: Yeah. Mhmm. Is there anything else you want people to know about your experience?</br></br>Caller: Well, my experience is that, you know, that being detained, you know, has, you know, affected my life greatly, you know. It has, you know, hurt my family, and, you know, basically, put my life in danger, you know, since I'm, you know, I'm diabetic. And thank God, you know, I didn't catch the COVID, but, you know, a lot of people that were sick with diabetes did catch it, but they were released, you know, on the Zepeda except for, you know, just a few of us. And those are the ones that are left here, the [redacted] that weren't eligible for the Zepeda Rivas lawsuit that we filed.</br></br>
UCI: Mhmm.</br></br>Caller: So, it's been really hard, you know, overall, you know, just being in this facility. You know, it's been very hard.</br></br>UCI: Mhmm. I'm sorry to hear about that.</br></br>Caller: It was a [unintelligible], but I don't have the link to it. If you know, if you can, you know, [unintelligible] you will find more about situation here.</br></br>
UCI: Mhmm.</br></br>Caller: And they have a link, you know, where they have a page, you know, where it explains all about, you know, the people that are detained here. And how they're trying to, you know, shut it down for–</br></br>
UCI: Mhmm.</br></br>Caller: - you know, conditions that are here and the mistreatment of, you know, the medical and everything, you know, basically.</br></br>UCI: Mhmm. And I have one more question.</br></br>Caller: Uh-huh.</br></br>UCI: As someone who is diabetic, how has the healthcare changed since the pandemic?</br></br>Caller: Well, you know, it hasn't really changed at all. You know, as far as now, you know, they give you, you know, masks, and then that's pretty much it to wear around here. But other than that, you know, it's the same basic care that they were, you know, giving you here, you know, for the past, you know.</br></br>
UCI: Mhmm.</br></br>Caller: You're still in contact. You're still coming in, you know, not direct contact but close contact with, you know, with people that are coming in and out of jail, you know, from the streets to in custody.</br></br>UCI: Mhmm.</br></br>Caller: So, that's pretty, you know, kind of frightening, you know?</br></br>UCI: Mhmm.</br></br>Caller: And the conditions is still, you know, pretty dirty, you know, and not so clean here. Even in the medical department, it's pretty, you know, pretty sad, you know, the conditions.</br></br>UCI: Yeah. Was there anything else you would like to add?</br></br>Caller: You know, it's just, you know, it was great suffering here, you know, during the pandemic and now, you know, with the COVID-19. So, even though we had the Johnson and Johnson, we are still afraid, you know, for our lives, you know. The new variant might, you know, we might catch it, or, you know, we just don't know. So, we try to be as careful as possible, but sometimes you can't avoid that, being in this place.</br></br>UCI: Mhmm. Yeah. Well, thank you very much for participating in PrisonPandemic and please consider telling your friends about us and seeing if they would like to call in, too.</br></br>Caller: Okay, yeah. Now, they're here. Do you want me to get them right now?</br></br>UCI: If they could, call separately, so I could also give them the consent process.</br></br>Caller: Okay, because they would have to call you another time because the person who did this call, I think they're off of work now.</br></br>UCI: I see.</br></br>Caller: Is that okay we call you tomorrow?</br></br>UCI: Yeah, they can definitely call us tomorrow. Our hours are 5:00 to 9:00.</br></br>Caller: Okay, so, I'll try to get it for tomorrow, okay?</br></br>UCI: Okay, thank you so much.</br></br>Caller: Okay, and then thank you so much. And then if you can check, you know, on the, like I was explaining to you, and then you'll see more information about, you know, the suffering, you know, that goes, especially here, you know, more than any other places, you know?</br></br>UCI: Mhmm.</br></br>Caller: And, you know, the conditions here, you know, and then how people, you know, are trying to shut this down. You know, now it's just [redacted] people here, you know, so that tells you something, you know?</br></br>UCI: Mhmm.</br></br>Caller: Okay. So, you know, if you can pass it around, you know, so maybe it'll help our cause a little bit. You know, well, be aware, you know, of what's going on in here.</br></br>UCI: Mhmm. That sounds good.</br></br>Caller: You know, we would appreciate that so much, you know?</br></br>UCI: Mhmm. Okay. Well, thank you so much for sharing your story, and I hope you have a good day.</br></br>Caller: Okay, and you, also, okay?</br></br>UCI: Okay.</br></br>Caller: Enjoy your night. Thank you.</br></br>UCI: You, too. Mhmm. Okay, bye-bye.
