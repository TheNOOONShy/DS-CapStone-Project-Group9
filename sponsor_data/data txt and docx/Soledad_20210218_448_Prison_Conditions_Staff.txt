Theme: Prison Conditions: Staff


The Solution</br></br>


The CCPOA (Califomia Correctional Peace Officers association), the prison guards union, would have the tax payer believe, that on any given day, that the only thing stopping us fue breathing, unredeemable, murdering, raping, child eating monsters from spilling onto the street like a scene from any zombie movie, and devouring the unsuspecting public,.....is them, the correctional officer.</br></br>
Once they claimed they "walk the toughest beat". A good portion of them don't appear to walk any kind of beat. Before I continue an ugly, but accurate description of guards, make no mistake, prisons are here for a reason. They are full of bad people. The guards have a job to do, most of them do it. Most are respectful. But because of their union, the ones like the ones I am about to describe continue to collect a check and their attitudes, racism, poor work and social ethics destroy morale for staff and inmates alike.</br></br>
Considering the current climate regarding race and lack of public trust towards government, these individuals actually do a great deal of damage and they perpetuate that goes both ways between cop and criminal. The solution to almost everything wrong in prison is carneras, cameras cameras! The California Prison system, and all that it relates to it has become what its become because the CCPOA always has and still does absolutely control the narrative regarding this world behind the wall.</br></br>
I'm certain,......the tax payer, no matter which side of the political aisle they are on, republican, democrat, tough on crime, lock them all up, let them all go,. ....and especially during the current state of the economy, would not stand for what actually goes on in here. If they could see how their tax money is wasted. It is super bowl Sunday.</br></br>
People on the streets are dying, starving, homeless, jobless, etc. All of the kids impacted by this virus, in regard to school will be forever be impacted by this anomaly. Their ability to get higher education, health care, a home, a family, is very uncertain. So it's a stinging insult in my book, to see a morbidly obese, disrespectful prison guard, lean back in his chair, about to break it,.....sweating from sitting, stuffing his face, and watching the super bowl, while pulling a double [because they manipulate the overtime].</br></br>
