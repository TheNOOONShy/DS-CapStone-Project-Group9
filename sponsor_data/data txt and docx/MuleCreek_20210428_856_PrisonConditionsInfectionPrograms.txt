This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Mule Creek.</br></br>


So I say to you PrisonPandemic… what do I say in answer to your questions? Does this help… Two cases of COVID-19 were first recorded at C.I.M. Do you remember?!</br></br>


Well, the C.D.C. officer in charge of “transportation” shipped a bus-load of prisoners from that prison, C.I.M., to San Quentin prison. End result, San Quentin was completely-infected via COVID-19!!! Here’s the point… you would think that “basically” prisoners would stand a better chance of not getting the virus, especially those on “death row!!!”</br></br>


The most secluded human-beings on earth!!! 1st degree-murder!!! Injustice by those who are corrupt and manipulate any situation. To their advantage!!!</br></br>


Soon, every human being here tested positive for COVID-19… up to a total of 12-deaths! Only because of the close proximity and mandated-order forced C.D.C. to vaccinate prisoners first even before those on the outside got to be vaccinated which you're all aware of!!!</br></br>


Was that out of a humanitarian-effect?! Possibly by the moral majority! I think they had no-other-choice!</br></br>


That or release every-one or single-cell every prisoner! No money there is there?! So, just like political-wars, that human governments make money from, at the expense of human-lives, they are now using this disease as the money-machine, “man dominating man to his injury!”</br></br>


The way out and a form of “peace” that helps even prisoners, is that those who qualify, i.e. who have a social security number, can have some stimulus checks that give them a opportunity to buy the things that C.D.C. allows through packages, canteen, helpout their families and even some are generous to share with cellies and those less-fortunate in here! The prisoners who have social-security numbers, but can’t remember them are not able to put in fee these “monies”… As the tax-man won’t send any “if” as you know, do not have a correct SSN#.</br></br>


These people here will-not help, i.e. “custody.” I personally can’t remember my SSN# and I do have one. I was born in New York on October 1955. My mother and father were married in New York City!</br></br>


I am a United-States citizen!!! When I asked my counselor for my SSN#, she said I didn’t have one and that I was on record as not being a United States citizen!!! That’s how safe I’ve felt since this pandemic!!!</br></br>


Last Sunday I went to sleep and I woke up with the whole back of my neck with at least second-degree burns! My right foot was discolored and very swollen! My whole body all-night-long was like I was on fire!!!</br></br>


So hot. That I woke-up “burnt-up!” I have a burn-scar on the back of my neck and on my bottom-foot!</br></br>


The doctor took some blood tests, “said” I would get some kind of “ointment” for the burns on neck and foot. But three-days later… nothing! I’ve been in worse-conditions through-out my “prison-life.” Outside help after many-years can sometimes be complicated.</br></br>


This is why I was glad to hear from your office of interests… it’s a small world. Would it be possible if maybe you could use your “resources” to help me locate my family who still may live in [redacted] and send me their address or phone number? I’m sure their phone number is in the phone book?</br></br>


I’m just trying to locate my SSN# and I’m sure that they can help me get-it, or, if you can give me any help on assisting-me getting my SSN#?! If there’s any office that I can contact by letter and give them some identification to prove who I am?! I know that this may sound strange to you, but I’ve been locked up so long, that I’ve never needed the SSN# till now.</br></br>


I would like to receive some stimulus monies that I can receive as a prisoner legally. If there’s anything you can help me out with in achieving this, it would be of great relief in my present situation.</br></br>


If not and I don’t expect you should as that is not why you contacted-me for. So I apologize if I’ve crossed any boundaries, sincerely.
