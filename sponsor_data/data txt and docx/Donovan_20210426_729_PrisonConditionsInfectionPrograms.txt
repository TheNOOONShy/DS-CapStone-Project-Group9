This story was told by a person incarcerated at Donovan.</br></br>


UCI: So what has the COVID situation been like at your facility?</br></br>


Caller: Well it’s been kinda slow, you know they’ve been locking, they’ve been locking us up for, we’ve been locked out for a while and it just run, they don’t run program you what I mean? Like it used to because they shut it down, so it slowly getting back to normal, you know what I mean?</br></br>


UCI: Yeah.</br></br>


Caller: Yeah, we got our, our vaccine already, you know what I mean?</br></br>


UCI: So I heard, my bad my bad, I heard that, that a breakout just happened at that facility. I don’t know if I’m correct about that.</br></br>


Caller: Yes, it did.</br></br>


UCI: And so, how, how has that situation been like? I don’t know if you were already describing it. I’m sorry if I interrupted.</br></br>


Caller: No, no, see, what had, what had happened is that we were on phase two. They were running, you know, you know, like yard and the game room with other buildings. But then we heard that on A yard broke out, again, so they shut us down. They started testing us again.</br></br>


And I guess today, they, they put us back to phase two, which is the way they had it before the, before the outbreak happened on A yard.</br></br>


UCI: Okay.</br></br>


Caller: And started learning program now, that’s why I’m calling you.</br></br>


UCI: And some questions that I did need to ask is, do, do you know of any like, any members of the population at Donovan currently have COVID?</br></br>


Caller: That I know, not in this building.</br></br>


UCI: Okay, and -</br></br>


Caller: But if they did, they, what they do is they quarantine the whole building. Or they, they have a building on, on a different yard, where they share the people that are quarantined for 20 days.</br></br>


UCI: And -</br></br>


Caller: A week, like about two weeks ago, somebody, somebody, you know, they took somebody in the celly, to that, to that building because they, they, I guess they, they had it.</br></br>


UCI: Okay, and -</br></br>


Caller: But basically nobody like, other than that, nobody has it right here, cause they give us testing like I said, in, on Friday.</br></br>


UCI: Okay, and in regards to the prison staff, do you know any of them, if they got any, any, anything like that?</br></br>


Caller: Well, they leave, like, they, they, like, when they don’t run program, they say they short of staff, it’s because either some of them are protesting that in, and they don’t want to come to work, or, they, they have it, I don’t know, I’m not sure. They don’t tell us who has it or, or who doesn’t because it’s been different CO’s that come in and work in here. So we don’t, we won’t get that information unless we hear, you know like rumours or something, you know what I mean?</br></br>


UCI: Yeah, and how, and to your perspective, how well do you think the staff are handling this current outbreak?</br></br>


Caller: Well, I think, I think it’s alright, you know I mean, you know, I think there are, there has been, you know it’s what anybody can, you know what I mean? I myself, you know, try to stay in the house, try to stay in the cell, instead of coming out, and when I do come out, before anything I, I got my mask on, you what I mean? Cause they give us masks.</br></br>


UCI: And do you have any current concerns?</br></br>


Caller: No. No, no not really you know I mean, as far as I know, cause I, I think like I said I get tested on Friday so I don’t have that. You know, but before that, a whole bunch of people had it, you know what I mean, but did not get quarantined.</br></br>


UCI: Okay.</br></br>


Caller: I just, as a precaution I just stay, I just stay in my cell, you know what I mean, I, as much time I can. Each time I come out, I only come out is to get my, my, my food, my tray, or something like that.
