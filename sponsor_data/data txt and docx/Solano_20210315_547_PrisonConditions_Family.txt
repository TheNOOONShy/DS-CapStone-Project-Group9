This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Solano.</br></br>

Our dorms typically had 10-12 inmates. It became a policy of medical staff, should any inmate in a dorm test positive or self-report flu-like symptoms, the entire dorm is taken and put in quarantine, tested, and possibly could returned in 14-21 days after having two negative tests. This policy is so draconian that inmates refused to self-report out of fear of isolation/quarantine punishment. Neither isolation or quarantine provided any treatment such as over-the-counter medicines, nor were the doctor visits allowed except for emergencies. Nurses took daily temperatures, pulse rate, and oxygen level readings from building to building using the same equipment which were never thoroughly cleaned.</br></br>
 
Buildings seven and nine were used as quarantine buildings while the gymnasiums were used for isolation. At no time were the cells, beds, mattresses, toilet, dayroom,s phones, or drinking fountains ever properly sterilized after each use. As COVID spread rampantly in Solano, nearly half of the inmates ever housed in buildings 7 or 9 ultimately contracted COVID. They came as negative but left positive.</br></br>
 
During this pandemic, correctional staff continuously told inmates that medical was in charge of the mess movements, an order mandated from Sacramento CDCR headquarters. This statement does not nor should it be acceptable to ignore the inmates pleas for help or to dismiss their responsibility for maltreatment and abuse they daily observed. Correctional staff have a responsibility to both inmates and the public to keep every inmate safe.</br></br>
 
There was a dissension in how things were running however no correctional staff attempted to stop the wrongs and their futile attempt to manipulate and redirect fault fell on heaf ears. They were equally culpable for allowing mass movements of inmates which infected the entire prison. To this day, there still exists a disconnect and distrust toward correctional staff as a direct result.</br></br>
 
I personally swabbed (COVID tested) multiple times and everyone being negative. The nurses conducting the swabbings were forceful and unapologetic. The testing was uncomfortable and they did not make it any better. As mentioned before, anytime a single person tested positive for COVID, the entire dorm was moved out and the testing reset. At least once or twice a week, someone was testing positive so the buildings would never come off quarantine until the entire building was moved out.</br></br>
 
On December 12, 2020, medical staff claimed four inmates tested positive on Dec 10th and has been sent into isolation in the gym, my brother being one of them. One hour passed when a new list was created reflecting 40 people were being rolled up for possible contamination and another four were being sent to the gym for isolation. Initially, I was slated to be housing in quarantine (seven building) along with my dormmates. However, correctional staff who knew my brother and I took it upon themselves to move me into the gym to be with him. While it's not my intent to get these individuals in trouble, but it does show that correctional staff did have a significant role in the mess movements.</br></br>
 
My brother experienced every symptom known prior to being tested positive and even passed swab testing twice. Another dormmate also dispaced every tell-tale symptom and he too went undetected for an additional week before testing positive. This feat proves testing fallacy and that temperature, blood pressure, and oxygen testing twice a day by nursing staff failed to disclose any COVID or flu-like symptom.</br></br>
 
My brother still suffers from lingering side effects of COVID. I on the other hand never had any symptom and to this day believe my test was a false/positive. During my time in isolation, nurses came twice daily doing welfare checks and I asked four different nurses for a retest to invalidate the false/positive test. Their replies were: "If you are in this gym, you tested positive and there is no need to retest." Refusing to retest not only me but many like me compounded the belief that some upper-management directive was in place and medical staff's intended to infect as many inmates as possible to create herd immunity.</br></br>
 
The environment in the gym was unsanitary and over-crowded. In the buildings, beds were separated by six feet however this wasn't the case in the gym. Beds were so compacted that they were three feet apart and ultimately, medical and custody staff warehouses 107 inmates by double bunking each bed, a place ordered to be shut down by a federal 3 judge panel. TO make matters worse; dust, mice, and mold as everywhere, the roof leaked severely allowing rain to flood living areas and destroying personal property.</br></br>
 
Still, more and more inmates were brought into the gym. Some inmates had serious health conditions and should have been placed into a cell. Also, inmates from all yards were being corralled into a single environment ensuring that COVID was spread throughout the prison.
