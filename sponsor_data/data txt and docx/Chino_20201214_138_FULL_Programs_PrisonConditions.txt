Hello,</br></br>

A friend of mine that received your info gave it to me because he felt that I too could share my info as well. I'm going to attempt to cover as much as I can in a few words as possible.</br></br>

From the beginning of the pandemic, which in prison started about at the end of March, has been horrible. I am currently based at CIM minimum facility where this staff started in that prison. No one was prepared for this but it could've been handled a lot better than it was and still is.</br></br>

There is nine dorms on this yard well seven dorms and to building that house cell living inmates South and West. I was housed in South dorm. At one point every building was in quarantine except South dorm. Me and my fellow inmates worked long hours doing jobs that we were not trained to do.</br></br> 

I have been working in the custodial trade for about three years but I don't think that I have worked that hard since I was living at home about 25 years ago. But I didn't mind because I take pride in doing my job right. Because I know that I could be responsible to help keep the hospital germ free as possible. I work in the OHU doing the cleaning and house-keeping.</br></br> 

I was one of two hospital workers that was on call. Then my co-worker went on quarantine and I worked my butt off for about a month and a half. I'm still working my butt off and to be honest, none of us are treated well. We should have a bit more respect for all the things that we have done to keep things going.</br></br>

They are forcing people to work in the kitchen and still treating us as a whole like slaves. It's not right. Some of us go to the chow hall to eat and some don't want to go to the chow hall because of fear of the COVID-19.</br></br>

But the COs well mainly the sergeant that works third watch on D-yard who is just an a-hole got COs outside the chow hall patting people down. No social distancing, no changing gloves. They are there to spread and kill us because all we are are a number to them. They moved one inmate here that started this whole thing but they have kept it spreading and by closing the chow hall because thats how it spread last time.</br></br> 

I've seen about three people pass from this. The governor should have let all of us out this minimum yard out. Should have found some kind of way.</br></br>

But I have to go to work if you would like to know more you can write me.</br></br>

Thanks for your time.</br></br>

PS please keep my name out of this. These people retaliate!
