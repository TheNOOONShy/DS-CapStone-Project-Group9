And uhh, before I was transferred I must have known that I had symptoms of the COVID.  [unintelligible] I arrived here and on June 1st I let the medical know that I had the symptoms and so they took me to quarantine over here in [unintelligible] and they did tests. They ran the q-tip in my nose, my mouth and they put me in quarantine. Five days later they told me I was the first inmate in San Quentin prison to have the COVID virus. And--UCI: Oh wow.Caller: Yeah, in about three or four days I noticed uh, there was 120 of us, 124 of us who came from Chino to get away from the virus over there. Within three or four days I noticed the other guys that came on the bus from Chino, arriving at quarantine and they were also having symptoms of the COVID virus. By the day’s over, the RN who tested me, he told me, after he told me that I was the first inmate to be tested positive for the COVID in San Quentin, he told me that he told his staff there were transfers from Chino to San Quentin because his words was, uh Chino [unintelligible] did us dirty by sending us infected inmates from Chino over here. UCI: Mm-huh.Caller: So the last time they tested us for the COVID in Chino was May, uh I believe was May 12th. UCI: Oh wow.Caller: Yeah so it was over, almost three weeks uh so we weren’t tested before we left. And like what happened to the inmates with the [unintelligible] when they gave them the infected blankets, that’s what happened over here. They moved us over from Chino to over here and we infected the whole population. And that um, August uh...August 9th was already 27 inmates of us and one CDC sergeant now got the COVID because we have, we have numerous boxes that are property that have to be unloaded, and they have to be unloaded by inmates.  [unintelligible]  property and within uh, by August 9th, there’s already 2,000, over 2,000 infected inmates. UCI: Oh my goodness.Caller: And uh what happened. Well right now we’re still in quarantine. Between last week and this week there’s two officers that have tested positive. Well and we’re in that environment so  [unintelligible] and there’s no ventilation here [unintelligible]. There’s um the only testing they’re doing to us they’re giving us um uh [unintelligible] testing and just taking our temperatures but that doesn’t they’re not doing no uh blood pressure checks. Not giving no [unintelligible] hand sanitizer. We’ll probably receive uh some of the cloth masks we’ll probably receive um, um I think four of um...um N95 medical masks, we recently just got that. [unintelligible] handing out the cloth mask, so um… there’s no way that they can stop this outbreak ‘cause uh, it’s taking us out uh we’re not, we don’t have no contact with the uh [unintelligible] we’re getting infected from CDC [unintelligible] and uh--UCI: Yeah.Caller: And now the, now I you know I don’t have my [unintelligible] that came off when I need to get a lot of work done. I can’t get any of those work done because um [unintelligible] Sacramento that they cannot use aerosol to air, because it’s a disposable [unintelligible] so anybody that has [unintelligible] problems, they have to deal with the pain or [unintelligible] so um it’s kind of hard for me here.UCI: Yeah it sounds like it. What is the most troubling or concerning to you?Caller: The concerning is uh being away from my family for so long and I have family, I’m from uh San Pedro Valley. And as long as I’m here in in uh San Quentin I’m away from my family, like she has medical problems, my family all have medical problems so as long I’m here, uh it’s bad for my family. My wife’s going through chemotherapy and um, you know I feel bad for her, she’s going through it alone and usually when I was over there in the prison uh we [unintelligible] but uh it’s...I’m on lockdown. [unintelligible] so whoever has the virus and uses the phone, it can pass on to [unintelligible] so it’s just...it’s just uh hard to [unintelligible] we’re on lockdown 24/7 [unintelligible] in uh the size of a room that’s about, most likely a dog in a kennel has more room to move up in the cell.UCI: Yeah.Caller: It’s really small, you can’t even, you can’t even do a push-up, you can’t go outside, so it’s just...it’s just coming from the Chino prison where you have more and more room, up to the San Quentin prison [unintelligible] away from the virus.UCI: Right. What is going okay? Or is anything going okay? Caller: Not really. The CDC is trying to have it under control but, like I said, just last week and today, two officers uh uh tested positive so how can they protect inmates when they can’t protect their own staff. UCI: Right.Caller: So um, and they can’t get medical uh, people who have medical problems [unintelligible] it’s just really rough right now, you know, I understand but [unintelligible] it still doesn’t make uh, it just makes it hard to uh live over there in these tough conditions, especially being off you know, away from family and not being able to get medical you know issues treated. UCI: Right. And I know you talked about you know changing facilities, but like how do things look different now than at the beginning of the outbreak? I mean you can talk about, you know how things changed over the time, or you know how the things have changed at the different facilities. Caller: Well here, I mean here uh it’s a time of change but it can’t it can’t, these prisoners [unintelligible] there’s no ventilation, no windows or anything so they can can’t really do very much and so with everything that happened [unintelligible] you know…UCI: Right.Caller: In Chino at least in Chino they have [unintelligible] underneath, we can walk around or go up in a little upper [unintelligible] over here in [redacted] [unintelligible] a bathroom and uh and they can’t even wash themselves [unintelligible] body [unintelligible] Marin County sheriff is telling the San Quentin warden to release you know at least half the inmates because of the virus and the warden said he is not going to release nobody, you know so...the [unintelligible] CDC is not trying to uh help us you know stay helpful, they can’t because there’s so many people [unintelligible].UCI: Right. What would make the situation at your facility better? Caller: Uh this prison being so old, uh they’d have to put new ventilation, uh in the buildings, which they can’t...uh [unintelligible] they’re putting us now in front if the inmates have one man cells and other parts they still have two-men cells in the sides of the bathrooms and you know uh, um…[unintelligible] I mean there’s nothing they can really do to make it better. Starting now, [unintelligible] a couple times a month for inmates [unintelligible]. Caller: Other than that um, I don’t see anything [unintelligible] so...alright, well I’ll pass it on to my [unintelligible]. UCI: Right.Caller: [unintelligible] I also wrote to [unintelligible]. UCI: Yes, and thank you for participating. Caller: [unintelligible] UC Irvine for [unintelligible] uh thank you very much. UCI: Okay thank you, bye.Caller: Alright, bye. End of recording.
