This story was told by a person incarcerated at Kings County Jail.</br></br>Caller: But in the prison systems and things like that, I was explaining to your - a lot of your - some of your fellow classmates; they do a lot of things they shouldn't be doing inside of prisons, you know? Showing your paperwork to people. People get their lives taken.</br></br> That's why a lot of you try to read the paper and see certain things, people dying in prison, getting stabbed, and their death, you know what I mean? A lot of times, that's what happens. A lot of times, they do not explain to you what is behind.</br></br>See - see the correctional officers? All they're doing is guess - they're doing guesswork. They don't truly know what is behind.</br></br>They're just going off of what they think and what they - what they're finding, but they - but they don't know. They don't know that man ain't - they don't - they're really not going to tell you the truth because a lot of documents, a lot of things are falsified, and reports are - are, you know, you know, tampered with.
