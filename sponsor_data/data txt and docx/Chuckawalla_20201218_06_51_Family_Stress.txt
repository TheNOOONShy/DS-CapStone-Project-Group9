This story was told by a person incarcerated at Chuckawalla.</br></br>UCI: Have you seen it where, you know, we talk about the pandemic and we’re very much aware of what’s going on. Have you seen this, though, with other viruses because of the overcrowding?</br></br> 

You know, just with a common cold, or the flu, or any other kind of ailment that is very similar, but because, you know, in society we can social distance. It’s practically very similar to what you’re going through?</br></br>  Caller: Oh yes. We’re offered the flu shot if we would like. A few years ago, I did get the flu. I was hit worse with just a common flu about three or four years ago, than I was with the COVID-19.</br></br> 

I had chills, headaches. I was in bed for a week. And the common cold, you know, a couple of people get it within, you know, a week everybody is sniffling or got common cold. So, it’s a common, it’s a common thing in the environment we live in.</br></br>  UCI: That’s - yeah, and I think that’s so important, you know, to address with the overcrowding right? Like you were saying, that’s a huge component of why you guys are experiencing what you’re experiencing.</br></br> 

As far as, you know, how your family, I mean, how are you coping with it? Have you been telling family and friends, or, you know, loved ones?</br></br> 

Have you been sharing your story with them? Or what’s been going on? Or, have you been keeping it a little bit quiet? </br></br>  Caller: I talk to my, a member of my family once a week, and I keep my family member informed. Again, if you’ve never experienced it, it’s very hard to understand the life.</br></br> 

This is a whole new social system hidden from most people in society. And if you don’t have a family member in, and you don’t, can't picture how the life is in here. It’s very difficult.
