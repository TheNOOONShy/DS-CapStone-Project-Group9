Dear PrisonPandemic Project,</br></br>

I received your letter (which was undated) today. May I suggest that you date your form letters if you send out more? The reason is that jails — at least the Orange County Jail — are very sensitive to outside “interference,” and sometimes delay delivery, mis-deliver, or “lose” mail. Having the date of mailing (not always decipherable from the postmark) would help incarcerated recipients who actually get your correspondence to determine if the mail was purposely delayed.</br></br>

My other suggestion is that if your professor has an attorney friend who would allow use of his or her address, you could send letters marked “legal mail” (in red is best — a stamp and stamp pad or program your printer) and the jail would not be able to even open it outside the incarcerated person’s presence — only inspect it for contraband but not read it. I have received such letters on behalf of the ACLU requesting information.</br></br>

In fact, the ACLU has operated a hotline for about a year. Many of the concerns directed to them about jail conditions have related to the pandemic. If you could obtain their pandemic complaints without the names, you would have a convenient cornucopia of data for your sociological study. I assume that an academic article is the goal of your inquiries.</br></br>

Now to respond to your request for information about how the pandemic has impacted people in the OC jail(s). When the pandemic first hit in 2020, the jail promptly used to the jail’s advantage. What I mean by that is family visits were immediately suspended (which are done through plexiglass using telephones and therefore posed no risk of transmitting the virus).</br></br>

Such visits are a substantial inconvenience to the Orange County Jail, because they must be supervised by deputies and they create opportunities for family to physically observe “inmates” (a euphemism for “prisoner” used to convey the idea that the prisoners here are being treated humanely). Visits also create opportunities for prisoners to convey grievances to family members, who may then attempt to remedy those grievances through communication with the management staff of the jail or community advocates.</br></br>

Many prisoners are barely literate, and their families may not be able to afford the telephone charges to be able to speak to prisoners. To use jail telephones, family members must set up an account with the company that contracts with the sheriff’s department Global Tel Link, and pay rates of 14 cents to 21 cents per minute. Also, once the account is set up, family must pay a deposit each time to fund the account with a 25 cent minimum, of which GTL immediately takes 20 percent.</br></br>

(GTL is a corporation with hundreds of millions of dollars in annual revenue. GTL ensures its relationship with sheriffs throughout the country by secretly recording prisoners’ attorney-client phone calls and giving them to the sheriff’s deputies who then listen to them and/or provide them to prosecutors. This has been discovered in Orange County, California and Pinellas County, Florida. See articles in the Orange County Register by Tony Saavedra).</br></br>

The jail also suspended visits from clergy. Only attorneys were allowed to visit. In April of this year, the jail began allowing one family visit per month by appointment only, even though local non-essential businesses have been allowed to operate at 50 percent capacity or more for months. Before the pandemic, a family member could visit weekly without an appointment during regularly scheduled hours Friday-Monday inclusive.</br></br>

When the pandemic first broke in March 2020, the only “masks” the jail would give us were cut up pieces of sad bare sheets. While the jail started giving lip service to social distancing, it is impossible in jail. It took a couple of months to get disinfectant and paper towels in the “day room” for those of us held in cells (I’ve been in one for eight and a quarter years). The dorms (bunk beds lined up about three feet apart) were hit the worst.</br></br>

I am aware (secondhand, but reliable) of five deaths. The sheriff has lied to the press and said one. In the dorms, inmates were intentionally sharing water bottles under the mistaken belief that they would be released promptly if positive for COVID. Some inmates were eventually released, but it took pressure and a lawsuit from the ACLU to accomplish it.</br></br>

With outside pressure, after a couple of months (when the ACLU had taken action) the jail started providing real masks. But the only thing the jail did about social distancing was post signs until there were multiple complaints by medically vulnerable prisoners to the ACLU, the jail did not start endorsing the use of masks, and even then, enforcing was sporadic. Ironically, where I am confined in the medical unit, the worst offenders going maskless were the deputies.</br></br>

When medically vulnerable inmates were transported to court, they were placed in holding cells with other inmates from other confirmed in other areas of the jail. Because jails have replaced former “insane asylums” the jail population fluctuates around 25 percent mentally ill prisoners. Expecting them to wear masks consistently and maintain social distance is unrealistic. Thus, any time a prisoner leaves the jail (court or medical appointment) s/he will be exposed to persons who may be positive and may spread it to cell or dorm mates upon return to the jail.</br></br>

As for vaccinations go, the jail started in February, but after vaccinating people over 65 and those with underlying medical conditions, the jail switched from Pfizer to Johnson & Johnson (the blood clot vaccine), and if a prisoner refused to accept the single shot of J&J s/he were told that they would get nothing. At least one nurse acknowledged that the medical staff preferred J&J because it took less of their time to administer. Right now there are people in my cell block who have signed forms requesting vaccination as long ago as two months that are still waiting.</br></br>

The other thing that happened right after the pandemic broke was a significant change in the food provided. Initially, the jail switched from hot breakfasts and hot dinners to serving cold lunch three times daily: institutional bologna (not for retail sale — it’s made by sweeping up all the unwanted scraps on the slaughter house floor, grinding it up, and pressing it into circular slices) four slices of bread and an apple or orange, half pint of skim milk was served at breakfast and dinner (as well as a small package of institutional cookies with almost no nutritional value).</br></br>

This went from March - August 2020. In August, we got hot meals back, but they were cancelled again in early December. We now get cold cereal, peanut butter, or two hard-boiled eggs for breakfast and bread, but lunch and dinner are still bologna. About two months ago they finally added a small package of carrots every other day at lunch.</br></br>

The excuse for stopping hot meals is that they don’t have enough “inmate workers.” There are still 3,000 prisoners here (approximately), and plenty that would work for free (they don’t get paid — it’s the equivalent of slave labor) just to have something to do besides sitting in a cell all day. The jail also stopped providing books when the pandemic hit, so unless a prisoner has family who can buy brand new books from an acceptable online seller, books may be hard to get.</br></br>

I believe that I’ve covered the pandemic issue as thoroughly as I can. Good luck with your research and whatever academic article comes from it.</br></br>

Sincerely.</br></br>

PS You might get more responses by telling prisoners what you are studying and how their responses might help advance changes in the criminal injustice system. Also, acknowledging that you don’t know us personally makes sense, but then pretending you know us well enough to “know you’ve got what it takes to get through it” is a bit silly and a little insulting.</br></br>

It would also be better received if the names were typed, as in word processed, so even though it’s a form letter it isn’t quite so obvious. Even though we are prisoners, not all of us are low functioning. You also might want to put the address to which you want prisoners to reply in the letter. And keep in mind that the jail screens incoming and outgoing mail.
