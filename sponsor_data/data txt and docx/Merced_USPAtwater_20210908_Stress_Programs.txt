This letter is written by a person incarcerated at Merced USP Atwater Federal Center.</br></br>

With all this being said allow me to properly introduce myself. As I’m sure you are already aware that my name is [redacted]. I’m 31 years old, and I’m not from California, I’m born and raised in Florida. I’ve been down seven years and have a few more till I reach my release.</br></br>

I won’t go into no prison politics and will stay on course as to what’s going on inside here during these trying times. Also I will answer your question to the best of my ability and my personal experiences and point of view.</br></br>

For the most part doing your time is what you make it. As for me specifically, I'm all about productivity. I’m in a special housing unit in the prison that promotes change. It’s called the [redacted] which is a program of inmates that all have similar struggles and want to change for the better and become productive members in society.</br></br>

I’m all for rehabilitation and reform. No matter the ethnic background or race. In this program we support one another. So to answer your question, yes it is a little lonely, depressing, and frustrating being incarcerated on top of it being a pandemic and to add on being confined within these walls. But there is things to help us cope. Like I already mentioned this program brings inmates together like a community so we support one another.
