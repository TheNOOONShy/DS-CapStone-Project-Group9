This story was told by a person incarcerated at Fresno County Jail.</br></br>

Caller: I'm currently on quarantine in my facility. They stopped everything. We can't see our family. We can't go to court. Certain people had to go home.</br></br>

And in order to go home, they have to go to a certain court date. They're not going to do that. They stopped all trials for us to fight for ourselves. I have a friend who's been going to trial, and they stopped it.</br></br> 

And that, they stopped everything between the court dates. Like I said, it's hectic. They're transferring people from different quarantine facilities to other quarantine facilities, which is not right because people are getting sick.</br></br>

When the correctional officers come in and do count, they're not resupplying their self with gloves; they're not resupplying their self with cover wear. Sometimes we have to write a complaint about the correctional officer using their masks. We feel that they should resupply their stuff, being, how would you say, more alert about what they're doing?</br></br>

I think the facilities should be more cautious in screening. I think they should keep track of certain individuals who have COVID-19 coming from the streets.</br></br>

We were on, for a while, we weren't doing, we weren't on quarantine until a person came in here after, I say, about three days, he came up with, he had symptoms. After three days of being in here, he had symptoms. But they removed him, but still, that doesn't give the right to put us on quarantine because of one person they let go through and didn't screen right. I don't see that's fair.</br></br>

UCI: So, for new people coming in, are they getting quarantined?</br></br>

Caller: No, they're getting screened from out of the jail facility, the correction facility. They're getting screened before they come in, but I figure if they're getting screened out before they come in, why are they still getting sick? Why are they having symptoms after three days? I don't understand if they're getting screened before they come in here.</br></br>

People are getting sick. The people that have been here for a long time and have already been screened, well, before the pandemic, we're getting sick. I've been sick three times. The first one was a month and a half being sick, the second one was two weeks being sick, and the third one was three days being sick.</br></br> 

Okay, I have not got sick after that, but a lot of people that were in here with me, that have been here as long as I have, they're getting sick.
