This story was told by a person incarcerated at Chino.</br></br>

UCI: Do you remember when the first people started to get sick there? Do you know what month?</br></br>

Caller: The first one was – I don't remember the first one exactly, but I know the second one was around September, the beginning of September.</br></br>

UCI: What else would you like people to know about your experience?</br></br> 

Caller: Okay um, on the letter that I got, they were talking about like to explain how it has affected us with getting visits and all that? Okay, well, I think that's a big part when it comes to staying healthy you know like in your mind and everything when you have contact with your family, when you see them, and when you talk to them. And when they stopped that out of nowhere, they haven't even been trying to find new ways to give us visits.</br></br>

And what they do is they're letting you have video visits with your family. But it's only – they're only letting 10 people or 15 people, and unfortunately that's not enough.</br></br>

But it just takes a toll on your mind. And I mean everybody is like– you can feel the hostility because of people being – if they take everything you care for and we can't basically have that contact, people just don't care anymore. They're like, "Well, whatever" you know?
