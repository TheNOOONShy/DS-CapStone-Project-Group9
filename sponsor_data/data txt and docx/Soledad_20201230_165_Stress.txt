This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Soledad.</br></br>

I haven't seen the ambulance in a couple of days. That's a good thing. I feel anxious for this to all be over and for normal program to continue.</br></br> 

It's a scary time to be in prison with COVID-19. We can't talk to our loved ones normally due to this pandemic. We were not able to go to canteen in December because it’s affected the staff. So for Christmas we didn't get any store. The small things mean a lot to a prisoner. Store is a lot. The food that the CDC provides isn't very good or enough to eat.</br></br> 

I've lost over 100 pounds since I've been in prison just over a year. Medical takes time in prison. A bunch of red tape. I have medical issues. I don’t know what's wrong with me but my stomach hurts. The water in prison is hard and a lot of calcium buildup in the water system. When you warm up water in a hot pot there is calcium buildup that you always have to keep your hot pot clean.</br></br> 

I don't like to complain at all. I just wish people took this pandemic seriously.
