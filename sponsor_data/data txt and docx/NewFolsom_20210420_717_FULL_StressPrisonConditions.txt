This letter was written by a person incarcerated at New Folsom.</br></br>Hello, first off I would like to thank you for reaching out to me at this time. I think that what you and your team are doing is amazing. At the beginning of the pandemic things were the worst, we had no idea what was going on the whole prison system shut down over night.</br></br>We had been told that we would not be able to see our love one’s, but we never thought that it would be a whole year before we will get the chance to see them again. They gave us all mask and informed us that our program as we knew it to be was over.</br></br>We had to stay confined to our cells for days at a time before we were able to go outside to get fresh air. We got to use the phone less often which created fear and stress in me not being to know if my family was ok and not infected with the COVID-19.</br></br>Everyday I would hear about someone around me that got infected that I had come into contact with, this of course scared me because I did not trust the CDCR prison system to give me the best health care if I was infected. Through pure luck or the grace of god I did not catch the COVID-19.</br></br>Also there was some good that came from this. I got three months taken off my sentence which helped me out a lot because now I will get out this year. Also not being able to be around all the other inmates kept me out of trouble.</br></br>I didn’t lose anyone to the pandemic I’m always grateful for that. I’ve been vaccinated just about everyone here has had the chance. Some refused. I know it’s not much but it’s my story. Thank you for being willing to listen to it.</br></br>Thank you.
