Dear PrisonPandemic,</br></br>

Thank you for the encouraging letter. I gotta say, this COVID-19 pandemic was hell on my mental health. As far as being inside during this pandemic, the way it was handled was haphazard to say the least.</br></br>

This prison from the time this pandemic for the first 10 months went without a single case. Then for reasons unknown, they placed resolved inmates from other institutions into every building except building 19. From there, the outbreak was beyond control Affecting every building but building 19.</br></br> 

We were packed together like sardines, no social distancing, and treated as if we were lab rats.</br></br>

No, I do not feel as if my safety is of any concern to this prison. However, as a prisoner serving LWOP, I don’t think they care either way.</br></br>

Visiting as of late hasn’t been a factor for me even before the pandemic. My dad has cancer and can no longer travel. My mom is losing her eyesight due to diabetes and can’t travel, especially this far. As for the rest of my family, I’m only in touch with my sisters and two aunts in Philadelphia.</br></br>

If it weren’t for God, I’d have ended it long ago. I’ve learned to cope doing the un-copable (if that’s a word) and to be thankful for what I do have, it’s more than some.</br></br>

They are making an effort to vaccinate everyone however slow they are at going about doing it. They have followed the guidelines for the most part, I received the first dose 2/20/21 and awaiting the second.</br></br>

Again, thank you for the letter, it was a blessing. Take care and God bless you.</br></br>

Sincerely.
