Hello PrisonPandemic,</br></br>

Thank you for the card you sent but are you sure the letters on the card were big enough? I was glad to get it. If I could I would like to update you on my COVID-19 condition.</br></br>

I still have breathing issues. And sometimes I lose my balance leaning forward or side to side, nothing serious but still I don’t like it. OK, thanks again for the card if you want write back if you have any questions. Bye for now.
