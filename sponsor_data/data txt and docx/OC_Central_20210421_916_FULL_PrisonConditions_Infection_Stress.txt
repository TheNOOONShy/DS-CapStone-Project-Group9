This letter was written by a person incarcerated at OC Central.</br></br>

Hello to whom this may concern. Well yes hi, this is new to everyone inside & out of jail. As for myself I’m dealing with a lot on my plate. I just (sing) two years w/ half upstate! So my time here in county jail will be spent here shortly. Thank God for that, because the way things are here suck.</br></br>

“Three” sack lunches a day w/ four slices of bread, four bologna, fruit and the smallest cookies I ever seen to feed a man. By all means I am a Southern Hispanic dealing w/ county politics. Lol to make life that much better (I’M IN HELL FOR CRYING OUT LOUD)!</br></br>

They do offer the pandemic shot. I took the Pfizer shot. I kinda felt sick afterwards, however overcame it three days later. Besides your letter, which my only letter receiving since I’ve been down for three months, what can I say. I’m alive, breathing & I pray & thank my Lord & Savior JESUS. For another day in this pandemic. Thanks for the concern & hope my letter was of any help on my end.</br></br>

One Love & God Bless Truly…!
