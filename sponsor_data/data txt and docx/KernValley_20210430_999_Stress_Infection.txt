This letter was written by someone incarcerated at Kern Valley.</br></br>In the name of Allah the beneficent, the most merciful. Dear PrisonPandemic, may Allah’s peace, blessings and mercy be upon you and your family.</br></br>I received your letter during this month of Ramadan which is very rewarding for me on all levels. It’s a time for self-reflection, seeking forgiveness, redemption, moral growth, sacrifice, accountability, responsibility, awareness towards being a positive productive human being!</br></br>I’m in good health mentally, spiritually, emotionally, and physically. At 61 years young with sound mind and fear understanding of the severity of this global pandemic along with the destruction it has caused!</br></br>Prior to me coming to prison, I’ve traveled all over the world. Once it was announced that this was a pandemic, I immediately covered my mouth and hope anytime I was outside of my cell, long before they started passing out mask here. I no longer tough, embrace, or shake hands with anyone.</br></br> 

I’ve been fully vaccinated.</br></br>Some inmates and staff refused to heed the warning signs therefore many people caught the virus here. There were quite a few deaths, how many I don’t know. I do know a lot of staff lost their lives.</br></br> 

Quite a few inmates have refused to take the vaccine. Although I do believe at least 60 percent or better of the inmate population here has been vaccinated. Programming and visiting is returning to normal slowly.</br></br>Myself and others have been separated from our families and loved one’s due to the distance of where we come from. As well as more than 20 years of incarceration which brings about the “out of sight out of mind” syndrome. That happens over time to so many of us including myself.</br></br> 

My safety has been okay. I keep myself isolated from other inmates until they make mask wearing mandatory and started the vaccinations.</br></br>  

I keep my cell well cleaned and disinfected at all times. I work out at least three days per week, one hour to one hour and a half hours due to my age. I cut back on my food intake because it’s a starch heavy diet that the body breaks down into sugar. I drink much more water now, plus I stay on top of my body and weight as well.
