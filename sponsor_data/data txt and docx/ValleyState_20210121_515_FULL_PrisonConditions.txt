Hello PrisonPandemic,</br></br>

Your message finds me in good health. Thank you for caring. Yes, we all incur difficulties and challenges in our lives. These times are particularly different due to the effect of the pandemic on us individually and as a community.</br></br>

I am a long-term prisoner accustomed to adversities and events I cannot alter or mitigate, so adapting to extreme change is a way of life.</br></br>

I appreciate your confidence (encouragement) for my ability to “...get through it.” and knowing “...people are thinking...and hoping...everyone...gets through this…” I too share your hopes for all people.</br></br> 

You want my story!  I have one, but I determine the task composing too daunting to perform. I will commit to answering some of your example question. Safety: CDCR, and CDCR Medical seem to be attempting to prevent the spread of the virus.</br></br>

Medical and custody are inept (maybe as a defense), and cause more infection and death than prevent (here at VSP) due to overcrowding (200% in most rooms). 

I am grateful authorities (for the most part) are well intended, but Cal. Dept. of Corrections and Medical have a disgraceful history of killing California prisoners.</br></br>

Trusting this authority apparatus to keep me safe is not something I can do. I resign myself to the inevitable, stay healthy, hope and pray. A recent example of CDCR criminal medical malpractice is the eugenic(s) corruption.</br></br> 

I can establish expectations of legitimate medical preventative practice in Cal. prisons based on prison authority history including the above recent incidence.</br></br> 

Thank you again for your confidence in me. At this time I am isolated. Once I can make contact, I have someone in mind may be interested in sharing with PrisonPandemic Project, UCI. If there are any specific questions I may answer please do not hesitate to write.</br></br> 

Sincerely.
