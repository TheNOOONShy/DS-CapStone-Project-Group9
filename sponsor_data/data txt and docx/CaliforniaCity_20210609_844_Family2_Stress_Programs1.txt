This story was told by a person incarcerated at California City.</br></br> 

UCI: Wow. And how's the reduced visitations like? Are you guys have no visitations at all, not even like-</br></br>

Caller: For, like what? Like the first - I think it was like the first year after, from February - yeah, from February to like March - February or what when it hit, 2020?</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>

Caller: To March - to March 2021, there was no visits.</br></br>

UCI: Oh.</br></br>

Caller: No contact, no virtual. They barely started doing virtual visits and then the contacts this - in March of this year.</br></br>

UCI: Oh, wow. So, it's been a whole year, more than a year.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, it's been a whole year. That's what I'm saying. I went a whole year without seeing them, you know?</br></br>

UCI: Yeah. That's got to be pretty stressful on your part.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, it's stressful. Well, you know that, yeah, everybody copes with it their own way in here, you know?</br></br>

UCI: Yeah. Are you guys allowed to like do exercise in like outside or something or?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah. They would let us go to the yard, right? But that's the thing. Is that they had the exercise equipment closed until, like, I want to say, like a month ago.</br></br>

They barely opened it up. When all the gyms were in like - gyms in the streets were opened at - like Orange County, LA - there were gyms that opened at, I think, 50 capacity, half capacity or something like that. They didn't even have no equipment open up over here.
