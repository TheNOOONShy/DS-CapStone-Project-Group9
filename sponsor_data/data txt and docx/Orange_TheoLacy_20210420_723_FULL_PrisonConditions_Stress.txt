Hi PrisonPandemic,</br></br> 

First off, let me thank you for reaching out to me. During these hard times, just reaching out means a whole lot. Right now being away from family and love ones is crazy, because I really didn’t think I take these things for granted.</br></br> 

Well, I would like for you to write me back and tell me about yourself. Do you mind becoming my penpal? It’ll be a cool to have things to look forward to. Since the pandemic, the jail has to stop providing visiting, hot meals and programs.</br></br>

Being locked up right now is really rotting me alive, wasting precious time away from everything and everybody that matters. Orange County Jail System is not where I’ll be coming back to once I beat this case they’re trying to pin on me.</br></br>

Everything is totally messed up that court cases are being moved and cancelled without knowing. There’s a lot of things wrong with everything that this system is putting us through. I’m not that knowledgeable in law or anything else pertaining to how we’re being treated.</br></br>

These lawyers that are suppose to be helping us doesn’t feel like it. We’re not able to get the help and information we need to build our own defense, or just getting out own concrete information that doesn’t have us second guessing everybody’s word.</br></br> 

I’m cutting things here. I also wanted to ask, does this PrisonPandemic Project you guys got going is able to help me out with books, magazines, or updates with the present current crisis?
