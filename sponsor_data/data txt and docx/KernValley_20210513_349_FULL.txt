This story was told by a person incarcerated at Kern Valley.</br></br>Good day to you and do excuse the intrusion upon your day but allow me a moment of your time. Your letter was received on May 5, 2021, so where do I begin? When I heard about the pandemic I tripped out because seeing how people were passing away and contracting COVID-19 was a shock. I was so worried about my loved ones and hoping they didn’t get COVID-19 or pass away from it. I wasn’t worried about myself because I didn’t think anyone would get it in Kern Valley because no one got the virus.</br></br>Last year my grandmother got sick and contracted the virus, was put on a ventilator, and passed away. It was a shock to hear she got sick from “COVID” because she didn’t go anywhere besides her doctor’s appointments. For me, I don’t know why this virus spread so rapidly and killed all these people, but I’m glad there is a vaccine that we can take to prevent us from getting real sick.</br></br>It was a bummer visits got shut down, but I understand the precautions CDCR implemented so an outbreak wouldn’t occur. In October I got real real sick, but it was from something called “Valley Fever” and I almost passed away from it. While in the hospital and being treated for the “Valley Fever”, people were being admitted to the hospital from other prisons with COVID-19 and people were starting to receive positive tests. I tested negative, but when I was released and sent to the infirmary, I tested positive for COVID-19, and it threw me for a whirlwind. I honestly believed I was going to get real real sick and pass away. I didn’t know what to think but I was so concerned for my family and if I died what was to become of them and would they be able to cope with the passing of me ?</br></br>I’m so glad I pulled through and am doing better. The country is getting vaccinated and there is a decline in the COVID-19 contractions. I have had other family members contract the virus, but they pulled through as well. I’m glad that visits are now opening up and becoming a normal program once again and my family is so happy they’ll be able to come down to visit me once again.</br></br>This pandemic was so crazy and scary, but it’s now on decline, less deaths, more vaccinations are being conducted and my health is much much better. Thank you for reaching out and taking the time to get at me. It’s very much highly appreciated, and may you enjoy the rest of your day.</br></br>

With Respect.
