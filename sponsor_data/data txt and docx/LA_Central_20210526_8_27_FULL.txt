This story was told by a person incarcerated at LA_MensCentral.</br></br>

UCI: What facility are you currently housed at?</br></br>

Caller: Los Angeles County Men’s Central Jail.</br></br>

UCI: Awesome. Okay and so, how has the COVID situation been like at your facility?</br></br>

Caller: Okay well I’m just transferred down from a different state prison to Los Angeles County Men’s Central Jail and I was, it’s probably one of the most horrendous processes anybody could ever [unintelligible]. Due to the simple fact that, the processing for COVID inmates and how they’re treating people.</br></br>

Like, for instance, I was basically made to stay in a paper suit for two days that I was transferred in, in a freezing cold room with no blankets, dirty, filthy, rotten conditions, begging for a blanket. And none of the, none of the deputies or free staff would help me.</br></br>

UCI: Wow. And so, considering that, what, you know what, did you get, did you receive that? After or any time after that?</br></br>

Caller: So, after two days, then I finally was housed. It literally was over, over a week before I even seen a bar of soap. It’s like, just the whole process, the cleaning process, the sanitation.</br></br>

And one deputy says, “Hey,” he tells me, “We’re just not equipped to deal with COVID and I’m sorry, you need to appeal it.” You know what I mean? Still to this date they won’t give me an appeal issue. I got here on [redacted] of May to Los Angeles County Men’s Central Jail.</br></br>

UCI: You know, considering all those conditions and everything, how has the vaccination process been like?</br></br>

Caller: So, what they did, just recently in the last couple days, a team of, first they came through and asked anybody who wanted to get vaccinated to let them know that alright they’ll be there. And then they showed up, like early, early morning hours, And the program that I’m in right now, they’ll leave the TVs on until four in the morning at 100 percent so people don’t sleep.</br></br>

So, a majority of people said yeah, I’ll take the vaccination. When they showed up they were just too tired to even get up. But there was a lot of questions about the Moderna and especially, like, the Johnson and Johnson vaccination.</br></br>

And a lot of people were resistant to taking it in concern for their safety and well-being. And the nurse, I just, I was really surprised at the inadequate questions, or not questions but the information that was provided on the vaccination as far as any harmful side effects or what the, anything.</br></br>

They just said, “Oh they’re just, they’re going through the process.” It was just kind of baffling to me that they were just so vague on the thing. And only a few people maybe out of about ten people that signed up took it.</br></br>

UCI: Okay, and how have you been dealing with the whole crisis? Like, with the vaccine going on and with the situations that you’ve been handling…</br></br>

Caller: Well, I myself, I caught COVID. I’m sorry, I didn’t let you finish, but I caught COVID twice. I got it in January, February of 2000 and let’s say 20, and then I got diagnosed with it actually in August of 2020 at Avenal State Prison.</br></br>

UCI: And so…</br></br>

Caller: We had, it was crazy because we had the most cases of any [unintelligible]. I personally know three people that were actually affected and died from COVID which is really kind of a sad thing because I know that the policies, the procedures, the cleaning practices, the hand sanitation, that just wasn’t there.</br></br>

Even before COVID even hit, we were saying that the free staff would bring it into us. “Why aren’t you wearing your mask, why can’t we get masks?” We weren’t provided with none of that PPE until after everything hit and everybody got sick.</br></br>

And it’s just so, I look at it like, how many inmates died throughout the state of California? And you look at the number of, of COs and stuff that died and I wish people would ask, “Why did so many inmates have to die and so few employees and police?”</br></br>

Well, when us inmates got sick with COVID, they pushed us all into a small, confined area of just the people that were diagnosed sick, even though other people were getting sick. They were moving us at 12, one o’clock in the morning and disrupting our living environments where…</br></br>

They knew if we were housed together and there was a few people were sick, the chances are the majority of people were sick.  And so, they moved us, dislocated us from our primary living locations, and shoved all sick people together. And when you put sick people with sick people, we got sicker.</br></br>

Like myself, I didn’t have the symptoms that I had when they finally put me with the sick people. And I sat there and I reported how bad I was feeling. And I got a chance to get my prison records and stuff and the nurses that they brought in and hired just to come in and take our vitals and stuff, they didn’t know nothing.</br></br>

They falsified a lot of paperwork and the reason I didn’t go man down and get further help is because they were just leaving, you know I been down for 21 years. They were just leaving people’s property there and leaving it there for two weeks.</br></br>

Somebody could steal it, ransack it. And I have a lot of legal documents, I’m back down in LA County on a resentencing hearing and I got a chance to maybe go home, you know, so it was crazy.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, and you know, referring back to the question, how did you cope with the situation?</br></br>

Caller: For me, it was just, just stressful, and just very disheartening to see the callousness and the treatment that we received by prison officials. Like one point, they had a section of people that got guilty, got guilty, got found sick with COVID.</br></br>

And so, they tried to remove surrounding people around them to try to stop the spread of the disease and they refused to move. So, they came in and they threatened us and tried to get us all to sign a waiver that we wouldn’t sue them if we agreed to live with the people that were infected or they brought infected people in.</br></br>

People that were housed with infected people, they brought them into our environment and that’s what had caused the outbreak in the first part. So, it was all very just, very I guess you’d say stressful, it was alarming, it was concerning because they weren’t…</br></br>

They sent me, I was a porter so they sent me to a training course with, to how to handle and treat COVID cleanup and stuff like that. And all the information we received was basically all, it was a lie. And the people that were putting on the orientation were people that were infected and sick with COVID in the first place.</br></br>

UCI: And so, going further is that, you guys had reduced visitation and programming, and you know, how was that like?</br></br>

Caller: Oh, that sucks. I mean, you’ve gotta, my hat’s off to so many prisoners that got regular visits and regular family visits and stuff. And they’ve just for the last, basically, been going on two years with no visits from loved ones and it’s, it’s tremendously…</br></br>

I think that prisoners overall, in my level two facility, I don’t know. I’m not speaking for all levels of prison, but in my level two, I was very surprised that inmates were able to, to, I guess, handle it.</br></br>

And unfortunately, at my prison, they started, I don’t know a lot of people don’t realize this, but they started a program of, they give these inmates Suboxone and they give it to any inmate. And it’s also disheartening to me at the same time because there was such an influx of people getting, people that have never done heroin and stuff were getting basically free drugs, Suboxone.</br></br>

And so I hate to say it but it was so inundated, that I think that played a major part of people keeping their cool. They’re basically high on Suboxone, the majority of the people that [unintelligible]. But it, overall, I was surprised that people were able to maintain and to cope with the loss of the family visiting and visits in general.</br></br>

UCI: That’s interesting. And what, in your perspective, how would you have handled all this differently? Say, if you were the head of the prison?</br></br>

Caller: Well, it’s really simple. First off, they needed to screen the incoming, you know they had officers working in buildings that were affected and they had them come work overtime which was a possible contamination point. They had, I worked on a level one support yard, level two support yard, so a lot of inmates went outside.</br></br>

And they still had inmate workers going out there and doing slave labor and that’s how some people got infected with COVID by being forced to continue to work. But they’re just, there was such a lack of insight, such a lack of, of, of command. And every time any official like a lieutenant or a captain came in, or a sergeant, came in to speak to us, it was just all lies.</br></br>

They just needed, they needed, they’re well aware that we’ve had SARS breakout and we’ve had MRSA breakout and everything in prison. But the policies and procedures that are in place and the people that are left to manage these situations have just no clue on how to provide, they weren’t providing proper, I would’ve provided better cleaning materials.</br></br>

We know that bleach kills it. Instead, they use these PI materials that are bought and paid for by the tax and it may fight against COVID, and that’s the only chemicals that they were allowing us. But it was very limited and sparse and few in between that they weren’t giving us enough to clean the four, five times a day I would’ve.</br></br>

I would implement more cleaning procedures. The air vent that we breathe is just, if somebody was to come look and there’s two, three, four inches of dust in the environments that we’re forced to live in. And it’s just, there’s no wonder.</br></br>

I fear for the next breakout or something because a lot more people could, hundreds, probably about 250… I don’t know what the count is on prisoners but I know it’s up around 200, is just incomprehensible.</br></br>

That we were subjected to the environments that we were subjected to and not giving the social distancing space and then the moving around. I wouldn’t have done any of the moving around that they did in the crisis because the moving around, it seemed like it got people more sick, more, more agitated, more frustrated, more…</br></br>

And just better cleaning. They’re falsifying logs up there that they go through and clean five times a day, the phones weren’t being wiped down at all. And it’s like, there needs to be more oversight in situations like that to protect…</br></br>

You know, even though we’re inmates and we’re sentenced to life, we’re not sentenced, a lot of us weren’t sentenced to death sentences like those 200 inmates were. There was so much more that could’ve been done to negate and stop the spread of COVID.</br></br>

And Avenal State Prison was the worst of them all and it’s just by their policies and procedures and their lack of cleaning policies and procedures and the lack of giving us the proper cleaning tools and PPE and all that stuff. It’s just ridiculous up there. You know, you got an infected building and they were coming out and they were hugging dudes that were waiting to go to work and then those dudes came back to all the other buildings.</br></br>

You know, you had ten or 12 cats and then you had an infected building going into a chow hall where a noninfected building ate right in a chow hall that infected people ate in. If people understood the overtime that the correctional staff made. And you would look down the line and they’d be serving our trays, they wouldn’t [unintelligible] because they got to go home and take care of themselves.</br></br>

I didn’t get to finish that but as far as the reason I believe so many inmates were affected was, the correctional staff got to go home and take medicines. Us inmates were given aspirin, like here take some aspirin if you’re sick. Unless you were basically dying and couldn’t breathe, then you went and got special help.</br></br>

If the general public knew even how they handled the people that were suffering from mental illness and stuff like that, it was just pathetically sad and very, just unfathomable at how people and the inmates were treated during this pandemic inside prisons. My heart goes out to those families that had to, you know they literally charge their families to pay for the bodies and the families couldn’t even afford that in some cases, you know?</br></br>

It was just, and then the people, like I said, the three people I knew that died were all three really good people. They were getting out, they didn’t deserve to die in prison that’s for sure, that way.</br></br>

UCI: Damn, yeah that’s very hard to hear and very unfortunate that things went down that way.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, I just wish there was some more oversight and somebody who, like the CDC or somebody, they had no plan or no procedures. The inmates see, when they would try to push them on plans and procedures, they would just get lied to.</br></br>

And they kept notes and they asked them, “Why aren’t you guys wearing a mask? There’s a big breakout.” “Oh, we’ll deal with it when it hits.” And then it hits, and then, I think nine inmates, seven to nine died at Avenal State Prison and it was just too many. I bet you maybe one to two COs or free staff died.</br></br>

And that’s just, like I said, because they got to go home, socially distance, and take proper medicine to heal themselves and get better. We were just crammed into a, we were crammed into a small, confined area, sick with sick people just gets people sicker.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah. Apart from that, is there anything else that you think would be very helpful for people on the outside to know?</br></br>

Caller: Man, just that, you know, we’re not all child molesters, rapists, and murderers here in prison. There’s a lot of people, like myself, who’ve been down for 21 years and have got a proven record of rehabilitation and stuff.</br></br>

By the grace of God here, I just got sentenced, ten years off, and I go back on the [redacted] of next month and hopefully maybe they’ll take the life sentence off. You know, that just because we’ve committed crimes, we’re not all just horrible people in here.</br></br>

Sometimes, I think that the media portrays us as all child molesters, rapists, and murderers and we’re not all child molesters, rapists, and murderers. We’re human beings that made a mistake. We didn’t make a mistake that should deprive us of having a clean environment to live in or be treated like, basically felt like we been treated like animals during the whole pandemic basically.</br></br>

And it’s sad that people don’t see that a majority of people are coming out of prison anyways. And I sometimes think about how people are treated like worse than animals, how do you expect them to be treated when they get out on the outside?</br></br>

They control them here, but when they don’t have any control out there, maybe situations come back. And I think it makes for a more dangerous society for our families and loved ones, that they actually create people and so much hate and animosity by the way that we’re treated inside here, especially when it came to the pandemic and all that.</br></br>

Getting COVID and the lack of information and the unsanitary conditions and being forced to move and just the treatments. I was one of the most outspoken person. I filed three grievances and it’s basically CDCR just said, “We’re doing the best we can.”</br></br>

Well, I think they could’ve done a lot better, CDCR, as far as… And I think just the experience of coming here to LA and being made to sit in a paper suit, freezing, freezing cold teeth chattering, begging for help, and they just said, “We’re not equipped to handle this, you need to file a complaint.”</br></br>

And I still haven’t been filed a complaint. Quite truthfully I’m scared to file a complaint because the people who do file complaints, you know, bad things happen to them. But it’s a lot better than it was when I came here 21 years ago.</br></br>

But at the same time, I don’t think that any, if anybody was to come and look at the process that an inmate has to go through, coming into LA County, where you’re made to stay in a paper suit for two days in freezing cold conditions until you get medically evaluated and your COVID test, that’s just not a proper way to treat somebody.</br></br>

They could give them a blanket or something, a hot meal or something, but literally for three days, I didn’t see nothing. And, you know, I just, by the grace of God hopefully, I get a chance to, to be able to breathe the air of freedom and do right and honorable things like I will do if I'm given that chance.</br></br>

UCI: Alright, you mentioned the aspect of getting hot meals. How has that been like, as well, at your prison?</br></br>

Caller: Oh yeah, that’s a whole other thing. When I was in prison in the pandemic, they were serving us basically two cold meals. And usually, we’re used to two hot meals, and two cold meals and one hot meal a day.</br></br>

It was just, there were days, I couldn’t believe they would call the two meals that they would serve, meals. It was ridiculous. A couple slices of bread someday and a milk. It looked like we were, it was bad. But it got a little better.</br></br>

And then, for the longest time though, for months and months, we were just getting one hot meal at a time, a day, excuse me, not at a time. And it’s here, LA County it’s the same thing. They just serve one hot meal a day.</br></br>

Again, I just don’t, I don’t know how anybody… I look at it how I survive it but I don’t know how anybody survives these conditions. And they don’t understand that when you treat people they way you treat them, especially a lot who are gonna come out, it’s almost like, I always attribute it to they’re creating monsters basically because no human should have to live like, and eat some of the food they serve. It’s ridiculous.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah. One more question. How did you hear, hear about the, the project?</br></br>

Caller: I heard about you guys in the Prison Legal News.</br></br>

UCI: Okay.</br></br>

Caller: And also, in the Posse newsletter.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah. If you have, do you have any questions? Regarding our project or anything like that, do you have questions of your own?</br></br>

Caller: Before I left, I was planning on sending you guys, like, my 602s. And if I get back upstate or if I get released, I will probably definitely send them to you so you guys can definitely maybe post the responses from CDCR officials from a lot of these serious things that I said that I felt and actually was compelled, felt necessary to complain about and the responses.</br></br>

It’s just mind-blowing. The denial, the delays, the disregard for the complaint and the seriousness of the allegations that I made was just to me, it was mind-blowing, you know?</br></br>

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: And I hope to someday share that with you guys so that you guys can see the responses that are just, it’s just unbelievable. It’s mind-blowing that they would just dismiss the complaints and the things as they have, and the uniform that they answer them with. No regard for human life or the safety of people in these in these confined, enclosed, and cramped environments.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah. Let’s see. You could always, because we’re also open to mail, if you would like to write to us as well.</br></br>

Caller: Right.</br></br>

UCI: I don’t know if you want the P.O. box if you have a pen or…</br></br>

Caller: No, I got the address, so like I said, I hope if I, even if I get released, I plan on sending you guys. I had it all ready but on a spur of the moment, they came and picked me up and brought me to court. And so far, it turned out pretty good. I got to see the ocean for the first time in 21 years and I’m real grateful and thankful for that, you know what I mean?</br></br>

UCI: Yeah of course. If you don’t have any more questions, for my part, I think you gave a really great response and I think this should definitely go up on the site. So, if you have, if you don’t have any more questions or anything like that, you’re free to go, or anything like that.</br></br>

But we really appreciate your call and we’re grateful for it and hopefully it changes people’s perspectives because our project is meant to spread awareness and let people know what people are experiencing.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah. Well, thank you guys for your guys’ time and input and trying to help. It makes a big difference and God bless y’all.</br></br>

UCI: God bless you. Bye.</br></br>

Caller: Alright, bye.
