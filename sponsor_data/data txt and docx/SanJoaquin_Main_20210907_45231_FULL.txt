This story was told by an incarcerated individual at the San Joaquin County Jail.</br></br>

UCI: Great. So the date is [redacted]. And then what facility are you at?</br></br>

Caller: Right now I'm in San Joaquin County Jail.</br></br>

UCI: Perfect. Okay. So tell me about your experience.</br></br>

Caller: Well, I kind of wrote it out, but if – if you'd rather, like, do it in a – in a discussion, it'd probably be better. I was – this is my second COVID quarantine, and I was in prison for the last [one], I was – and I just kind of wrote stories that – that kind of compared the differences, but I really am short of paper, so I just, like, did [an about on the end].</br></br>

UCI: Absolutely. We – yeah, we would love for you if you just want to share it with me and just kind of read off what you have or however you want to do it is absolutely fine with me.</br></br>

Caller: So I was in – in the [unintelligible] institution, the other institution.</br></br>

UCI: That's fine, yeah.</br></br>

Caller: I was in – I was in Susanville [unintelligible] which is up in – it's in Susanville, but I was actually in Fire Camp, so I was – it was, like, a minimum security [unintelligible] doing all that, and then COVID hit and it put us on quarantine lockdown. And it – and it was touch and go at first because we – we were doing road work, like we were out doing fuel breaks and stuff out in the community, and we had it – like, our – we – we were based out of Antelope Camp, which is on the prison grounds, so as far as all the camps went, they were – like, we were out working, we were out in the community. We, like, it didn't even affect us because we were just out in the woods and – and we were, you know, cutting down trees and – and doing fuel breaks and stuff prior to the fire season, but then the guards brought it in and it – they – once one person got sick, it put us all on quarantine.</br></br>

And then they – it was – like, we lost 12 people – every time since we were on the prison grounds, which is, like, all the other camps are, like, off way out in the middle of nowhere, but since we were on the prison grounds and the prison was on quarantine, every positive test was rolled up and then moved back into the facility, and they started doing emergency releases, and there was people that had up to – man, I saw one guy that had 14 months left, he – he just – they just called him into the office and were, like, hey, can you get a ride tomorrow? Like, the first guy was, like, they were – they called five guys and they were, like, look, if you guys can get a ride out of here by Tuesday, you get to go home. And they were, like, all dumbfounded. They didn't know what to do.</br></br>

So they started making calls and then they started working even though, like, where, oh, I can jump in with this guy and he's going to the same, you know, he's going by that area where I live, so he'll just drop me off and, like, they – it was just, like, emergent, like, it was frantic. These guys were tripping. You know, nobody believed they were really going to get out. And then at the last minute they COVID tested them all, and one of them got cancelled because he had COVID by the time his release date came up. So he had plane tickets and he had – he had all kind of stuff going on. His people had come up all the way from – from San Bernardino. They flew up, took – took off the time from work. It was his sister and his mom had took the time off of work, flew all the way up to Susanville, rented a car, went and rented a motel, and stayed in the motel for, like, it was, like, three or five days by the – by the time they finally decided that they were going to go back. So they spent, like, a – a significant amount of money trying to get, you know, their, you know, their son and husband home or son and brother home. And then finally they told them, oh, yeah, well, we can't let them out until after he, you know, because they weren't releasing people that actually had the virus.</br></br>

And then they coursed through the, like, man, we went down. We had a population of 100 and, like, 20 people in the camp, and within 45 days we were down to about 22 people. And we had – we – we had a, you know, a decent program. You know, they moved TVs into our dorms. And luckily, our bunks were – our bunks were six feet apart, but they were in – they were individual bunks with little partitions between them, so we kind of got by. Well, they – I don't know about getting by, but we ended up not having to do a whole lot of movement, but because they kept thinning up the population because every – it was, like, 12 people with it, and then 19, and then 20, and we had a group of individuals that tried to ace the test by snorting anti-bacterial soap? Like, they chopped up anti-bacterial soap and snorted it in the nostril that they kept testing us in. And then they rolled up, like, 30 guys on that one just because there were so many inconclusive tests. Like, you know, you know, sometimes people in the inmate population aren't that bright, but, so, they did that.</br></br>

And then that – we got down to there was about 20 of us or 22 of us in the camp, and, I mean, like we were – like, the food, like, there was just huge amounts of food that were going to waste because there's nobody to eat it, but they had, you know, because all the food was brought in, like, on a monthly plan. And, so, like, they made all the food as if it was a regular thing, and we were – and, like, there was big fires. Like, it was a horrible season because, like, it was in the middle of fire season, we're supposed to be out there fighting fires, and all of the – all of the camps were on quarantine and they couldn't go out. And then at the – at the very end, like, I was – I was about two weeks out from – from actually getting released myself on my regular out date, but everybody keeps coming up and getting these – these weird spur of the moment releases.</br></br>

And then they come in and they just told us all to pack up our stuff and – and go to – we had to go back to the facility because there was so many people in the facility from our camp that all had positive tests and they were past their quarantine time, so they just rolled all of us up that didn't have – that never contacted – contracted the virus, they sent us in and put us on a yard that was full of – of people that had the virus, but there was just our two dorms that were not allowed to nothing – no phones, no – no library, no laundry services, no anything. Nothing like that whereas we were, you know, it – and then the only way we would have been able to go back to camp was if we contacted the virus and, like, there were people doing weird stuff like going out and, you know, just they – they were trying to contact the virus however they could. They were maximizing the surface areas that they were touching, you know, they were – they were doing weird stuff. Like, I don't know. I'm not going to really put that out there.</br></br>

But it was – it was an experience because you got to remember, you're going from being out and having basically complete freedom, you know, where you can walk out the door and you can, you know, we – we could go out in the woods or we could do whatever to – to being back on a secure yard and, you know, watching everybody else just get regular program. But I ended up getting released off that. I ended up getting released, like, on quarantine. And when I left, they had – like, there was no – it was 45 days in and there was no – there wasn't yard – like, any type of yard service or anything like that. You couldn't go out. There's no church. There's no, like, the no library, no store, no none of that stuff. It was just you're just locked in a room and, like, you know, there's no, like, social distance. I don't know. Like, you know, I don't think you guys have probably ever been locked up, but there's no social distance in jail or in prison. There's no, you know, I need this six feet of space. It's all about the – in – in, like, [unintelligible] right now when I go into the store [unintelligible] I'm currently on quarantine in the county jail, and my court date is tomorrow, and everybody else's courts date have come and gone and, like, nobody gets to go to court. Due process is just non-existent.</br></br>

Here they – they had the – so our food comes from a – the honor farm. They – they, you know, basically it – [unintelligible] vendors, so our food comes in in, like, a, you know, a little box basically or little tray, and it's, you know, like a scoop of beans and a scoop of rice and, you know, they have a cold tray with a little scoop of salad and some bread or something like that. And for breakfast usually it's always either oat – it's basically always oatmeal. But, so, the honor farm, which is the – responsible for sending the food over to this area had – it – it contacted the virus first, and they went on lockdown, so we've been getting basically peanut butter sandwiches for a month – a month and a half now, almost two months just peanut butter sandwiches, and – and an apple; you know? Like, I laugh, but it's not really funny. Then we get one hot meal a day, and it's usually beans or – or beans and potatoes is, like, the biggest – the biggest thing. Like, every – every third day you'll get like a – a soy product or something to resemble meat.</br></br>

But they – so we have – this kind of jail runs a little different. When you're in the – in the pod area, it – you have your own cell and there's no bathroom. Like, the bathroom is outside. You know, mostly when you see, like, jails and stuff like that, pictures of jail cells or prison cells or something, there's usually a bathroom in it. Well, this one doesn't – doesn't have it. The door doesn't lock. You're allowed to go outside of your cell. During normal program, we have, you know, a little handball court outside. There's eight TVs or six TVs or something like that. And, you know, a dayroom area where you can go out there and play games. And the only time during the day that you're locked down is from 4: 00 to 6: 00. So, like, but there's no cleaning supplies. There's the, you know, you get at 3: 00 in the morning or 3: 30 in the morning when we have breakfast they have – they put out cleaning supplies for the people that have to do their chores, and there's just one type of cleaner, and it's, like, a super watered-down disinfectant. And they have this other stuff that they put out that the people here, they really think that it's, like, the best stuff going because it smells good, but it's glass cleaner, and they think that that's what they need to use to clean all their services because it makes their room smell good. But not to get off topic, I'm sorry.</br></br>

But they just don't – like, the cleaning supplies and everything are – are inadequate for the amount of men that are being housed. And then you have also, you have a, like, 3: 30 you have another cleanup in the afternoon. But all those supplies are for the bathrooms and the showers and the outside. Like, you don't ever get anything. There's not somebody that cleans door knobs, there's not somebody that – and the people that are doing the chores here, like, the people, like, let's say the guy that has [unintelligible], for instance, you know, he's – he's a 22 or 23-year old individual that's never had a job in his life, has only done drugs or been in a gang or anything like that, and they don't really, like, know how to clean. So, you know, things don't get taken care of they way they should, so when it came – they ended up double bunking us. So like I said, we're in – we're in rooms with a bed and a desk and that's it. A door, you know? It's about a – I don't know – about a 12 by 7 maybe, and – and they had overcrowding in the intake part, which is actually like a jail cell, and they came in and they threw a bunch of mattresses in a pile by the door, and they moved in 16 more guys.</br></br>

And, so, 16 rooms got additional, you know, bunks on the ground. So now you had instead of just 66 people, we had – what's that – 82? And it's three of the individuals for sure that – that came in on this – on this little emergency, you know, bunking situation, like, were – were – they looked dead to the world. Like, they were just laid on the floor. They never moved. They were just, you know, complained about headaches. And then some people talked to them. They're, like, well, how long, you know, what's up? How long you been here? And it turns out that they had been here less than a week and they didn't even go through a quarantine process, and they were in here living on the floors. And we're all using the same sinks, the same showers, the same bathrooms, and, you know, next thing you know, couple guys are talking about they got headaches. And then it just – so we've been on quarantine now for I think we're going into our fifth week, sixth week, and – but we all – we – we've passed two of the – two of the tests, so we got two of them all negatives.</br></br>

They – but they finally came up with a situation where they put all of the individuals that the first time through they took everybody – there was, like, 19 people that had it, and – or tested positive anyway, and they took all of those people and they moved them back to intake. And then it thinned out the population enough to where, you know, we – we should have got a hold on it, but because our – our bathrooms and our showers and stuff, like I said, are – are outside of the cell, there's a lot of movement and you have a lot of people that are, like, going in other rooms and hanging out and talking, and they're – so they're contracting the virus that way, you know, because they're, like, oh, yeah, well, he doesn't look sick, and this guy doesn't look sick.</br></br>

When I contracted it, I – I just woke up one night in the middle of the night and I had a headache, and it was a – it was a decent headache, and then the next day I noticed that my legs, my muscles were kind of sore. And I didn't – I didn't really think nothing of it, though, because I – I had worked out legs really – really, you know, hard the day before, so, you know, my – my legs were supposed to be sore as it was, but then the next day my legs were sore, I kind of, like, I thought, you know, I should probably take a look at that. So I put in a – a little request on a – on the machine downstairs. I went and notified medical that I had, you know, headaches and sore muscles and thought nothing of it; you know what I mean? And everything was good. I didn't have no problems after that. Just went away. And I was thinking, okay, well, maybe I'm just, you know, I'm just being a hypochondriac or something and I'm just kind of worried myself into feeling that I was sick. And didn't [unintelligible] tested us, and I came back negative, and I felt – felt kind of confident that everything was going to be okay.</br></br>

And then the next test the next week, they came back to my cell after they had already cleared – after they had already came through and did all of the tests, they came back to my cell and notified me that my test had come back indecisive or inconclusive or something like that, and they – they took another one, and then they came back and they said, oh, well, you – you reported that you were having symptoms, so we're going to move you up with everybody else that has it. So I ended up moving up into a little area. By now they had figured out to put – because we were all sharing the same sink and the same showers, and nobody goes and washes their hands, like, at, you know, you're – all the doorknobs and all the faucets and everything is where it was being passed, obviously, because we weren't getting a chance to clean them, and, you know, you don't – it was just you don't think about some of the stuff that you're touching, obviously.</br></br>

And, you know, really, like, we had one guy that said that – one guy looked really bad. He was – he was, like, sweating, and he had told a couple of his friends, he was an African American [unintelligible] that – that he couldn't smell anything, and he was going to go and – and this is in the very beginning when – when it first started coming in. He said he was going to go and notify the, you know, the deputies that – that he had – that he was sick, and his buddy told him, no, no, no, don't do that. He goes, yeah, I can't smell and I'm sick and this and that, and he goes, no. And he [unintelligible] and he came back with peppers and – and Flamin' Hot Cheetos with chili sauce on it and told him, here, take this and it will clear you up. I know – I know home remedies. And, so, because he didn't want his friend to go back to intake or to be removed from the – the building he was in, he jeopardized all our health and – and didn't let the guy go through the – through the process of, you know, being around – and it's – like, it's something that, like, I – I didn't really realize how, like, discourteous we are to each other until, you know, this – until, you know, the – this thing came through here.</br></br>

Like, I was going to write my dad a letter, and he has the – he has the vaccine and stuff, but I was going to write my dad a letter and I was thinking, you know, that would be awful messed up if I sent him that letter and he picked up the virus from getting it here in jail. So, you know, I haven't been able to contact him, you know, I haven't been able to do none of the regular stuff. So it's been really hard, really difficult. And – but I don't know. It's, like, they just tested our second test today, and we should be getting off here by Friday off of quarantine, but I don't know. It's really made me take a look at – at, you know, how we're all, you know, taking this thing. Like, it – like I thought – I didn't think it was anything real. I thought it was a media hoax, and I thought that there was just a bunch of BS that was going on with it and I didn't take it seriously. I still kind of think it's, you know, a little trumped up, but at the same time, like, it is something that – it – it is real, it does exist, and it's, you know, it is taking an impact.</br></br>

I do feel kind of foolish, you know, running around hiding from a common cold, but at the same time, like, you know, there's – they got – we got an older guy in here, he's – I'd say he's – I don't know – maybe – probably around 70 or so, little Chinese guy, and it just – it put him on his back. He's been on his bed, like, man, since the very beginning. He was probably one of the first ones to catch it and I – we've been really kind of worried about him. But we did get some – some pointers from the nurse saying that, you know, when you get it, you just got to stay active, she showed up some breathing examples. Not – not us as everybody in the whole, but just the people that were interested and were asking questions. She told us to do some breathing exercises like you're trying to drink a – a milkshake, and that one kind of hit me hard because I really like milkshakes, but, so, other than that, I think we're almost through.</br></br>

I thank you guys for listening to me. I hope that you guys do get enough documentation and enough of those stories to – to really do something with the opportunity to share.</br></br>

UCI: Absolutely. Thank you so much. That was great. And if anything changes, feel free to call us back. And if anyone else has a story to share, feel free to share information. Thank you so much.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah. I – I actually wrote a couple poems earlier if you're the ones that answers Adam's calls [unintelligible] I have another person in here that called, and I – I wrote some stuff under [unintelligible] that he sent in. I don't know if that does any – that helps at all, but I – I'm probably going to – just because I need to start doing something, I'm going to start – I'm going to start writing and – and doing stuff. If I get – if I get something good enough, I'll send it over.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, we love – I know Adam, he – that he does, like, narratives, and we things of that nature that depict, you know, COVID-19, but also just what it's like to be incarcerated in general I think is really important, too. So anything of that nature. We also take artwork. So if somebody you know is an artist and they want to send in material, we love that kind of stuff, too. So we're really open to all forms of telling a story.</br></br>

Caller: Okay. And how long does this go for? Is this just for the pandemic or is it – </br></br>

UCI: That's a great question.</br></br>

Caller: Should I put your number in my [unintelligible]?</br></br>

UCI: That's a great question.</br></br>

Caller: Okay. Cool.</br></br>

UCI: I'm not – I'm not entirely sure right now. I mean, it's still very active as you know – as you just told me. So I assume for this foreseeable future we hope that this continues on and progresses more into other elements, too, but for right now I think it's here to stay for a little bit for sure.</br></br>

Caller: Okay. Yeah, I'll – I'll put the number in my – in my little book and – because we're – I mean, I'm anticipating at least – I don't know – a couple months in prison, so there's a lot more stuff available there. Here you're really limited on resources and, you know, like creativity is kind of, you know, kind of not very encouraged here; you know?</br></br>

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: They try to keep it kind of down, so, yeah, I'll – I'll definitely – there – there's a lot of great artists that come once I get over to that side, too, and I like the idea of being able to, you know, kind of put something in – into, you know, where people can study it. And if you – I mean, if it's not just COVID stuff, I – it would help, too, like, knowing that; you know?</br></br>

UCI: Yeah. A lot of our stories –</br></br>

Caller: Okay. Thank you.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, a lot of our stories do talk about the prison system, and I think that's important because you can't really differentiate between the two, so anything –</br></br>

Caller: Yeah.</br></br>

UCI: - of that nature of their story, anything we love. So always feel free to share our information with anyone.</br></br>

Caller:  Okay. Yeah. For sure. I'll do that.</br></br>

UCI:  Great. Have a great night.</br></br>

Caller: Thank you very much, [Erin].</br></br>\

UCI: Yeah. Absolutely. Have a great night.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, you, too.</br></br>

UCI: Thanks. Bye-bye.</br></br>

Caller: All right. Bye.</br></br>
