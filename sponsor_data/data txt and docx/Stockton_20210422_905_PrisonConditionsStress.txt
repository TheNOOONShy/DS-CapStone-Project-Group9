I am still a human being who experiences The many thoughts and emotions of a human due to this COVID-19 pandemic. This time of mine has now become very much mentally damaging. At first, not really knowing as to what COVID-19 really was, or how and when it might affect me. Or was it something designed to produce a distinctive or desired impression.</br></br>
It is now becoming very frustrating, confusing and filled with anger or even self-pity. Affected with or expressive of grief, or unhappiness. However, in my own particular situation, and this day forward, I am benefiting from it all.</br></br>
Unlike the many people out in the free public, who have never experienced a form of meditative state or act or process of meditation marked by a conductive silence. Then to be able to focus on one’s own thoughts or reflect on, or be able to ponder over to plan and project in one’s own mind.</br></br>
As to the many active mental qualities, or state of being mentally active, such as the vigorous or energetic actions that one’s own mental state holds or has to offer. Instead, their mental thoughts are nothing but what they are not capable of providing themselves to keep themselves active.</br></br>
Unlike the many people out in the free public, I am located in an underworld of few escapes. I am forced to see myself at face value and there is no running away from the truth. As time has wheeled it heavily on all of us, in this subframe Society.  Now, we have found ourselves facing a pandemic that does not even utter it’s threats against its many ills. That also gives no signs or warning of the seriousness that does hang dangerously and without announcing its intended or possible works or its many strikes of it’s deaths that awaits us all of the pandemic porten evils.
