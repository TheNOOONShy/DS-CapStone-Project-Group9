My experiences with COVID-19 at Sierra Conservation Center have been of high anxiety and high exposure, this facility’s procedures have caused almost 90 percent of its population to contract the virus. And I’ll tell you how, when COVID-19 was first detected at this facility it was contained with housing units isolated from others which resulted in self feeding to those isolated units. After our first phase of resolved cases a free staff kitchen worker came into the facility positive, therefore resulting the inmate kitchen workers to be exposed or have contracted the virus.<br><br>

Those inmates went to their housing units for at least two days before being tested for COVID-19 in the process spread the virus among none sick inmates. Then it became a live domino effect and here is what they did! An inmate was tested today and then two days later a positive test comes back, they move him to another housing with inmates. And the exposed inmates tested then moved into another housing unit (dorm) before rest results are back.<br><br> 

Moved into a housing unit with inmates who haven’t had a positive result or exposed to a positive inmate, that rapid and constant movement cased SCC to move to number one infection in CDCR during December 23rd to the 31st 2020. After all the bad moves CDCR made, SCC had 60 inmates that didn’t get COVID-19 and I am one of those inmates.<br><br>

But I feel others shouldn’t have even contracted the virus and wouldn't have if the CDCR here at SCC didn't move exposed inmates into housing units with healthy non exposed inmates, that just isn't right. But my small voice isn't loud enough to cause attention to the correct people to stop things like this, were inmate true, but we are also human beings as well. SCC got its inmates sick with unnecessary movements, lack of staff testing, and lack of cleanliness.<br><br> 

This place is a mess especially the living quarters, I have only filed a complaint with the inspector general to try and get this place to move its feet on getting this place up to code.
