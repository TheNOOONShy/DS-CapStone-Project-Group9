This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Mule Creek.</br></br>

I am not a victim, a victim is a choice. I choose to not allow my environment to dictate who I am. I killed someone in 1998 and I deserve everything that happens to me.</br></br> 

That is my karma, and I accept it, however it makes me sad to see that the people who are supposed to help criminals change their lives are actually worse that the criminals.</br></br>

Nietzsche said "Be careful when fighting monsters, you might become one yourself," and that's what happens a lot of the time. COs assimilate to us. They talk, walk, and act like us.</br></br>

California prisons are a special case because gangs control them, and they end up deciding how we react to the pandemic. If an old man says be violent, we are violent. If the old man says stay down, we stay down.</br></br>

The mafia dictates our behavior. Then you have SNY yards, they don't know what to do. Most criminals are followers and they want to be told how to feel, when they don't have that they are on robot mode.</br></br>

They don't feel. The saddest thing is this about the pandemic and criminals in general. We have very little education. A lot of us are okay being dumb.</br></br>

We watch Jerry Springer and laugh. We eat, we drink, we do drugs, and we are happy. I am sorry to say this but 80 percent of people here fall into that category, and that can be fixed. But society prefers us like that, that way they have someone to point their fingers at.</br></br>

The politicians, the priest, the crooked person. They need the criminal to exist and this pandemic didn't change anything. They gave us the vaccine before the public. That was the worst thing they could have done.</br></br>

Now we can resume the drug use, and the PIA sweatshops can resume. The COs can go back to doing nothing. We can go back to the illusion of rehabilitation. How I wish this place would help the people in it.
