This letter was written by someone at California City.</br></br>


I’m sorry but my writing skills are very poor, last grade completed was 8th grade so I’m going to try to keep it short and simple. I’m currently serving a 10 year, four month sentence. My E.P.R.D. release date is 3/2027. I’m serving a six year base term plus enhancements, 16 months consecutive enhancement, two year bail enhancement and one year prison prior for a total of 10 years, four months at 85% for first degree burglary. I served one year in Kern County jail, and was released and put on probation for three years.</br></br>


I violated my probation 18 months after my release and now I have to serve the 10 year, 4 months of my joint suspension and it happened to be during the pandemic in county jail. We were getting only one hour a day to shower, make phone calls, and sit in the day room. The rest of the time we were locked in our cells all of our three meals; we had to eat inside our cells.</br></br>


All classes and programs remained closed. I spent 15 months in county jail. I wasn’t able to be transported to prison because of the COVID outbreak in prison until November 2020, when we arrived at prison Wasco Reception Center. We were put in cells, two inmates per cell for 14 days to quarantine. We only got 15 minutes once each week to shower and make a phone call. We had to bird bath in our cells every day.</br></br>


After the 14 days of quarantine were over, we were moved to a non quarantine cell block in two-man cells. There, we got one hour day room for showers, phone calls, and T.V. once a day with no programs available or jobs during Christmas.</br></br> 


I got infected with COVID. I was sick for two weeks -- chills, bodyache, headache, nausea, loss of appetite, and chest pain. I filled out two sick call slips and after 12 days, I got to see the doctor. They realized that I had tested positive a week earlier and that I should’ve been moved to a quarantine building. They gave me some pain meds, allergy, and nausea medicine and moved me that same day.</br></br>


After I recovered from the virus, I was moved to a dorm room. It was much better than being in a cell all day and night in the dorm. We were able to play Dominoes games and watch T.V. I was only there for a few days and then I had to pack to transfer to mainline California City Correctional.</br></br> 


It was the same here when we arrived. We were put in a two-man cell for 14 days to quarantine. After the 14 days, we were moved to a normal cell block, two-man cells. Four cells get to be out one hour a day room at a time for shower, phone, microwave, and T.V. The rest of the 23 hours were in our cells.</br></br>

They started to open up classrooms, limited seats and jobs but there’s a long waiting list and the youth offenders have priority first, so I’m still waiting for programs and a job, so things have been much more difficult. All the time I spent in county jail has made my time longer; if I would have been transferred to CDC a lot sooner, my 88% would have dropped to 80%.</br></br> 


And also, since there haven't been any jobs or programs to get milestones or my G.E.D. or vocational training, it feels like time is standing still and we’re not making any progress. I was able to complete the Matrix program, Moral Reconation therapy, Aggression Replacement training and Computer Keyboarding #1, and I was about to take my G.E.D. test in county jail right before the pandemic started.</br></br> 


I’ve been waiting since, hoping to pick up and continue with my G.E.D. and other self help programs and vocational training, not just to get milestones but to educate myself to better myself and my chances of being able to reenter society and have a better chance to succeed. And, it would also help for our days to go by much faster by staying busy and having something to look forward to every day like classes during the week and self help group meetings on the weekend and church services.</br></br> 


It would make our time much more easier and productive instead of being locked in our cells 23 hours a day. It’s like we’re being kept in storage when we should be getting rehabilitation. It’s like we are in segregated housing units where they put inmates when they get in trouble and they take away all your privileges. We just sit in our cells all day.</br></br>


I don’t think it’s good for us psychologically; maybe, if we at least had tablets during a time like this. While social distancing is an issue, tablets would help so we could watch educational videos, do N.A., anger management and other educational programs and stay in touch with family by video visits at a time like this, while we are worried about our families out there as they are about us because of the pandemic.</br></br>


They have already offered the vaccine and vaccinated all inmates that volunteered to get vaccinated. I refused the vaccine because I was already infected and recovered. I’d rather wait and see what the trials end up like and the side effects, but I would hope that with most of the inmates being vaccinated already that, hopefully soon, we will resume to normal programming.</br></br>


Thank you for your interest and for wanting to hear from us. We all and our families feel blessed and appreciate you.
