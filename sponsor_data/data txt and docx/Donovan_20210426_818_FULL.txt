This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Donovan.</br></br>

Dear PrisonPandemic,</br></br>

Hi how are you? I was overcome by creative inspiration because of you. After receiving your letter in the mail. And put this letter together as a response to you. I’m always open to receive, and keep the line of communication open to people out in the world.</br></br>

I’m a native of San Diego, California, born and raised. I was looking for an outlet, and you made that possible through God’s divine intervention. It’s good to know someone on the outs is as kind as you. You thinking about the wellbeing of me.</br></br>

This social distancing is cruel and unusual, especially when I’m already separated from my loved one as it is. I mean how much more do I need to be separated? I’m in the Otay part of San Diego. Just north of the border at Donovan State Prison. And I’m from the East county.</br></br>

My mother is 15-20 minutes away and I don’t have any access to her. If you could give her a word from me and tell her I miss her.</br></br>

Please. It’s imperative. She’s worried sick about me, we basically been inseparable, my whole life up until I was 20 and came to prison. We have never been apart this long. I don’t know where I’d be without my mother. She’s done everything for me, and I love her to death.</br></br>

Just an interesting fact, but out in the world, when a mother gives birth “animal,” the baby really can’t survive. Without the mother, because like I do, it depends on her. And when you take that away you're pretty much deprived. She’s all I communicate with, and they cut the line of communication.</br></br>

If you’ve been watching the news, a couple months ago, they were protesting in the part of town where I was born and raised, and brought up. In the city of La Mesa which is in the East County. They had a riot, that was sparked by the assault of a Black male, by police officer, which later surfaced on the news, and created an uproar in my town.</br></br>

Caging a stand off with thousands rushing the La Mesa police department/precinct. Later sending escalating mobs into the streets of La Mesa setting fires to different buildings, vandalizing property, looting, and setting fires.</br></br>

My dearest mother’s name is [redacted]. She stays right around that area. It caught my attention because it was interesting to see that, with all that’s been going on. I try to pay attention to the different effects, and the toll it takes during those times and how we react and adjust to the different changes in our community.</br></br> 

And what I seen, and what I can say from that, is a whole lot has changed.</br></br>

But being in prison has taught me how to be humble and to humble myself, and concentrate on being a better person. With that comes self improvement and soul searching given that chance, instead of the negative. Because if you let the negative rule your life, is this working for me? That’s what you ask yourself.</br></br> 

Are you in control, of yourself and everything around you, or are you out of control because you’re living in chaos.</br></br>

So everyday is a struggle. A battle, what are we fighting for? Could be something we want, could be an image, some type of goal. What are we willing to do? To reach that goal. Use different strategies and coping skills.</br></br>

Number one: first and foremost, and instead of the negative, we’re going to hack it with positive reinforcement. That’s what I use, and work with everyday. To be humble, find some type of peace. Much love to you, may God bless you and your loved ones.</br></br>

Sincerely.
