This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Mule Creek.</br></br>IÕd noticed that custody staff were more and more often powerless to govern day to day matters involving prisoners. Accountability for the ensuing year of chaos resorted to custody staff blaming the medical department while the medical department staff act stupid and claim that all the arbitrary program changes were initiated by Sacramento bureaucrats.</br></br>All the while this chaos frustrated everyone, except the Suboxone patients enjoying their free highs without the inconvenience of work assignments or CBT rehab programs to bother with. I was amongst many at the maximum security facility who were transferred to a medium security facility in order to make room for a quarantine unit per Sacramento bureaucrats orders.</br></br>This transfer seemed to have been perceived as a threat and prompted custody staff at receiving facilities to harass the new arrivals and place them in compromising situations housing them with incompatible cellmates who resented integrating with higher custody prisoners. There were also situations where a number of prisoners were housed in the gym, previously ruled unconstitutional (see Plata v. Coleman v. Schwarzenegger etc.).</br></br>Where rising tensions in an already frustrating year resulted in a number of assaults and one suicide that I know of here. As mentioned earlier, custody staff and medical staff alike were hostile and unsympathetic to all these inconveniences.</br></br>Consequently, the number of Rule Violation Reports (RVRÕs) increased exponentially, along with corresponding staff assaults, cell-fights, cell murders, suicide attempts, etc. It would be interesting to discover the statistics regarding staff assaults, cell fights murder suicides etc. for a three-year period preceding COVID compared to those recorded in 2020-2021.</br></br>
