Well to be honest you’re probably more safe in prison with this COVID-19 virus flying around us in the air. But on the other hand it’s sometimes you’re likely to get it.</br></br>  

In a six by nine inch cell because of the six feet social distancing. So it’s damn if you’re on the street and damn if you’re in a prison cell. So it could be scary. Who wants to be in prison for so many years and die in prison and never get out to the real world.</br></br> 

It could be scary and an awful thought to never see the streets or your loved ones again. Especially your children and grandchildren. It could be a very hard pill to swallow but basically anyone can die from anything.</br></br>

Well for me, I haven’t had any visits in five years. It’s not because they don’t love me. It’s because my family is very busy. But we went from visits to no visits due to the COVID-19 pandemic. So I could just imagine how wonderful it could be to have visits.</br></br> 

And then no visits, it could be very depressing. And the inmates not only look forward to seeing family, and loved ones, or friends. They also look forward to the better food they can buy in the visiting room ‘cause they have vending machines so their families can purchase.</br></br> 

So that’s special. The food here sucks.
