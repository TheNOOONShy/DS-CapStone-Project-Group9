This story was told by a person incarcerated at Mule Creek.</br></br>

Caller: You know, come to the store. Trying to get things coming that we supposed to have. Basically, it was actually harder during the pandemic, I could say. And yeah, but, you know, I'm just trying to hang in and just stay positive as I'm in here.</br></br>

I just want to see it, you know, get better overall for everybody, you know. Everybody and they families, and hoping that this is just over with. I know they opened up a little bit, so I see when I watch TV, these people going to concerts and things like that.</br></br>

But I heard about another outbreak in LA I'm not sure if it's, you know, true or not. But, I just pray that my family's safe I could say. And it has been quite an experience being in prison, though.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, the pandemic has definitely done a lot of damage. I agree. How has the vaccination situation been like at your facility?</br></br>

Caller: I actually got vaccinated. A lot of people have been vaccinated, both of them. You know, a couple of them refused. Like the COs, they don't want to take the vaccination or whatever. But you can't force nobody to do something like that. But I feel everybody would be safer if everybody would just comply with the rules that are set, I would say, you know?</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, I do agree with you.</br></br>

Caller: So yeah that's - hello?</br></br>

UCI: Hi, I'm here, I'm here.</br></br>

Caller: [unintelligible] A little hard [unintelligible] I do think [unintelligible] and get it. [unintelligible] is like that.</br></br>

UCI: In trouble? What do you mean by in trouble?</br></br>

Caller: Just like, you know, situation [unintelligible] mental breakdowns and things like that, you know? Just trying to just stay out of the way and just make sure I'm able just to get home. I got a couple more years until I'm released.</br></br> 

So, I just try to stay on the right path as I could say, but during the pandemic it makes it a little bit hard, you know? Or like certain things that we can't do that we used to be able to do and that makes time easier. As in getting into groups and I could say like the yard programs, and things like that, you know. It's to a limit, I could say.</br></br>

Especially like when the pandemic was really in the prisons, it was pretty hard. We wasn't going outside like that. And it's stressful. [unintelligible] situation. Now we can, you know? Fighting our cases and things like that and just trying to get out of prison. So, it's hard.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, I understand completely. The pandemic has really done a number on a lot of things. You mentioned that you have programs that are at a limit? What have the limitations been like?</br></br>

Caller: Just like [unintelligible]. But when the pandemic was hitting, it was no movement to groups. It was barely people going to their jobs that you know the prison provides. And you just basically sat in the cell and things like that. That's what I could basically say about that, you know.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah. How have you been coping with the crisis?</br></br>

Caller: Me, I basically just work out, exercise, you know? Just to keep my spirit in. Read books and things like that. Really the main thing that helps me get through is me writing my music and trying to stay on the right path. So, when I get out of prison, I can be something in life, I could say, you know. Hopefully, my music career can take off and I can achieve the goals that I'm willing to perceive.</br></br>

UCI: That is amazing to hear. That's wonderful. Keep that up. It's just a little bit longer.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah. Because I'm an artist basically right now. I don't want to come back to jail, so I'm having to find something that I'm interested in doing, and just run with it basically, you know? Of course, I might have like a side job and all that. But there's no telling. You know, TikTok and these Instagrams and all that, want to just make it to where I want to be. I just keep faith and, you know, never give up on my dream, I could say.</br></br>

UCI: That is beautiful to hear. That is so great. I'm very happy for you.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, I appreciate it.</br></br>

UCI: Is there anything else you want people to know about your experience?</br></br>

Caller: That's pretty much everything I could really think of. That's like the main, you know, objective I could say. But other than that, I could say it's getting a little better. I just hope that COVID could just stay down to a low minimum, I could say that.</br></br> 

It don't come back the way it was and everybody, we locked in our cells again, a lot. And we got to keep getting scanned, like you know, to see if we got fevers and things like that. Or you know, just things that you got to do during the COVID. Keeping getting COVID tests. Putting a swab in our nose, it was just every week. It just, you know, got tiring after a while.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, I'm with you on that one. And what do you think would have made the situation at your facility better?</br></br>

Caller: What can make it better? Or may have been better?</br></br>

UCI: What would have made the situation better?</br></br>

Caller: I don't know. I could say them giving us second tests I could say. Like I know in certain situations like if somebody tests positive for COVID, or it's just like a, how can I explain it, like a test, but you're not really negative, but it's just like the test was like messed up, they won't give you a second test. They'll just send you down, you know, straight to quarantine.</br></br>

And I know certain people who didn't have COVID, and they're like, "Why can't I get another test?" The test was just, you know, a fraud test, basically. But they didn't want to hear that. I said they was trying to do it like some tax fraud type thing or something like that. You know, how does it pay and all that?</br></br>

So, that gets them paid. So, I felt they weren't caring about inmates at the time. They just basically doing what they want to help them get paid is how I felt.</br></br>

UCI: I see, I see. So, do you think your facility wasn't paying enough attention to you guys?</br></br>

Caller: No, not to a certain extent. Like I know a couple of people were refusing and things like that. Like and they would quarantine the whole cell. But these dudes protested and basically said like, "We ain't got COVID. Ain't nobody in here was sick, throwing up or nothing like that. And they're trying to force us to move, basically," is what the argument was, I know.</br></br>

And we weren't able to come up and go to yard and things like that, unless they was forced to take COVID tests and things like that. So, yeah, it's been quite an experience in jail with the COVID.</br></br>

UCI: That sounds awful. Is there anything else you want to share?</br></br>

Caller: Not necessarily. No.</br></br>

UCI: Do you have any other questions? About the program or ... ?</br></br>

Caller: If you would like [unintelligible].</br></br>

UCI: I'm sorry, what did you say?</br></br>

Caller: I said, if you don't mind [unintelligible].</br></br>

UCI: Hello? Are you still with me?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah. I said I don't mind. When they tell me about it, basically.</br></br>

UCI: Oh, okay. So, we are -</br></br> 

Caller: About the program.</br></br>

UCI: So, we decided to create this project to archive and capture the stories and experiences of people who are incarcerated. So, we are on a mission just to get your voices out there. We want to hear your stories. We want to hear your voices. We understand what's happening with you guys. And we want the public to know about it.</br></br>

Caller: Okay. Something that I had a question about, [unintelligible] if you can actually tell me about, but it was something they were supposed to do with us basically, like how could I explain it? It's like my percentage is 85 percent, you know, so I'm in jail for robbery, basically. I made some poor decisions.</br></br> 

But we're supposed to be knocked down to like 60th percent and things like that. Like I can't really explain it, but I know we were supposed to get to where our sentences get cut a little bit. Have you heard anything about that?</br></br>

UCI: I'm sorry, I have not heard anything about that.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, I don't know the exact words [unintelligible]. Yeah, I was trying to ask somebody about it. They don't know. Yeah, like a sentence reduction.</br></br>

UCI: Has your sentence reduction been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic?</br></br>

Caller: Not lately [unintelligible] pretty much during the pandemic it was pretty hit. But not [unintelligible]. They supposed to take off some more [unintelligible] but they talking about [unintelligible] streets. Hello?</br></br>

UCI: I'm here. I understand. Thank you, though.</br></br>

Caller: Mm, hmm. Yeah.</br></br>

UCI: Are there any last experiences? Or what are your thoughts on the pandemic?</br></br>

Caller: Oh, shoot. I hope to get out.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, me too.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, but it was nice talking to you.</br></br>

UCI: Thank you, thank you very much for calling. And thank you very much for participating in PrisonPandemic.</br></br>

Caller: All right. Thank you.</br></br>

UCI: Please consider telling your friends about us, and seeing if they want to call in, too. But I really appreciate your call.</br></br>

Caller: All right. Bye.</br></br>

UCI: Thank you. Goodbye.
