In the month of January I caught COVID-19. Not only did I catch it but every man in the sector got sick. I was so sick I couldn’t breathe. It was scary.</br></br> 

In the middle of the night I pushed the emergency button in my cell. Immediately a deputy came over the intercom and asked “What is your medical emergency?” “I can’t breathe.” I pleaded.</br></br> 

The deputy popped my door open and I weakly made my way down the stairs to sit in the day room. The nurse took my pulse oxy and seen it was only at 81 percent. They hooked me to oxygen and called 911. Twenty minutes later I was in UCI Medical.</br></br>

I was terrified. This was my first time in a hospital. I was an inmate and alone. But UCI Medical made me feel at ease.</br></br> 

They took good care of me. I was given antiviral medication, steroids, oxygen, and a lot of love. The medical staff were so brave. I tear up as I write this, thinking of their bravery.</br></br> 

The food was good. After eating nothing but cold sandwiches for several months at the jail, it was wonderful to eat three hot meals a day for the six days I spent in the hospital.
