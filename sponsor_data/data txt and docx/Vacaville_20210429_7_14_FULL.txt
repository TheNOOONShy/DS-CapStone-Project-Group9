This story was told by a person incarcerated at Vacaville.</br></br>

UCI: We’re just asking for, I mean, whatever you guys want to tell us, your experience with COVID and—</br></br>

Caller: Like how, how it has affected us, if we ever caught it or anything because for reasons of them not, how do you say it them not making it more safe like safer.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: Oh, okay, 'cause I came from a different prison, right, I came from a different prison. Now I’m on crisis bed right now.</br></br> 

Pretty much I got COVID because they pretty much weren’t going about the, I don’t know exactly how to say it, though, but the way, the way they brought a bunch of people that were quarantined already with it, and they pretty much just threw them all out there and in the same group as us and let them interact with us. And then we ended up catching COVID, and I end up getting sick, and then I ended up going on suicide watch because it made me so much stressed out that I didn’t want to live no more because if they didn’t give a shit about our about our health and care why should I care, you know.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: So this was at Wasco State Prison in March of, what was it.</br></br> 

UCI: Of this year?</br></br>

Caller: No, of 19 when the pandemic just barely started.</br></br>  

UCI: Oh.</br></br>

Caller: And I’m still going through quarantines and all that still ‘till this day, and it’s weird because they keep doing all these random rapid testing and all that, but, you know, none of us, none of us here got it, and they keep, they keep having the police they got this thing going.</br></br> 

The police right here, they got this thing where since this is the, since this is the pandemic or whatever it’s called they, they got two weeks, they get two weeks, they - not two weeks paid relief and days off and shit. And they get to call in even if they’re not sick or not, and they do that they can call in sick. I don’t know how to explain it, I don’t know how to explain it, but there’s a bunch of shit that be going on in here that’s weird.</br></br> 

UCI: Do you mean the - the guards and stuff are bringing it in?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, yeah they’re - they, they bring it in here, they bring it in here they, they go in and out, you know what I mean, and they bring it back and forth. And then they shut us down because they want to call in and say they’re sick because they want to get that two weeks free pay. They shut us down and then we don’t have no program or anything, you know, we’re just stuck in the room miserable for up to 30 days sometimes.</br></br>

UCI: Wow, yeah that’s not good.</br></br>

Caller: And another thing you ain’t getting no program, you ain’t coming out, you ain’t getting no phone calls, you ain’t getting nothing.</br></br> 

UCI: So, has it been better at all recently, I know some facilities are getting the vaccine, not all of them but—</br></br> 

Caller: Well, they’re giving out the vaccines and stuff, and me I refuse it because I already caught COVID, you know what I mean, at the last facility I was at, and they’re giving out the vaccine. But me, I’m scared to take it. Honestly, I’ll be straight up with you.</br></br> 

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: I don’t, I don’t know what you guys, what are you guys looking for, what do you guys want just, just random talk?</br></br>

UCI: Just anything you’re willing to share about your experience. What you think they could have done differently, what you think they could have done better.</br></br>

Caller: I think there are a lot of things they could have done better, like the way, the way I caught it, for instance, instead of housing us all together. They should have isolated some individuals to a different unit, like it took them, it took them 6 months to finally get it right for them to actually isolate them and then keep the ones that weren’t, ones that weren’t exposed to them separate, you know what I mean?</br></br>  

UCI: Yeah.</br></br> 

Caller: There’s a bunch of stuff, I don’t, I don’t know exactly what you guys want me to say, but it’s kind of, it’s kind of bad, you know what I mean? It still, it still is, you know, all they do is just sit on their ass, and we’re stuck in here, you know. All they do is keep us locked in that room, and there ain’t nothing else but to do, like today we barely got off on Wednesday quarantine and they’re barely letting us out to interact, you know what I mean? We lose, we lose our visits, we lose everything, you know?</br></br> 

UCI: Yeah, so I’m curious, have they been giving you guys stuff to clean? Do they clean?</br></br>

Caller: Hell no, they, they keep their area clean, but they don’t give us nothing to clean.</br></br>

UCI: Oh.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, they don’t give us nothing.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah. It sounds like that would not be good and that would lead to a lot of people getting sick.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah. So, so me, I keep myself clean but I use my shampoo and all that to clean my room and, that’s not even disinfectant or anything.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah. Wow. What about other people that you are around? Do they try to get you guys to social distance? Do you guys have to wear masks?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, we wear masks and stuff but they, it ain’t no, there ain't really no distance everyone’s hugging, everyone’s shaking hands. Everyone’s walking around, you know, even with the COs and everything.</br></br>

UCI: Oh.</br></br> 

Caller: They come from different floors, communicate with each other. They think this all some type of little joke and shit in here.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, that can be really hard if people don’t take it seriously.</br></br> 

Caller: Yeah, no right .</br></br>

UCI: What do you - what else do you want people to know about what you experienced at the other facility you were at and at the one you’re at now?</br></br>

Caller: I just hope that everything gets better, you know, and the pandemic, people take it serious, you know because it is real, you know. It ain’t fake, and yeah, that’s all.</br></br> 

UCI: Yeah, where you’re at now compared to where you were before are things different?</br></br> 

Caller: Yeah, it’s a little more different. It’s still a little bit, a little bit more ways of they could make it better, but this will do, you know, it’s better than where I was at before like 10 times better.</br></br>

UCI: Oh, how have you been coping with everything and when you had COVID and—</br></br> 

Caller: Listen, I’m still barely getting over everything, you know, because I'm still here, you know. I got very sick, I was in the ICU, not ICU, but I was in the infirmary here where they had me on IVs and all that because my body wasn’t holding no food in, my - they had to feed me through a tube and everything.</br></br>  

UCI: Wow.</br></br>

Caller: Because my body wasn’t keeping no food or anything inside of it. Because I had COVID mixed in with because I had Hep C and then mixed in with the COVID it messed me up really bad.</br></br>

UCI: I'm curious, what the procedure is when someone gets COVID. How soon do they move you to the infirmary or does it just depend?</br></br>

Caller: Honestly, I can say I think it takes a long time. They keep that person in that, in that room they keep them in there isolated. He still comes out to go to interviews and stuff but that's about it.</br></br>  

UCI: Oh, do you, does the facility that you’re at have visitation right now?</br></br> 

Caller: Education?</br></br>  

UCI: Visits. Like visitation.</br></br>  

Caller: No, through the video chat I think they do but I haven’t got one because I’m always on quarantine and stuff.</br></br> 

UCI: Oh. Well, hopefully stuff starts to get better.</br></br> 

Caller: So, this is just you guys write to anybody or you guys just wrote to certain individuals?</br></br> 

UCI: I’m not on the letter writing team, I’m on the call team, but I’m pretty sure they are sending letters to a bunch of the California facilities and I think whoever they can get a hold of. We want to get the word out to as many people as we can.</br></br>  

Caller: I wish I knew how to explain things better, but it’s hard for me to explain things sometimes, you know. I ain’t, I ain’t that smart or like well I really ain’t got that much high school and stuff I got a diploma and everything, but I just got that from just sitting in class in juvenile hall and all that.</br></br> 

UCI: Oh, wow.</br></br> 

Caller: Yeah, I got that just for sitting there and just for showing up and I got, I got my diploma. So I really, I really don’t know sometimes how to explain it you know?</br></br>  

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>  

Caller: I can talk and everything and I can read a little, you know. I could read pretty good it's just, I just don’t know how to explain things sometimes in the right way and in - in the right order too sometimes. It’s all just jumps here and there.</br></br>  

UCI: Yeah. Did you grad–</br></br>  

Caller: I should have told you this from the beginning.</br></br> 

UCI: Im sorry what?</br></br> 

Caller: I said I should have told you this from the beginning.</br></br>

UCI: Oh no, it's okay.</br></br> 

Caller: Yeah.</br></br>

UCI: Well I don’t know if you, did you get a letter from us?</br></br> 

Caller: Yeah I got a letter from you guys and that’s how I’m calling you.</br></br> 

UCI: Okay.</br></br> 

Caller: I was wishing somebody would write – I was wishing somebody would write me – write to me, because, you know, I ain’t got no family or anything you know really, but I was wishing someone would write to me and you guys wrote me and this is the only – only time I get to call somebody.</br></br>  

UCI: Yeah, so we answer the phone Monday through Friday from 5:00 to 9:00 p.m. and so there’s always someone here to talk and then if you wanted to send a letter you can always send a letter also.</br></br>  

Caller: Yeah. I was thinking I should do it that way better because then, if I write a letter I’ll be able to have my thoughts down better, you know what I mean?</br></br>  

UCI: Yeah.</br></br> 

Caller: And not jumping everywhere.</br></br>
 
UCI: Yeah, that'll be good.</br></br>

Caller: I’m surprised that some of you, people out there really care, you know, because I just thought everyone forgot about us.</br></br> 

UCI: Yeah, theres a whole–</br></br> 

Caller: What are you guys doing? Is this for some college credit or something?</br></br> 

UCI: Yeah, so I’m doing it for a class for school to graduate. The project is called PrisonPandemic. So we're just getting people's experiences with the pandemic and trying to get the word out there that not all the facilities are taking it seriously and trying to get first-hand experiences.</br></br> 

Caller: Well, what’s a good time that I can call again where I’ll reach you? The same time like this on the same day?</br></br> 

UCI: Yeah.</br></br> 

Caller: Okay then I’ll wait –  I’ll get all my thoughts and everything together because the phone’s gonna hang up. Thank you for talking to me.</br></br> 

UCI: Okay thank you! Have a good night.</br></br>  

Caller: You too.
