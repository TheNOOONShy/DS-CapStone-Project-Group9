This story was told by a person incarcerated at Tulare South County Detention Center.</br></br>UCI: So you are saying they don't clean the phones at all? Like you've never seen them spray them down or like wipe them?</br></br>Caller: I mean, when I was in Hanford Jail, they would come in there immediately upon Ñ or would come in there and spray the phones down. And then the next people would use them.</br></br> 

They would spray them down between every individual. But here, they don't even have nothing to spray them down or, you know, to clean them with. You know?</br></br>As each person gets off, there should be something here to clean these phones. I mean, we could clean them ourselves, but we don't have no spray or anything to kill it with, you know? But, I mean, as far as I'm concerned, and then, you know, they sent [unintelligible] in like every other day to clean the showers.</br></br> 

And then we clean the unit, but that's every other day, you know? Sometimes we don't get to clean it every day, but sometimes we don't get Ñ it depends on what cops are working if we get to clean it at all.</br></br>You know? To me, it is about being Ñ you know what I mean? They want us to wear masks and all this even though we got vaccines and, you know, face shields. At least they get spray and some stuff to kill anything else that's lurking on the phones or the video visit things or the door handles, I mean, stuff like that. You know?
