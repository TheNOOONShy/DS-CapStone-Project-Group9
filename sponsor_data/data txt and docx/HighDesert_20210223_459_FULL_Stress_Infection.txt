Hello PrisonPandemic,</br></br>

Your message finds me in the best of health! Hope this letter finds you in the best of health as well. As we all come across difficult times in our lives with this whole pandemic. We're all dealing with it in different ways.</br></br>

I as well don’t know you personally, but glad you took the time to put a smile on my face. Thank you for your words of encouragement.</br></br>

Now experience inside this facility during the COVID-19 pandemic is no place to be. It’s like I have my hands tied, unable to do anything. Had family pass away from this virus! I as well had COVID and went through all the symptoms; was not a good feeling whatsoever.</br></br>

We try our best to be safe and clean, because prison is a dirty environment. But me, myself, has to only worry about myself so I don’t catch this virus again. I haven’t had a visit while in prison, so couldn’t really answer that question.</br></br>

I take things one day at a time and hopes to someone writes me. Is why I said you put a smile on my face! Thanks! Can I ask, how is my story going to lead to positive reforms?</br></br>

Thanks again for believing in me and hope to hear from you again.</br></br>

Best wishes.
