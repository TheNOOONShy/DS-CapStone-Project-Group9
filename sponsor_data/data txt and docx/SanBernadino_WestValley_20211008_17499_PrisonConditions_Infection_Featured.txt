UCI: How are you doing tonight?</br></br>

Caller: I'm pretty good. It's been a rough day. We've had a lot of fistfights in the pod. I'm at West Valley. This is the closest I've been to COVID during the whole pandemic, being in jail.</br></br>

It seems like we're being subjected to COVID. We're not forced to wear masks in our pod. And the only time we have to have one is when we leave the door and go outside, to a doctor or to court.</br></br>

If we go outside to the day room, on the outside â€” we have an outside day room - to get some fresh air, we don't have to wear them out there. We don't have to wear masks on the inside. I've witnessed our toilets be filled to the brim for over a week with poop overflowing onto the floor, or the men were pooping in the shower in order to have a place to go.</br></br> 

I reported that to the doctor. It took another about five days before they come and cleaned it up. They finally got the toilets working again, but that was quite a nightmare.</br></br>

And on a daily basis, they bring new inmates in. And we don't know where they come from, and they're not wearing a mask when they come in, and it just kind of seems ridiculous that - that we have this going on, and we're not being protected. I try to wear a mask at all times when I'm inside here just to avoid everybody else so that I don't catch it.</br></br> 

I have tested negative three or four times.
