This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Chino.</br></br>

I asked my C/O work supervisor what tests staff undergo entering the prison each day. He stated only temperatures were checked. My own worry increased.</br></br> 

Around the last ten (10) days of April, the first suspected inmate COVID-case was taken from building A-5. Then another, several days later. Soon about % a dozen inmates had disappeared after complaining about feeling unwell. We never heard whether they tested positive or not.</br></br> 

On May 1, 2020, the Institution finally tested ALL the Building 5 inmates for COVID-19. On May 3, 2020 I felt symptoms. Headaches, cough, slight fever, sore muscles...etc. Later that same day about 15-20 inmates were removed from A5 to "C" yard for COVID quarantine.</br></br> 

The following day, other reportedly "positive" inmates were moved around the building (A5) to "distance" them from those "negative" (like me). By May 5th, approximately 90 (ninety) "positive" inmates had been moved to one side of A5, with myself and about 20 "negatives" moved to the other. Without any additional testing, the prison moved about 1/2 a dozen of these "negatives" to other uninfected buildings.</br></br> 

None of us ("positives" or "negatives") were required to wear our masks while "in our bunk areas" or actually "on" our bunks. And we all freely moved about, and shared showers, toilets, sinks, and â€˜AIR" - though I avoided the "positives" like the plague (pun intended).</br></br> 

The fans at either end of the building continued to circulate the "viral soup" of everyone's coughs, sneezes, and other airborne spittle. Oddly, the institution took away the C-Pap machines for those inmates with breathing problems saying those machines "might" put infected breath-vapor into the air. (?!) No follow-up testing was done on those who tested negative!</br></br>

My inmate work assignment in A5 was 2nd Lead Porter in charge of keeping the building clean during the pandemic. In the month(s) prior to the pandemic's arrival, the institution actually began cutting back on the disinfectant issued to the building(s). My 3/W cleaning crew found it difficult to cover all the areas newly included as "at risk" locations.</br></br> 

During a Captain's meeting in our building weeks prior, I boldly asked the Captain the reason for the cutbacks at this time. Her response was that we were being issued what the prison determined necessary. We "Porters" bought laundry detergent at the canteen to help deal with the prison's cut back.</br></br>

I personally used a 1 gallon bug sprayer to spray disinfectant on all common areas and on mattresses vacated by inmates removed from the building for medical attention or quarantine elsewhere. But it was impossible to let disinfectant sit for the required 10 minutes on sinks/toilets, et al, that are in constant use/demand by everyone. We needed bleach.</br></br> 

Nursing staff/doctors came to our building and took "vitals" after inmates began reporting COVID symptoms. They only took the temperatures of us "negatives" to determine our health. They checked the "positives" by testing temperature, blood pressure, and 02 blood saturation. (I witnessed MANY of the "positives" showing normal temperatures. 99.5 degrees and below was considered "normal". I thought about the testing the C/O's were given in order to come to work each day.)
