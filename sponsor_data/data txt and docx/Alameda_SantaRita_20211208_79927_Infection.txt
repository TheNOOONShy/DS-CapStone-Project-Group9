Caller: Is there anything you would want to know specifically?<br></br>

UCI: How is the vaccine process going at your facility?<br></br>

Caller: So, they, I haven’t got my vaccine since I’ve been here, but I know you’re eligible to get your vaccine whenever you want. Not whenever you want, but they got to schedule a date for certain vaccines. They’ll come - they’ll come and schedule an appointment with you and give you your vaccine.<br></br>

I think there’s three different shots you’re supposed to get? And they’ll give you a vaccine card when you leave here.<br></br>

UCI: Have you seen a lot of people getting vaccinated, including staff?<br></br>

Caller: I’m pretty sure staff had to get vaccinated, but since I’ve been here – I’ve been here with [unintelligible] for at least a year and what I know, there’s been about three, four people get it.<br></br>

My other cellie is one. But, and if we complain about having a cold or anything, we’ll go on – we’ll go on lockdown for a two-week period where we cannot go to court, and we all got to come out one by one.<br></br>

UCI: Wow, that must be so difficult.
