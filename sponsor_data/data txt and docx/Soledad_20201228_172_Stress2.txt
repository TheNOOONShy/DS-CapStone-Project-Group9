This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Soledad.</br></br>

This worried the inmate population very much because, we knew that the only way we would contract COVID-19 is if it were brought into us by someone going to the outside and coming back into the prison.</br></br> 

So we used the grievance process to voice our complaints and issues, but CDCR either denied our complaints as non-valid or partially granted some, while they scrambled to make necessary adjustments and passing out masks.</br></br> 

I was especially concerned about the safety of those who, like myself, have underlying conditions that can lead to complications or death, and elderly. I worry mainly because I know firsthand how deliberately indifferent CDCR can be when it comes to the health and safety of the prisoners within its facilities.
