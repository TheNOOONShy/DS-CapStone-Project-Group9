This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Fresno Mendota Federal Center.</br></br>

They have keep us from our families and I have gone across state and then back to California to the holding in Victorville for quarantine again. This place Mendota is the worse so far, because I am here to do my time and there are others that are doing their time still locked up in this unit going on six weeks and not let out to use the phone or out to the yard to get some air.</br></br>

This is the yard we are to be at and there is no reason that we can’t go out to the yard, but lack of people doing their job and we can see it every day here. They have a job to do and it seems like they don’t want to do anything but sit around and get a paycheck.</br></br>

Most of the time medical don’t do anything for you at all, but try to give you a shot for the vaccine even when there is no need for it. I have already had the COVID-19 flu, but it was nothing. No smell or taste. That is all I had. Now I have to get the shot or they are never going to let me out of this holding or at least that is what it feels like.</br></br>

So I hope that I helped someone and if you like you can get back at me again. Thanks again.
