Dear Ms. [redacted]</br></br>

Hey this is [redacted], the guy you wrote to talking about how life is like in prison during the pandemic, and you wanted me to tell my side of the story well here it goes:</br></br>

Like everyone else, each and every story is different, my life in here is honestly rough. This is my first time in prison and I’m not even from California. I’m 20 years old and has a lot of growing up to do. I’m waking up everyday upset about life even though I only got 2-3 years left.</br></br>

I’m adopted so I have adopted parents. They passed away while I was in jail. So basically I’m on my own with no family support. I have real parents/ biological parents but all they’ve been doing is making fun of me and putting me down so I on really know what to say about them, if your asking, no they do support me one bit. I don’t have family, friends, cousins, nothing to help support me, write to me, send me stuff etc.</br></br>

Not trying to make everybody feel sorry for me because I have nobody or nothing to support me, like I said everybody's story is different. Now being in here on top of everything else makes my time 10 times worse. Again with my family I get no visits, nobody to talk to on the phone but I do see a few other inmates get visits once a month. It's always good to see the guys come back all happy because they just had a visit with their family and or loved ones.</br></br>

To be honest being inside here is alright, I mean there’s nothing really to do, I’m still in reception so I am still waiting on the bus to main line. I already got scratched 3 times so that’s making me mad, I have no one to write to, nobody to talk to on the phone, no books to read except the bible, but the days are flying like crazy which I’m happy. We go outside at least 4 days a week which is cool but we have to wear our masks which is really annoying because I can’t breathe with it on.</br></br>

This whole situation is stressing me out like hell. People tell me all the time why am I stressing if I got 2-3 years left, but it’s funny, everybody got family support and money so they can buy stuff and talk to they family and loved ones on phones and visits and get letters and pictures and such and I don’t get nothing. I’m not sounding desperate or nothing, again everybody’s story is different.</br></br>

I do have people then and there give me some food or cosmetics because they see how bad I have it and they tend to give my 1 or 2 soup or some soap to wash myself. I know it’s that bad, I don’t even have soap to wash myself with. Oh well life goes on. I wish I had a phone to get ahold of people that I actually consider as family (they my friends) but I forgot I’m in prison.</br></br>

Other than that prison is prison, there’s nothing I can do about it, just trying to do my time and get out and continue life. Hopefully this story helps you out in a way, not just for you but to whoever reads it that you just have to do the best you can and live life to the fullest. Thanks again for writing to me.</br></br>

Sincerely.
