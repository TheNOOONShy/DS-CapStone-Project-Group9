This story was told by a person incarcerated at Solano.</br></br>

Caller: Also, when we were in the dorms originally, they were separating the bunk beds, so they we're actually practicing social distancing.</br></br>UCI: Mhmm.</br></br>Caller: But now that we’re in this, we’re in this gymnasium hospital ward, this ward that really actually been condemned by the court, now there’s no social distancing. They have men packed in here like sardines now. We’re side by side. There’s over 100 and some odd men in here, and they’re bringing them in.</br></br>

They bring one out, they take one out, they bring two in. So it’s just overcrowded, and the conditions are just, it’s just horrible in here. It's just crazy. So we’re stacked in here like sardines and dominos, and they don’t care.
