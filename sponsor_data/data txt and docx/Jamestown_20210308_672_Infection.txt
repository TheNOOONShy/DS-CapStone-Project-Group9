This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Jamestown.</br></br>

The absurdities continue, correctional officers did not wear their facial coverings for nearly all of the pandemic’s year long time frame! Neither would their employees enforce that they did. I filed a grievance about it, and guess what I was told.</br></br>

I was told that the sergeant for third watch, that he was not going to investigate his officers. But he would investigate the cameras to see if I wore mine, along with the other inmates!</br></br>

I wrote the warden to inform him of our eighth amendment right to safety was being violated by his officers not wearing their masks while performing their duties. Like always he lied in his answer to me that all SCC staff were wearing their masks. Then some 60 days later, I got an answer from the appeals office about my grievance, and it said that grieving about staff wearing masks, was outside the scope of their grievance process!</br></br>

One day, 30 some odd inmates were brought to this facility on my yard, from fire camp, who were COVID-19 positive. This is prison, and everyone here knows that when fire campers show up from camp, they may have smuggled drugs or tobacco too! Those dorms were not quarantined they were just housed in a dorm by themselves.</br></br>

Everyone had access to them, and what inmate has no drug addiction problems? Staff allowed for them to be accessed and the beginning of history was going to be made.</br></br>

The virus spread like crazy, and on 12-6-20, a program status report was distributed to the inmates. It told us what the count was of positive COVID-19 cases, what dorms were quarantined and when they were quarantined.</br></br>

On 12-6-20, four inmates were moved into dorm 69 where I was housed, from dorms 51 and 53. Those four inmates would make the count in out dorm-32 of 32, full capacity. Not only would they expose inmates to the virus, but they would expose as many as possible. Four days later, every person was positive for COVID-19. </br></br>

The program status sheet made staff aware of the fact those inmates were housed in a quarantined dorm for only nine days.</br></br>

Our entire dorm knew it too, and we watched inmates from 51 and 53 all day long get hauled off in wheelchairs with COVID-19. So when they came to our dorm door, we laid down in front of the dorm’s door to non-violently protest and orally grieve the dangerous moves being made that would subject us to a seriously communicable disease.</br></br>

Third watch ordered the exposed inmates to step over our bodies. And one youngster stood up so as not to be stepped over, and was thrown down to the ground and cuffed up and told he would be getting a shu term. The rest of us were threatened that if we prevented the exposed inmates from entering the dorms, we would be sent to a general population yard.</br></br>

To understand the severity of that threat, I must explain to you the changes made on lower yards like this one. This yard consists of half protective custody inmates and half general population inmates. And is referred to as a non-designated program yard/facility (NDPF).</br></br>

As far as the higher level inmates are concerned, all NDPF inmates are protective custody, and will be attacked violently and ruthlessly. General population inmates are found in the higher levels of prison where they would rather die than live with a protective custody inmate, or kill!</br></br>

Needless to say, the threat of an adverse action like being sent to where we would be killed, effectively chilled our non-violent oral grievance, and the first amendment says we can make freely. Four days later we were all COVID-19 positive!</br></br>

The moves that had been made on 12-15-20 were not only moves made that would expose inmates to the seriously communicable disease of COVID-19. We were locked down completely and the entire yard somehow got infected with COVID-19. Blame it on the wind, rain, and everything else, but I know that we were part of an illegal herd immunity experiment. And prison officials deliberately exposed us COVID-19.</br></br>
