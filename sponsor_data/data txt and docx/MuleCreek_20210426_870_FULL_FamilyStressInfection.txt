Dear Prison Pandemic,</br></br>

I’m 38 years old. During the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic I was scared because at first, I didn’t know what it was, but I seen on the news that people who got this virus die from it.</br></br>

So I was in a panic because I didn’t want to get it and die in prison before I get freedom to get out and go live with my family during the pandemic. Now I’m happy because I didn’t get it and die. I also got my both shots of Pfizer so I’m 90 percent immune.</br></br>

Anyway family visiting I don’t get, because the majority of my family were criminals. They all did time in prison. How I feel about my safety in prison is my protection so I don’t get it when I get released from prison.</br></br>

Me coping with this crisis, I color in adult color books to help me keep my fear down and my mood at ease. Because I have anxiety and I stress a lot, but I could go to my adult color book and color to keep my mind busy and off of this COVID-19.</br></br>

I will say that two of my family members got the COVID-19 and survived but got real sick after they got it. My dad was one of my family members who got it. My grandma was the second family member who got it, they both survived.
