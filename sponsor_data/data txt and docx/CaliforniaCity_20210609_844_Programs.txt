UCI: Now that, everybody that, like you said, most of the population is vaccinated, do you think that they'll revamp your guys' programming anytime soon?</br></br>

So, what they do is they like - they they like find little reasons not to run the program, you know? It's 'cause they got too used to not doing nothing, the cops.</br></br>

UCI: I see.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah. Now that they have to do stuff, they're like - they're like finding little reasons not to run it.</br></br>

UCI: And so, do you think like - and how does that make you feel, like that they're not wanting to give you guys your programming?</br></br>

Caller: That's what gets everybody mad.</br></br>

UCI: Right? Makes me mad too.</br></br>
