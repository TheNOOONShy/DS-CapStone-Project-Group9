This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Solano.</br></br>

I tested positive for COVID-19 on December 10, 2020. I was placed into isolation in the gymnasium that was eventually packed with over 107 prisoners (not including staff) mostly double bunked. Many people felt they did not have the virus and voiced their concerns but, went unheard. Some knew they had it.</br></br>

While in the gym, I reported to the medical staff of the multiple symptoms that I was experiencing. For example, loss of taste and smell, diarrhea, shortness of breath, drowsiness, cold chills, headaches, and confusion.</br></br>

I received no medical attention except temperature, oxygen, and heart rate checks two times a day. As we were all told is mandated because we (prisoners) can’t be trusted with the truth. So they have to run tests on us to see if we have COVID or not.</br></br> 

Funny thing is, is that the whole time I did all that they asked, none of these tests showed any indication that I was experiencing unusual activity. Yet I know I was positive and so did the medical.</br></br>

After 10 to 12 days in in isolation I was cleared by medical to move to another building. I was told that I have to pack all my property and put it into the chapel or dining hall for three days, while it goes through a decontamination period. We were told that we can’t even bring our cosmetic essentials because it too  was to go into decontamination. Most of us hid what was needed under our jumpsuits.</br></br>

There was a time while in the gym that a lot of doctors, wardens, and representatives came to tell us about COVID. We ended up asking them questions about, how come we are so packed in and can’t keep six feet distance apart? How come we can’t bring with us our towels, washrags, bars of soap, comb, shampoo, toothpaste, toothbrush, shower shoes, deodorant and etc. to keep ourselves clean?</br></br>

We were told they did not know that was going on and that we (doctor representative?) would look into it and get back to us, he never did. They also told us (when asked) once we complete the isolation period we are resolved. They said, we “can no longer catch it or give it to someone else for 90 days”. And that we can move to any building and get all our programs back.</br></br>

I was then moved to another building which was quarantined at the time. Even though I was told I was resolved, I was kept in quarantine without dayroom activities, without yard, and without going to work for another 16 days. Once receiving our first yard it was discovered another person in the building who wasn’t positive before tested positive now. So we went back on quarantine again.</br></br>

Some prisoners started refusing to test because out of fear they will be moved from one yard to another, building to building. Our MAC representatives set up another meeting with medical and custody. They asked them why are we still locked down?</br></br>

Their response was because a group of people are refusing to test, so we are going to remain on lockdown until they test.
