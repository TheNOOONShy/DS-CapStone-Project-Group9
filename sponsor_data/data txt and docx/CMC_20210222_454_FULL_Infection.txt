Hello, PrisonPandemic,</br></br>

How are you feeling today? I sincerely hope that you and your family are all doing well. As for me, I'm fine. They have been moving us around to keep us separated from those who test positive. The strain here has been very weak and mild so no one gets really sick. No high temperature or symptoms.</br></br>

They can't do very much considering the over crowdedness of the prison population but for now it seems that they have it pretty much under control.</br></br>

Thank you for the uplifting though. Your words of wisdom and kindness and all truly did touch me. It's not often that I hear from women from the outside either. Especially a pleasant surprise of this nature. Where have you been all my life?</br></br> 

I'm sure hoping that this was a godsend and that you were lead to me so I would achieve this opportunity to be sent to you. Sometimes this can be a lonely place without real true love and compatibility from a honest caring sweetheart.</br></br>

You are very much appreciated in the work you are doing to see that we are being treated appropriately so. If you would like to stay in touch and you haven't seen me, go to Facebook and see my picture that I just put online. And if you are interested please follow your heart and know that you are welcome. I come home this year and you can call my moms for further concerns.</br></br> 

Thanks again for writing to me. Hope to hear from you again.</br></br>

Sincerely.
