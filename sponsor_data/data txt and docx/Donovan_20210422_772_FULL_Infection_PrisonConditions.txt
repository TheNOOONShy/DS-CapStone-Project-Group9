This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Donovan.</br></br>

Thank you for writing me and especially for expressing concern for me. It has been difficult to try and take care of myself during a pandemic. I am from San Diego, so I’m glad to be doing my time in a prison close to home. When COVID first hit we (in prison) were untouched for a good while health wise.</br></br> 

We were locked down and given cloth masks.</br></br> 

Since we inmates are the ones who run the kitchen, there was no one to cook fresh food. We were stuck with a pre-packaged “sack lunch” for breakfast, lunch, and dinner! That sucked! The correctional officers (prison guards) finally brought COVID-19 to us.</br></br> 

It spread quickly. I got it and experienced scary symptoms. I’m thankful to be alive! My celly was bed-ridden for a few days.</br></br>

Three people died in my building alone. We weren’t allowed any visitors. I only have my grandma. She’s in her 80s!</br></br> 

She still hasn’t been vaccinated! (Nobody in there to help her get an appointment). I worry about her. I call her “Mami”.</br></br> 

What about the proletariat? One reform should be inmates who have nobody to help them should get a real job with livable wages. To pay off restitution is mandatory, they take 55 percent of any money I get. My job pays 0.8 cents an hour.</br></br> 

I make $5.00 dollars a month! We should get a higher minimum wage!</br></br>

I am now vaccinated thank God. Pfizer. Both shots. They said 0.00 percent have caught the rona after vaccinations were given. So, hopefully it’s good.</br></br> 

The spaceman drawing is a part. I feel isolated like I have been left on Mars to fend for myself. They say the IRS is giving checks, even to inmates. As luck would have it, I applied and haven’t received any money.</br></br> 

I’m a 32 year, Mexican-American. I just want to be comfortable and drug-free when I get out. I’m just gonna work and be with family and a few friends. I love San Diego.</br></br> 

It’s a shame I live here but only get to see it through a TV screen. Ironic.</br></br> 

Well, thanks for asking how I am. I hope you all are well. Write back if you want. It's boring here. Go Anteaters.</br></br> 

Respectfully,</br></br>

PS. You can use this for whatever. God bless you. Thank you for recognizing me as a human.</br></br>

PSS. I don’t know but I’m sending a package request. Possibly, you can donate to my efforts! To survive! I am so sorry for asking for a handout, but I was taught a closed mouth gets nothing!
