Probably the biggest issue I have seen is the CDCR’s slow, reactive, and ineffective management of outbreaks. In March or April, there was a big outbreak in Chino. So CDCR decided to bus a bunch of guys from Chino to other facilities, mainly San Quentin. Lo and behold, early summer, San Quentin explodes with Coronavirus cases, and a court mandate that they either release of relocate half of San Quentin’s inmate population.</br></br>

Early October, San Quentin shipped off a bunch of their population in order to get to half capacity in accordance with court mandates. Here at CTF Soledad, we had a massive outbreak that coincided perfectly with the reception of a massive influx of San Quentin inmates. I find it tragic that CDCR not only created a second outbreak at San Quentin, an action that could be written off as a tragic mishap but then they repeated the process here at CTF Soledad, to identical results.</br></br>

This highlights a real problem with CDCR, a lack of oversight and impotent overseers. Going back to 2012 or 2013 when the three judge panel mandated that CDCR get to within 125 percent of capacity. The CDCR dragging their feet, sought and were given numerous extension, hid bed counts by transporting inmates, and flooded county jails with state prisoners.</br></br>

When Proposition 57 was passed, CDCR fought it and only implemented it for select groups and almost a year beyond its passing. The CDCR and their associated also try and tried to pass subsequent legislation to effectively neuter Prop-57.</br></br>

Probably the biggest on me relating to COVID-19 in prison has been the effective terminations of program. I went to Narcotics Anonymous, Toastmastus, Red Ladder, and Veterans Healing Veterans, as well as to college. That all shut down last March. I have sought to engage in distance learning and correspondence work through group like PREP/Turning Point and GOGI – Getting Out by Going In, but it’s a far cry from what I was doing.</br></br> 

I never received visits, so shutting down visiting was not a major issue for me. To be honest, the free phone days that Global Tel-Link provided were my first calls home since 2012, so that was a bonus. That said, a lot of guys in here depend on regular visits to maintain not only contact with family, but also it helps them to remain sane and to keep up hope.</br></br>
