This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Pleasant Valley.</br></br>

It's been a positive, and a negative experience for me. I was worried about my loved ones on a daily basis out there. With limited contact, there was this period from November of 2020 to December of 2020 we went without phone calls to our loved ones. Like a whole month we were being denied phone calls here at Pleasant Valley State Prison. Mail was drastically being delayed, and whenever I would get a letter it would be three to four weeks late or later.</br></br>

It caused a lot of stress and anger. Then all of the sudden I tested positive for COVID-19 sometime in November. I lost my taste and my smell for about two weeks, I also had a slight cough, and a little pressure on my chest. It was terrible. I was quarantined for two weeks. It was really the worst experience.
