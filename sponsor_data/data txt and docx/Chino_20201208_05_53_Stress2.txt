This story was told by a person incarcerated at Chino.</br></br>

Caller: It's so hard to just- to do it justice without somebody being able to see it. Because if you could see a situation in which a lot of us are living- itâ€™s scary. Everybody- I sit there every day and I wonder is today going to be the day that I get sick?</br></br> 

Because I worry, am I going to be the person that's next? Am I the person that's going to go out in an ambulance next? And am I ever going to see the people that I know and that I love again?</br></br>

You just don't know. Because there's nothing being done because they don't care. Even the staff members who are required to own certain PPE and wear masks- they're not doing it. They're not doing it.</br></br>

So and then, yeah, it's just really frustrating. And this environment, if you could see the inside of these buildings where we're living, you're like, it's it's no wonder that more of these people are not dead. It's amazing to me, this facility should have been shut down. And yet, here we are and now they're packing more people back into it.
