This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Solano.</br></br>Which brings me to how I feel about my safety. Being that a lot of inmate have issues with coping skills, it's only magnified by 10,000 in this time of crisis. And what really stands out to me is that inmates celled together for such a long time in the cell are fighting each other more frequently. And a lot of the times ending in one of them being killed by the other.</br></br> 

As far as safety concerns to COVID-19 is even more scary the governor and the Center for Disease Control suggest no movement. But CDCR has moved several inmates from San Quentin Prison here and since then COVID has been spreading. And a building I was housed in had several inmates that tested positive for COVID. They moved them to a building for positive COVID inmates and put the rest of the building on quarantine and continue to test for more positive inmates.</br></br>They moved me to a building with non-positive inmates without even knowing if I was positive or not while I was already in a building on quarantine. Which later the building they move me to soon after began inmate testing positive. Also, several inmates tested positive in cells  which they left there in the building for over two weeks and they knew they had tested positive. I don’t know if they didn’t have the room to move them or they were experimenting with us in enclosed settings.
