In October of 2020, they put me in block one, 18 days later, I get tested in November 2020 for transfer.</br></br>

The test was the 15 minutes test and I came back positive for some reason. I say no reason because the entire block one was completely empty, just five of us in there only. That was the same day for transfer.</br></br>

We all tested at the same time and I’m the only one that came back positive. To me, it was a bunch of bullshit. Us five guys together - cut it out!</br></br>

Since I missed that bus, I waited for two more weeks and then I was ready to transfer again, so they tested me again, and again, I tested positive. And this time being in there so long, I got it since they began bringing people in who have it so I had no choice but to get it. When I was in block two, I was just fine.</br></br>

They tested me about six times, and when it came back positive. They would come back two days later and take a real test, send it to the lot on the streets and it takes three to five days to come back. And they all come back negative except for the last one.</br></br>

I believed it because I got a fever from hell that night, hot, super hot, like all my friends back in February, but it was gone the next day. Then I got a sore throat and then I lost my taste. I’m barely getting my taste back now.</br></br>

I strongly believe that these people putting me in block A, the block they use for COVID, I got it. They should have left me in block two and transferred me and tested me there. There I was just fine. Have no money for an attorney or I would have got one because I know they’re doing things incorrectly.</br></br>

They began test the entire yard because staff brought it in and inmates tested positive, so now the building one block is full of positive inmates.</br></br>

Since I’ve already been in block one for two months already and all transfers have been stopped, again, since COVID is so high out there, these people moved me back to block two. Awaiting transfer again. So when I’m ready to transfer, again, back to block two, they want to move me to block one and do it again. That’s where we will have a problem.</br></br> 

I’m not going back to block one ever again for them, to make me get it again. Won’t do it. They moved me back to block two in December of 2020. I have all these dates in my mind because I know these people are incorrect in what they’re doing to me.
