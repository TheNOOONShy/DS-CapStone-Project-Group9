This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Mule Creek.</br></br>


In your letter, you said you’re collecting these stories to “preserve” them in an “archive” for historical-purposes with the “goal” that they could help lead to positive-reforms. Just within this year alone, in this prison, there have been three murders. I can’t even number the “assaults.”</br></br>


Everyday there is a “cell-conflict.” Even some taking serious-steps of committing suicide, because they felt there was no-other way out or taking a sharp-object and cutting themselves to get the attention they needed, because staff don’t want to stop, listen, try and fix the problem.</br></br>


Hunger strikes, the extreme measure to those who will take those “measure” and force those in charge to do what needed to be done and bring “relief,” when it shouldn’t have had to go that distance from the start!!!</br></br>


Human beings who go through each-day never knowing what can happen moment by moment trying to erase their pain, shame, guilt, in anything pleasurable that satisfies their “desires.” Seeking “peace” and trying to soothe their “consciences.”</br></br>


Predators walking around full of “emotion,” lacking the “intellect” to help them to deal with prejudice, racism, materialism, patriotism, greed, selfishness, created with a “sexual-impulse.” Denied a maternal release by marriage and with someone you respect and love and want to enjoy that intimate act, as sexual beings.</br></br>


Turning to the illusion of someone who changed the appearance they were made in, and groping for some affection and intimacy in a false-hood. Those who participate in any of that activity cause themselves constant-pain. The drama of that “world” is like a dog chasing its tail. A vicious-cycle of self-inflicted-pain!!!</br></br>


In one-form or another, a “victim,” raped by the system, the board wants the human-being to learn the two back ends of life!!! One, have you learned to submit to “authority” and obey them. Two, have you learned to respect the value of life.</br></br>


Here’s a story for your archives. A man off of “death-row” county jail, searching for some “relief” through the “courts.” He wasn’t like the rest of the “prisoners,” per say homie.</br></br>


Regular, when somebody is not of the “mold,” you’re treated as a “out-cast,” different, just like what the earthly-population goes through everyday. He lived two-cells from me. Had gotten into practicing how to “self-hypnotize” him-self!!!</br></br>


I was cooking sandwiches one-night, saved up cheese and bologna from the “lunch.” This human-being that night called over to me and asked me if I had or could I send him something to eat. I could “sense” his request registered by those around me and I could feel the “beast” breathing its foul stench of “hate,” “dislike,” and I let that ugly aroma make me to deny that human-being the decency-dignity of comfort of giving to his need of human law or respect!!!</br></br>


I said no! That same night, hours later, he absolutely took his own-life! Hanging himself from the vent.</br></br>


Just think, if I had been strong enough to not allow myself to be trapped by the “noem?!” Do we always do the right-thing?! I’ve come to know that it is easy to be a coward.</br></br>


The train of our “errors” upon ourselves and upon others, you can’t change or undo, but, I’ve learned, that true peace can only come by making peace with our creator Jehovah. When we are so tired of the January through December monotonous-redundancy that mankind treads too.</br></br>


Then, we reach out for the “real-life.” 1 Timothy 6:17-19. No more “pain,” “anxiety,” “weary,” “death,” or what causes death! This peaceful-picture is what Jehovah “promises” and intends to do for His creation, us, human beings who naturally crave permanent peace, no-more suffering, Revelation 21:1-5.</br></br>


We even pray for God’s will to be done on earth as it is in Heaven! Matt. 6:10, peace, that thousand years of restoration on earth is very, very, near. You’re being invited to learn that “truth.” That is a “goal” you are absolutely guaranteed to inherit, Matthew 5:5, I humbly respect your intentions to try and better this prison-system and help those who have been “seduced” by greed and free-commodity.</br></br>


Merchants of everyday commercialism prey on mankind’s lust for power and money and the end-result is the earth being full of its corpses of human beings who are victimized by false-religion and political elements of rulership.
