Dear PrisonPandemic,</br></br>
Hello, to the nursing students UC Irvine. Thank you for writing to me and having your concerns about others and myself, and about COVID-19 pandemic. You know I am a mother and do get concern about other mothers and their young children. It makes me wonder about our aging process because there are so many people that are becoming deceased about the subject.</br></br> 

The pandemic has hit the globe nationwide. I do wonder about other countries, and their beloved ones. I surely, know that my children are safe. You know if you could help.</br></br>
 
If I had the means a typewriter comes in handy. I would type or I could write letters to ensure everyone that is going to be alright. If I had the addresses and contacts, to let them know how to take care of themselves and be on advocate on how they can get the medication for COVID-19.</br></br>

Let me allow you to visit me, and we can talk about certain objectives and options on how we can inform others. And I am looking for career in nursing. Please rush me some information more about your hospital, and pamphlet brochure about the different characters that are related to the nursing occupation. I would love to be an advocate.</br></br> 

Please also ensure me with some materials to work with.</br></br>
I work with FEMA and weatherization, I can work in the sterilization room or bacterial control, or janitor. But for now, I need some printed images, such as anything you can say, anything for children. Visit me, please bring gifts with you. I need PK, coloring pencils, preferably 24 cents would help, and a medium of coloring pages. Please, I hope I am not asking for too much please send mind through systems.</br></br> 

But also, some personal appearances about three times a month and up to 15 pages, three times a week. You know there a lot of belongings to those who lost their liver, and to those who lost the well put together lives during the natural disasters have lost so much, we must aid them. If you can open your hospital nationwide, please right now I am trying to get some rest, but I will be with you. But for in the meantime, please have a board of your family from UCI.</br></br> 

Some other various places to come out to see me so that I can diagnose the problem I have been working on medication. That help people feel better. There is that help people feel better. There is a lot of people coming in this state.</br></br> 

Please, talk to the committee for me, so that I am parole in three months and go outside. I need my own personal office to work out of and I would also need my all and is also needed my all equipment to work with. Please save my locker for now.</br></br>

I would love to work for Chowchilla, these are my ancestors and descendants from my time in America. Please allow me to get some rest. I must see what going on in the kitchen and on the campus. I am the wonder of this company.</br></br> 

I must see what's going on, why have this pandemic, and what caused this pandemic, and what caused it.</br></br>

Please my next slot is on December 28,2020. Also, I would like some artwork for next year’s New Year’s parade and any prints on artwork of roses and day of the dead special clothing that are coming out to people feel welcomed in our state. I know if we can direct them into other states, I need help.</br></br>
