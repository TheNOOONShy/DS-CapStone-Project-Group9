Hi PrisonPandemic,</br></br> 


I am currently incarcerated and have been throughout this entire pandemic. I don't know what the world looks like now, or how I will be able to re-enter that great big place that creeps closer each day. Although, watching the world through the dayroom television, only serves to increase my doubts of success once released.</br></br> 


I’ve contracted the virus more than once while incarcerated. The second occurrence I never reported to staff. These reasons vary, due mostly to the untamed leadership on how to deal with each “outbreak” I simply suffered alone and as out of reach as possible. Since my arrival into CDCR I’ve been diagnosed with HIV. This new information had dealt a blow that still invokes tears, sadness, fear, and abandonment.</br></br>  


I have been sexually active with just one person over the previous years. Someone I loved dearly. As fate would have it, I now share something chronic. It could’ve been avoided if the one who knew would have told me. I would’ve still loved her as much, even more perhaps, but it seems that she has disappeared into the night. I’m left with a tremendous emotional burden, along with a diagnosis I still don’t fully understand how to live with.</br></br> 


As for being incarcerated with this illness; well, others, for lack of knowledge, replaced with ignorance. Some seek to destroy people like me. So, I keep silent and avoid any possibility they could find out. Loneliness: I feel so alone, ashamed of myself for being so naive I am not very close with my family back home in North Carolina. They may very well never know what I have done to myself or what's been done to me. Either way, this is my new reality now.</br></br> 


Of course I'm on medication now. The information the medical staff provide goes in great detail about what my body is enduring, but nothing I've read explains what I done to deserve this. How someone could say that they love you and yet impact your life without an explanation. I’m sorry that I’ve partially went abroad here in this letter.</br></br> 


I was very surprised to receive your introduction letter. I admire your efforts in gathering information in order to help better understand this difficult occurrence and how it has changed our lives. I don’t receive mail very often, so you can imagine how I reacted to hear my name called (LOL). As of today, (3.14.21) I’ve received only one of the two vaccine shots. I know it’s very important so I’ll definitely be in line when the second one becomes available.</br></br>   


Now I have a question. Would it be possible for someone within your staff to link me with someone for others that can help me with what I’m going through? Believe me when I tell you how embarrassing I feel, yet somehow I think you could lead me to somewhere I desperately need to be and of course interact with adjusted, caring and friendly people.</br></br> 


I want to live! But how, it the help I need. A friend would be nice. But hey!! If you guys are super busy and perhaps this oversteps any lines, then I’ll understand. Nevertheless, thank you very much for your kindness and “I hope we all get through this challenge.</br></br>


Your friend.
