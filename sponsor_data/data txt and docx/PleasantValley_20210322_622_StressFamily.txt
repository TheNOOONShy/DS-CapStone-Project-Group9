This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Pleasant Valley.</br></br>

I haven't seen my family in over 10 years now! The only line of communication we had was through the phone and letters. I went a few months without speaking to them, and it broke my heart into million pieces.</br></br>

It's really scary when you can't know your family's status apart from feeling afraid for them. It sucks to feel lonely! Not being able to call my family and friends was depressing!</br></br>

My ex-girlfriend ended our relationship right after we stopped getting visits. She said that the lack of communication and everything that was going on was too much for her. It's really overwhelming when everything happens at once. I was losing my mind.</br></br>

I stayed up late at night, praying, and hoping for better days to come. I needed much strength and courage to face everything that was about to happen in my life. One thing that was unbearable was the feeling of being lost and alone. I needed to hear my mother's voice and siblings! That's if nothing happens to them.</br></br>

I finally decided to look at these things that were happening as a test of time. In prison there are only limited things we could do to cope with the things we are going through. Some of these things are usually bad!</br></br>

But I chose to cope with things that I was going through by turning to my higher power. I asked for serenity over the things I cannot control, and strength, courage to confront everything head on! Good or bad.</br></br>

I believe everything happens for a reason. Although, at the time, nothing seemed fair. A lot of people judge us just because we're in prison.</br></br>

They think that we don't care about anyone or anything that goes on out there in the world. That's not true! We are human beings too. We hurt as much as anyone else.</br></br>

I know, it's easy to give up when you get knocked down. But you and we have to keep getting up! Why?</br></br>

Because as long as you are alive, there's a fight still left to be fought and we can't give up! At least not that fast and easy. I believe trials and tribulations builds endurance, and endurance builds strength of character, and strength of character builds perseverance! We are all going through the same struggles and the point is to be strong and overcome it.

I wish everyone the best! Thank you for the opportunity to tell my story and especially for taking your time to read it.</br></br>

Much blessings to you all.</br></br>

Sincerely,</br></br>
