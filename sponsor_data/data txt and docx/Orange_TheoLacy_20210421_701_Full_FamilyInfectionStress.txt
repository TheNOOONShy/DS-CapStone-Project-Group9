<em>This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Orange County Theo Lacy Jail.</br></br></em>

Hello,</br></br> 

I was very surprised with this letter. Someone caring about my well being while I’m incarcerated is new. I have been in jail for a few different time in a few different states. I really wasn’t sure what to expect because of COVID-19.</br></br> 

So, first thing that happened when I got out of the patty wagon, I was sat on a bench awaiting my temperature and blood pressure. This was a the Theo Lacy facility in Orange. After my medical history was finished I was crammed in a holding cell with a lot of dirty looking guys, but most of them had masks so I felt better about being so close to them.</br></br> 

After a day and a half, I went to quarantine. We got a instant COVID-19 test then me and a man from India went to our cell. I went through terrible withdrawals from fentanyl. I was in terrible pain and I slept most of the time.</br></br>

The was medicated and treated well by the medical team. They was very professional and caring. The guards were fair and understanding in my eyes. I’m very grateful for my incarceration because it was the time I needed to reflect and obtain clean time.</br></br>

All my family is still in Ohio, so I did not get any visits which is always hard. I stayed in touch with my mother and father by telephone regularly. I miss my family very much. My step father took his own life this past Christmas so my mother is still grieving which makes it hard on me also.</br></br> 

I stay very positive although my vices brought me here. I exercise daily trying to get in prime shape for my mind and health. I do different workouts each day to target specific muscles to have an even build. I weighed 180 lbs when I was arrested January. Now it is April, I weigh 215 lbs.</br></br> 

I watch what I eat and try to manage my bread intake. My health is my main coping skill because there's so many things I can do to stay busy. I can stretch, yoga, meditate, meal plan, and exercise which I do to my best ability (besides honey buns lol).</br></br>

I’m 29 years old so I’m trying to make this my last time in jail before I turn 30. I will not go into my 30s as a drug addict or criminal. I read a lot and try to learn anything I can that will help me when I’m out and working. I came to California to stay sober, I had a slip up then ended here by God’s blessing.</br></br> 

They have been offering two vaccinations here. The two part Pfizer also the Johnson & Johnson. But the Johnson & Johnson is on hold so now they offer just Pfizer. I have not got either. I’ve noticed they make people sleep a lot and complain of a sore arm. I’m hesitant to get one because I’ve never had a flu shot and I’ve never had the flu.</br></br>

Well I hope my letter help your project.</br></br> 

Sincerely.
