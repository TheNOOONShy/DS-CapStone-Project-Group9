This story was told by a person incarcerated at LA_MensCentral.</br></br>

UCI: That’s interesting. And what, in your perspective, how would you have handled all this differently? Say, if you were the head of the prison?</br></br>

Caller: Well, it’s really simple. First off, they needed to screen the incoming, you know they had officers working in buildings that were affected and they had them come work overtime which was a possible contamination point. They had, I worked on a level one support yard, level two support yard, so a lot of inmates went outside.</br></br>

And they still had inmate workers going out there and doing slave labor and that’s how some people got infected with COVID by being forced to continue to work. But they’re just, there was such a lack of insight, such a lack of, of, of command. And every time any official like a lieutenant or a captain came in, or a sergeant, came in to speak to us, it was just all lies.</br></br>

They just needed, they needed, they’re well aware that we’ve had SARS breakout and we’ve had MRSA breakout and everything in prison. But the policies and procedures that are in place and the people that are left to manage these situations have just no clue on how to provide, they weren’t providing proper, I would’ve provided better cleaning materials.</br></br>

We know that bleach kills it. Instead, they use these PI materials that are bought and paid for by the tax and it may fight against COVID, and that’s the only chemicals that they were allowing us. But it was very limited and sparse and few in between that they weren’t giving us enough to clean the four, five times a day I would’ve.</br></br>

I would implement more cleaning procedures. The air vent that we breathe is just, if somebody was to come look and there’s two, three, four inches of dust in the environments that we’re forced to live in. And it’s just, there’s no wonder.</br></br>

I fear for the next breakout or something because a lot more people could, hundreds, probably about 250… I don’t know what the count is on prisoners but I know it’s up around 200, is just incomprehensible.</br></br>

That we were subjected to the environments that we were subjected to and not giving the social distancing space and then the moving around. I wouldn’t have done any of the moving around that they did in the crisis because the moving around, it seemed like it got people more sick, more, more agitated, more frustrated, more…</br></br>

And just better cleaning. They’re falsifying logs up there that they go through and clean five times a day, the phones weren’t being wiped down at all. And it’s like, there needs to be more oversight in situations like that to protect…</br></br>

You know, even though we’re inmates and we’re sentenced to life, we’re not sentenced, a lot of us weren’t sentenced to death sentences like those 200 inmates were. There was so much more that could’ve been done to negate and stop the spread of COVID.</br></br>

And Avenal State Prison was the worst of them all and it’s just by their policies and procedures and their lack of cleaning policies and procedures and the lack of giving us the proper cleaning tools and PPE and all that stuff. It’s just ridiculous up there. You know, you got an infected building and they were coming out and they were hugging dudes that were waiting to go to work and then those dudes came back to all the other buildings.</br></br>

You know, you had ten or 12 cats and then you had an infected building going into a chow hall where a noninfected building ate right in a chow hall that infected people ate in. If people understood the overtime that the correctional staff made. And you would look down the line and they’d be serving our trays, they wouldn’t [unintelligible] because they got to go home and take care of themselves.</br></br>

I didn’t get to finish that but as far as the reason I believe so many inmates were affected was, the correctional staff got to go home and take medicines. Us inmates were given aspirin, like here take some aspirin if you’re sick. Unless you were basically dying and couldn’t breathe, then you went and got special help.</br></br>

If the general public knew even how they handled the people that were suffering from mental illness and stuff like that, it was just pathetically sad and very, just unfathomable at how people and the inmates were treated during this pandemic inside prisons. My heart goes out to those families that had to, you know they literally charge their families to pay for the bodies and the families couldn’t even afford that in some cases, you know?</br></br>

It was just, and then the people, like I said, the three people I knew that died were all three really good people. They were getting out, they didn’t deserve to die in prison that’s for sure, that way.
