COVID has been hell on prisoners’ nerves because everyone’s worried about their loved ones' health. Things are getting a little better now with the vaccine. Guys are not as tense or irritable as before because many of our loved ones are getting their vaccines. To give you a little more insight into this anxiety I'll explain why guys worried so much.</br></br>

In the beginning of the pandemic, no one knew how lethal this virus was. Couple that with the fact that many of the prisoners on maximum security prisons (which CSP-Sacramento is) have been incarcerated for many years so our parents and/or grandparents and siblings are older and therefore vulnerable to COVID. So between ignorance and old age we were worried. To be clear, I didn’t meet anyone who was/is worried about his own health.</br></br>

We prisoners are very fatalistic and cynical and quite accustomed to the possibility of pain or death. A typical sardonic joke among our own was/is “I bet you COVID isn’t as bad as kicking” (kicking is slang for heroin withdrawal). I’d rather get COVID than kick!</br></br>

Visits have been cancelled. They are beginning to give them back to us but they are very restricted so that most guys don’t even bother. This is a real source of anger and frustration among those who got their vaccines and have family members who are also vaccinated. I don’t really get visits as most of my family died while I was in the SHU (Security Housing Unit). I can still empathize with my fellow prisoners but it's not an issue that affects me directly.</br></br>

The work assignments and self-help groups on the other hand, affect me immensely. I work in the kitchen so whenever my block is quarantined I can’t work. I got vaccinated so that I could work under any circumstances but if your block gets quarantined you can’t leave the block. This is very frustrating, but I suppose it should be expected from this monstrous bureaucracy called CDCR. Bureaucracy is the enemy of common sense.
