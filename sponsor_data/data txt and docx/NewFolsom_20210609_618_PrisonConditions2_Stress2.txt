This story was told by a person incarcerated at New Folsom.</br></br>

Caller: They're - statewide they're issuing, they're issuing out free tablets to each inmate.</br></br>

So, we'll be able to actually call or video call or send a video message or receive video message and e-mail. So, a lot of the information that you're getting will be, pretty soon you'll get e-mail. And it'll be a faster approach to getting information expressed to the world or however, you know.</br></br> 

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br> 

Caller: So, yeah, but the visits, they're shut down right now because right now we a statewide lockdown. We on a - this is called a modified program. And when you're on modified program they're not going to allow you to go and get a visit when they're searching.</br></br>

Because any time they conduct a search there's no movement. Everything's got to get searched, everybody's got to get searched, nobody moves, no transferring. None of that. Nothing. And you could probably understand why.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm. So, how long does that take? So, is it just, like, one day thing?</br></br>

Caller: That takes 14 days statewide.</br></br>

UCI: Oh, okay.</br></br>

Caller: Every prison, every prison for the last, I'd say, week and a half, we've been on lockdown. But, we come out on the weekends.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br> 

Caller: We come out Friday and Saturday on the weekends. But, that's only for the buildings that's being searched. The ones that has not been searched, they don't go outside.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm. Okay.</br></br>

Caller: Unless you in the hole, and even then, if it's your day to get searched, you don't come out – well, you do actually - actually, when you go in the hole you do go outside.</br></br>

You have to go outside so your cell can get searched. And they crack all the doors open in the area, and they crack – on every tier, every door comes open, everybody goes outside to get searched.</br></br> 

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>

Caller: So, it can be a good thing, you know. But, when you go back to your cell and you find all your stuff, you know, pictures and everything get took off the wall, and different things that, you know, they don't allow, you kind of get upset. But, you know, it's okay. You know, at least that's over with for this year.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, definitely. How have you been – oh, sorry?</br></br>

Caller: They do it once a year.</br></br>

UCI: Oh, okay. Is it at the same time every year?</br></br>

Caller: Huh?</br></br>

UCI: Is it at the same time every year or is it just some random time throughout?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, around about the spring, early summer.</br></br>

UCI: Did they still do it last year because of COVID, or did they not do it?</br></br>

Caller: They did it. They're required to do that every year.</br></br>

UCI: Oh, okay. So, how have you been coping with the crisis? I know you mentioned that you've been reading the Bible more and praying a lot more, but is there anything else that you've been able to do to help you cope?</br></br>

Caller: I exercise. And that is good. I meditate. I meditate and I do prayer and I watch TV.</br></br>

I play dominoes with my celly and, you know, I get out and use the phone. And I make sure that everything is okay with my mind, with my doctors, you know. And I just try to stay positive, you know.
