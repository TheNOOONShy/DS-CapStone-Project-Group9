This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Salinas Valley.</br></br>Dear PrisonPandemic,</br></br> Greetings from the inside to both of you and whoever eyes have the opportunity to read this. I received your message earlier and find myself intrigued by your project. So, I figured I’d clue you a timely response.</br></br> 

I was a little confused about who to address this response to as there was one name on the envelope, but the letter itself was signed by a different name. However, the writing on the envelope and inside seem to be the same.</br></br>As you can see in my confusion, I’m addressing you both. Any who, I don’t know if you saw this on the website, but I am a writer. So, if you’re looking for stories from behind the walls you picked the write name (pun intended). The questions you asked are good ones.</br></br> 

But rather than try to squeeze them all into one letter, I think it would be better to give your project a cleaner picture if I answered each with its own letter. That is if it’s acceptable to whoever form this archive you spoke of will take.</br></br>As a man who has been in jail for the past 26 years (and counting), I want to say that I truly appreciate your concerns, interest, and well wishes. We may be in the midst of a viral pandemic, but we have been in a prison pandemic in this country for almost 40 years. So, it’s nice to know the public is aware and interest in our plight.</br></br> 

So, I guess I’ll take your first question with this letter. And if you’re interested, I’ll write a subsequent letter (as I said) for the other ones.</br></br>Enclosed you will find an answer to the question of: What it has been like to be inside during this time as new as a poem I wrote explaining the same things. Hopefully together they clue you a clearer picture. I thank you for your time and interested in our plight and I look forward to hearing from you again.</br></br>Sincerely.</br></br>PS. I hope I was of some help,</br></br>Like life everywhere, life in prison has been really crazy for the past year or so. From the onset of this pandemic, based on the bubble we live in, the threat and fear of catching the virus was extremely high. Most of the men I know were glued to the news daily during the first few months.</br></br> 

Personally, I wanted to clean all the information I could so that when I wrote or talked to my family, I could pass it all on to them.</br></br>Imagine my frustration and anger when they refused to take the precautions. I provided and started catching COVID. I’m one of the fortunate ones though as all of those I loved who caught it were only able to recover. Now although they immediately shut down contact visits, other than that, at first there were little to no restrictions here.</br></br> 

But once they did put restrictions in place it was like being in a hole, only worse.</br></br>In the hole there is a 23 and one program, where a man spends 23 hours in their cage and is allowed out for an hour a day to either go to the yard, use the phone, and/or shower. But initially we weren’t even afforded that. For the first several weeks of restrictions we received no yard at all.</br></br> 

And we’d only get to shower every three or four days. Finally, after a couple of months they began showering us every other day, giving us weekly yard, and allowing us to use the phones on our shower days.</br></br>Of course, this meant spending large amounts of time in our cells. This is hard enough for the average person, during normal times, but now there was the added stress, fear, and uncertainties of a global pandemic. So, for those of us who suffer from anxiety and or depression this was extremely distressing time.</br></br> 

There were a lot of men behind the walls dealing with and trying to conceal mental health issues.</br></br>As a result, prior to the pandemic, there were mental health professionals whom we could speak with every 90 days or so. Now I can’t speak for everyone, but once the restrictions were implemented, when I needed someone to talk to most, my sessions were cut completely. Forcing me to sit in this cage and deal with the issues alone.</br></br> 

Thankfully, I had my writing to help me cope, but a lot of the other cats weren’t so lucky.</br></br>One of the few positives, at least one this yard, is that we never really had those mask wearing controversies. Maybe it was due to everyone being so glued to the news, but as soon as they issued us masks the men here were willing to wear them. Some had already fashioned makeshift masks out of cut off sweats and beanies, and were wearing them prior to the prison issuing us real ones.</br></br> 

Men might forget to put one on, but I never saw or spoke with anyone who just refused to wear one.</br></br>About two months in we began to hear reports of guards and inmates in other prisons and on other yards catching COVID, but at that point this yard was COVID free. Still, the administration wanted to clear a whole building to put people with COVID into.</br></br> 

So, they began moving people from yard to yard and building to building. Although this may have seemed like a good idea, due to COVID’s asymptomatic transmissibility, all it served to do was spread the virus.</br></br>Within 14 days people on my yard and in my building began showing COVID symptoms. As I stated, they quickly shut visiting down, which meant no one could see their families. This along with not being able to get out the cell for exercise and socialization led to a rash of cell fights and petty disputes.</br></br> 

Men who had been cellmates for months, even years, were now at each other’s threats. Prison has always been a dangerous place, but the restrictions put in place by the administration seemed to make it even more so.</br></br>As men in the same predicament took their frustrations out on one another. Eventually they started testing us and for the part the men here were eager. Though the tests were voluntary and rather painful (at first) almost everyone took them as often as they were given the chance.</br></br> 

Personally, I’ve been treated five times. Once they began testing things were eased up and we started having a regular schedule we could count on.</br></br>There was/is still a limit on the numbers of people allowed to yard, dayrooms, and work or education programs. But there was at least a schedule we could work with and to look forward to. As eager as the men were to get treated, vaccinations were another story. They began with the older more susceptible men just like out there.</br></br> 

But when they started letting anyone get the shots, it got racial. At least from what I saw, the White and Mexican inmates took the shot while the majority of the Black inmates refused to.</br></br>Being Black myself, I have to admit to being skeptical at first as well but ultimately, I took it. Not out of any overwhelming trust in the vaccine itself. But because I know that before it’s all said and done whether or not an inmate has been vaccinated will be to decide who is eligible for certain future privileges.</br></br> 

Now that the vaccinations are available our restrictions are easing a bit more. Things are still nowhere near normal, and it’s been over a year since everyone here has been able to embrace their loved ones.</br></br>But we like all of you out there have slowly gotten used to the new normal and are trying to make the most of it. It’s still a crazy and trying time, but as always life, even in prison goes on. Most of the men shy away from letting feelings be seen but all bets are off in the midst of quarantine shutdowns.</br></br> 

Forced us to face life in a new ways grappling for motivation to get out of bed each day. The walls are closing in depression on the rise. Voices of demon in my head spewing lies normally even kneeled.</br></br>I’m now forced to be rude, no hugs, no daps, I need my full six feet dude! To make matters worse at least for men like me, quarantine has cut off my limited access to family. Now only get to use the phone like maybe twice a week. Severely restrictions with whom I get to speak.</br></br> 

Holding so dear it feels unfair to choose who to afford those precious 15 minutes to. Is it moms, a daughter, cousin, nephew, or niece praying none feel my love for those has decreased. Worst of all it's no longer being able to sit face to face absorbing their love during visits.</br></br> I’m a man whose family time have always been strong. It’s from them I derive my strength to force on now more and more often. I’m feeling like a slug because of the recharge my battery. I must have their hugs added to all that is the anxiety and fear of catching COVID-19 and dying in here.</br></br> 

This environment is a literal breeding ground for any virus that happens to go be going around. Case and point every year when it comes to the flu once one person catches it everyone else does too.</br></br>With central and plus community showers and phones all it takes is one case for the unit to explode. We all know it’s not a matter of if but when, just look at what happened up in San Joaquin. Yes, the whole world is dealing with COVID-19, but this is the life in prison during quarantine.
