This story was told by a person incarcerated at Ventura County Main Jail.</br></br> 

Caller: It’s hard being in the Ventura County Jail. Especially when we’re lockdown 20 – 24 hours a day, literally. We get out for 15 minutes a day and actually, just recently, we were on lockdown for three days now with 15-minute showers for three days because there’s been a COVID outbreak.</br></br> 

And, they're saying that over 40 inmates have it. So the ones that are here, we’re kind of just stuck in a two-man cell freaking out if we’re gonna be the next to catch COVID or not.</br></br> 

UCI: And what does medical say to you during the process?</br></br>

Caller: Medical doesn’t even– they don't – we don’t really even talk to medical staff here. Only time we talk to medical staff is when they come to swab our noses and that's - but, they don't even really give us information. They just say, “Oh, if you have COVID, you’ll be notified within the hours it takes to get back from the lab.”</br></br> 

It – and they – they don’t even – they don't even let us know like who has COVID here. If it’s down our system, if it’s in our quad, if it’s in – if our neighbors have it. They don’t let us know anything so that we can take extra precautions on anything. They don't sanitize the units like they should be every day.</br></br> 

So basically the deputies, they come in they — they wear their same gloves in every unit. They don't change their gloves. They come in from the outside, wearing their boots. COVID-19 has a surfaced infection and it can be on the bottom of their shoes. It can be on their jacket sleeve.</br></br>  

Something they rub against or walk in and we’re stepping in or touching the same thing. Next thing, you know, we have COVID. They don’t - their sanitary is not high here.</br></br>
