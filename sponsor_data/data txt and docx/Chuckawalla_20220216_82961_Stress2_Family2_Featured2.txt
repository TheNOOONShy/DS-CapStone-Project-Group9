This story was told by a person incarcerated at Chuckawalla.</br></br>

Caller: And, and for us Native Americans here, we’re never heard. We’re never heard. We’re always kicking heads. "Oh, you guys just wanna, you know, do this and that." And they’re always thinking of something to block us from our spiritual rights and our spiritual rights here as Native Americans is horrible.</br></br>

It’s rough for us Native Americans. Not even on our reservation, and even in our streets, it’s rough for us, and we’re always being put down in here, you know? And it’s been really rough for my family because there’s been passing aways in our family, and I can’t practice my spiritual ways because they’re denying us our spiritual ways here. So yeah, it’s taken a big toll on my life.</br></br>

And, you know, I don’t know who’s the real criminal now, you know? I mean, I know what I’ve done, whatever I’ve done in my life to be here but to to be here, I’m already serving my time. But you treat us like we’re not human and treat us like, oh, we’re just a number. That’s inhumane.</br></br> 

How - how would that make you feel after so long? You start to hate. You start to feel not heard. And you - that turns into anger. And then, you know, then you just turn to other stuff that’s not even important. You’re not trying to fix yourself no more. You’re being humiliated, you’re being discriminated about your race, you’re being, you know?</br></br>

But CDC has a great way of covering everything up. And if you don’t do what’s right, then I don’t know. It’s horrible, but that’s my big issue here with the pandemic and what I’m going through in my own personal experience. You know, as the pandemic, it’s really been taking a toll on us.
