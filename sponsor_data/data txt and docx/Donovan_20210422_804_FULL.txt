Hello. I’m an I’m at RJD State Prison in San Diego. I just got a letter from a college student and she part of a team at UCI. She ask me to share my story and what’s happening in prison.</br></br> 

Well let my tell you all about myself. I’m a 43-year-old man and my race is Mex’s. I’ve been in prison going on 11 years and most of my time I spent it at Pelican Bay. 23-hours lockdown, but since then there was a lawsuit that was filed and the government CDC release us to do our time on the GP yards.</br></br> 

I was in the mix with the Mexican mafia but since 2018 I decided to push on back from that prison gang and give myself a chance and work on myself. The reason why I share this story with you, is so you know whatever I share with you is the truth. No lie. I’m the type of person who keeps it real and I’ll tell you the truth.</br></br> 

You see people in prison will lie and make up stories to gain your friendship.</br></br> 

The life I was involved in, we had to keep it real and lie free. I could tell stories about my old life, but them stories are war stories. Let me share with you that’s what’s happening in this prison? As of (April 12, 2021) this prison is back on the COVID-19 program.</br></br> 

Two other yards had a outbreak, it all started with the PIA facility. I do work at one of them facility it’s called Laundry PIA. The other are on a different yards. And as for COVID-19 cases there are no new cases.</br></br> 

I took both my shots and I feel healthy. I have a celly and he’s healthy as well. Everyone wears their mask and they keep all units clean. As for visits? No visits at this moment.</br></br> 

It’s been hard at times. We have our day phone calls and our mail goes out (Monday through Thursday). Everyone deals with the pandemic their own way. I keep busy and wear my mask and wash my hands every time I leave and come back to my cell. Last year I had COVID-19 and I got sick.</br></br> 

Not to bad like some people. People die from the COVID-19 close friends of mine. You see everyone story is different and mine is the way it is. I just try to be the best man I could and do what's best for myself and family.</br></br> 

No more gangs and trouble. Hopefully my story could bring light to others. I would love to share more with you. I'm a good person. Just trying to to do what's best and be the best man I could.</br></br>

Thank you for your time and God bless you and your love ones and your student.</br></br> 

Hope to hear from you soon.
