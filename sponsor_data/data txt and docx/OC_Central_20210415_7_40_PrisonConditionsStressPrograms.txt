This story was told by a person incarcerated at OCJ (Orange County Central Men's Jail).</br></br>

UCI: So how had the COVID-19 situation been at your facility?</br></br>

Caller: Honestly it just kinda shut a lot of things down you know. A lot of the programs that they normally offer aren’t really provided anymore. There is no church, none of that.</br></br>

Even now there’s like no hot meals, no visits. There’s only like one visit a month, but that is almost nothing compared to, you know, being able to get a visit Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday. So everything’s kinda running kind of slow. There is no hot meals and nothing.</br></br>

UCI: How had these programs, like is this reduced programming, or has it been eliminated in total?</br></br>

Caller: Well, as of now, it’s like the people that normally offer these programs to us aren’t allowed to come in like they used to, so even now, it’s like the programs aren’t available at all, and everything’s kinda shut down.</br></br>

UCI: Okay, and how has that affected you?</br></br>

Caller: It’s just kinda hard, you know, not being able to connect with your religion and all that, and all those other stuffs. Like, they just, kinda sucks, ’cause you’re basically stuck in your cell all day. There’s no time to really go out. And even now, like, it’s basically 21-hour lockdown so we’re in our cells 21 hours of the day, and we only get to come out for three hours.</br></br>

UCI: Okay.</br></br>

Caller: Even then it’s like we’re limited to how many people we can have in our cells, and all of that.</br></br>

UCI:  And how have you been coping with this crisis in this situation?</br></br>

Caller: I mean I just kinda try to take it day by day, you know. There’s not much that you can really do.</br></br>	

UCI: Right. So, in terms of that, what would you suggest that the facility do to help you guys, you know, to get back to programming and get all these things back up and running?</br></br>

Caller: Well, they recently started giving out the vaccine, but it’s like not everyone wants to take it, not everyone already trusts it. So, it’s kinda really limited ourselves to what we can really do, because some people aren’t really willing to take the risk and get the vaccine.</br></br>

And it’s free, too, so I don’t see why they wouldn’t, but it is what it is I guess. You know, not everyone really believes it and all that, especially with how fast the vaccine came out, and they don’t really trust the effect of it I guess.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, that is understandable. You guys aren’t the only ones that don’t believe in the vaccine. But, I don’t know if I can suggest, but I’ve already gotten the vaccine and I’m doing fine. And I think that, you know, if you want that, I think it would really help the, not only you guys, but also stop the spread.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, I know. So this vaccine situation like, has most of the people, would you say, in the facility gotten it, or most of the people have decided not to get it?</br></br>

Caller: It’s kinda like 50-50. I mean I got it myself so, I guess that’s one step forward but not everyone is willing to take that step.
