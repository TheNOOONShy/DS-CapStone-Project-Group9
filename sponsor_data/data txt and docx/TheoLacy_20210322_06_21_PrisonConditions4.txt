This story was told by a person incarcerated at Theo Lacy.</br></br>

You know, I just, I remember seeing that for the first time and it was, it was tough because I’ve been working so hard and diligently too. To become a better person and to hopefully someday return back to society. But to be labeled as nothing more than that was painful. It was painful.</br></br> 

It kind of makes you feel like, you know, it makes you wonder if there’s anything you can actually do to ever, you know, find redemption. Or to ever be able to lose that stigma that follows us and reintegrate into society. But, like I said, it’s the people out there, those that continue to fight for us and that believe in us, that also inspire us, motivate us to keep pushing through all the adversity and all the retaliation. And I think losing that fear to speak out has been empowering in itself.</br></br> 

And is giving us our humanity back. Even though it’s with absolutely no help or assistance from the Orange County’s sheriff department.</br></br> 

UCI: Absolutely. And we appreciate you sharing your story with us. And if there’s nothing else you want to share, I feel like you’ve covered every question we could have asked. I just wanted to say thank you so much again for being vulnerable enough to share your story with us.</br></br> 

And that if anything changes or any circumstances change please feel free to call us back and to tell other people as well.</br></br> 

Caller: Yeah, no thank you so much for allowing me the opportunity.</br></br>

UCI: Absolutely, yeah you have a great rest of your night. Thank you.</br></br> 

Caller: You too. Alright. Bye-bye.</br></br>

UCI: Buh-Bye.

End of recording.
