Dear PrisonPandemic,</br></br>Hmmm where to start? A gold star to PrisonPandemic for hitting a bullseye? Perhaps. As her PrisonPandemic Project form letter actually slid under the door of one of your own, a sociologist.  Not just any sociologist though.</br></br>One born a social scientist from the margins of society, who would springboard on parole through college with a FAFSA and dean's list on a Cal grant. A private grant and land a full ride. Only to become a victim to the very thing I was sent there to learn about. Who would know that the company would evict me for being a convicted felon.</br></br>While that was the very reason would admit and fund me for, a story for later though. My email used to be [redacted] and I am still alum, on a "hiatus" and I have to get a B or better two classes for two quarters, plus repay my financial debt even though I never took a dollar of student loans.</br></br>See the change was too much too fast for my family. My wife's father died and we split up. Moving from Bellflower to Irvine was just not within her scope of possibilities. "Schema" was the word I learned. So while I tried my hardest to attend school that first quarter I ended up taking all L's.</br></br>The divorce and my homelessness too big of a challenge, my addiction would win out and recidivism and statistics took me as a victim. Another story for another day. My dream is still to finish what I started. I will one day have the momentum needed to get my BA in sociology/criminology. I will find a way, and perhaps this pandemic will be the way.</br></br>You know I am only still here as I write because it takes my actual thumbprint to access my bank accounts to post my own bond. Such a silly thing that an hour with a phone and computer is all that keeps me a prisoner to the OCSD. More stories for a future date.</br></br>Before I forget, here is my info. My dad's address is my permanent mailing address, my phone number is paid until August and my girlfriend will stop at nothing to get me back. Even prostitution wouldn't be out of the question (although I openly object).</br></br>And should my booking number not show me housed at TLF, my friends and [redacted] found a way to pay my ransom to OCSD. See I was here when this whole COVID-19 (lie) began. I still think it was an answer to so many people's prayers (an act of God?) as the doors here at TLF would spit out so many people in January-April 2020.</br></br>I was then 11 months into a "no bail hold" due to the OC probation refusing to allow me to separate my PV from my new charges. On probation, you're guilty until you plead guilty again. But due to COVID-19, the courts could no longer keep their end of Constitutional rights. Quick and speedy trials as well as preliminary hearings went out the door.</br></br>Most people I know were sent home on zero bail or my own became $70,000 which I gave $700 to a corrupt bondsman to buy my freedom. I personally grievance the sheriff's deputies going home daily, the housing of people from the streets. Plotting my life at risk, to which I never received answers, I was here when the "hot meals" were taken away. Now its bologna sandwiches three times daily, no hots!</br></br>And I spent 13 months on the "frontline" with criminals, prostitutes, and addicts in motels and various other non-permanent housing. I was out to get my stimulus and PUA monies. To see the rampant around.</br></br>I have spoken with a youth in Ghana who (like myself) has never witnesses a single case of COVID-19 and says the politicians kept the international aid and made every death a COVID-19 death.</br></br>Seriously, in 13 months I have never met one person who had COVID so what exactly is in a vaccine for a virus that doesn't exist? Who knows. But nobody in here or out there I know will take it. We think it is the virus people who do take it get sick, real sick. And the protocol in place seems more for a radioactive type of situation from a viral one.</br></br>Why wasn't the Beirut explosion last August on mainstream TV even Trump saying they were bombed. Looked like a tactical nuke to me, might COVID-19 be fallout control in disguise? Would you tell the world if nukes got used? Probably not.</br></br>While I might sound borderline sane at this point I encourage you to checkout my transcripts, ask my professors if they remember me. The student who did 10 years in prison "main line" and then got straight A's. I asked on my application the value to any social scientist what participant observation on my level would be worth? I was flooded in funding as an answer.</br></br>Then I fell through the cracks only to land at the heart of the new problem. When I was upstate at CDCR in Norco during Proposition 57 I reached out (via mail) it's been five years of living in the 8 percent of us who'll never "age out" in those societal margins.</br></br>But know that my dreams of publication (my doctoral thesis would be the effects of Bitcoin on Capitalism taking the black out of the black market) won't ever die. And now as my golf penal grows dull(er) and I wrap this up to send out this message in a bottle, I hope it is scanned and forwarded, placed in my file.</br></br>Zot zot zot I could use a hand here, but I have 10,000 stories to tell and answers you will never get elsewhere. Also, my charges are all blown out of proportion. Any real lawyer even an undergrad on campus could tell you the same, but public defenders will defend the public (not my freedom).</br></br>Anyway, thanks for the letter I hope to come back soon to finish my degree to make my dream real and to write the truth so the lies can be put down like three buildings with two planes and the project for a new American century.</br></br>Yours truly.
