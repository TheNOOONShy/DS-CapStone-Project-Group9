UCI: How have you been coping with all this going on?</br></br>

Caller: How have I been coping with it? It’s kind of just – kind of just make the best of it. I just read and write letters. Sometimes I write to mental health, sometimes I talk to them but it’s kind of hard to talk to them sometimes. I just kind of happen to tough it out, suck it up, and just deal with the punches that have been thrown at me.</br></br>

UCI: What do you think would have made the situation at your facility better?</br></br>

Caller: Well, I heard that a lot of other county jails are getting tablets or they get to have tablets during free time hours. They get to talk to family or they get them from a certain period of time like from 8:00 to 5:00 p.m. That would’ve helped a lot. ‘Cause with COVID and everything, some people have family members who have immune deficit issues or they’re older.</br></br> 

Like, I can’t even see my grandma from here. I feel like it would have made it better if they could give us tablets or figure out a way for us to either get more time to communicate with our family or – yeah, all I can think of is probably tablets.</br></br>

UCI: Well, what else – go ahead.</br></br>

Caller: Measures. Or safer measures like cleaning the visitation rooms and cleaning up where they come up at and stuff like that.
