This story was told by a person incarcerated at Chuckawalla.</br></br>

UCI: Would you start out by telling me what facility you're housed in?</br></br>Caller: I'm at Chuckawalla Valley State Prison.</br></br>UCI: Oh, okay. Cool. What's the situation there right now with COVID-19?</br></br>Caller: Well, they got this building on quarantine right now. And, you know, they call themselves taking precautionary measures, you know, all of a sudden. You know, and they try to make themselves look good. However, when all this stuff happened way back in March, you know, they had moved a bunch of people from different yards to this building in particular.</br></br>And this yard in particular. And funnel them in, you know, little by little. And the guys that came over here already told us that they were already exposed to the COVID-19. Now shortly after, you know, they did this they started moving all these guys out. You know, and I had tested positive on May 9th, 2020. Yeah. And filed a grievance about it.</br></br>And they had responded in a way to where they tried to make it sound like it was my fault that I caught the COVID virus. And I had the chance to, you know, report any symptoms like on May 9th, 2020 when my test was never even happening. Because they said, they actually said that I was tested like on May 9th, 2020.</br></br>You know, no, it was May 5th, excuse me. It was May 5th, 2020. Somewhere early in May. But the test never happened. And I had pointed that out in the response on the grievance. And now all of a sudden headquarters is not answering anything.</br></br>UCI: To you specifically or ... Do you have any, is this sort of the case with other people that you're around? Has anyone else experienced this?</br></br>Caller: No. No, I'm actually filing something on my own to, you know, they don't allow us to file group appeals anymore. So, basically what they did was when I sent it out, sent the grievance out at the headquarters level, the response, they flagging the mail and they not letting the mail get out. But at the same time, you know, I still have the tracking number to the grievance when I initially filed it on June 19th.</br></br>But at the same time though, I believe that they're actually flagging my mail and certain mail that they're flagging that's confidential, they're withholding it so it won't get to the destination. So, they can, you know, conceal guilt and liability.</br></br>Yeah. But this is the culture of CDC. This is what they've been doing. I got 26 years in. You know. From the time that I was a kid when I first came in here in 1998.</br></br>I've seen them, I've seen the good, the bad, and the ugly. But I've seen more ugly than anything with them. And, you know, they're one of the organizations that commit more crimes than anybody else in the system. You know, they do more wrong than we do and then they try to lie to the public and say that it's us that's bad. But if you do a consensus and see how many times they've been, you know, convicted, and fired, and walked off for misconduct and illegal activities, you'd be shocked.</br></br>UCI: So, I want to ask a question about something you said. You said - have you been down for 26 years or is that your sentence?</br></br>Caller: I've been locked up for 26 years. My sentence, I have a life sentence. But I've been incarcerated for 26 years. You know, I've been incarcerated since I was 19 years old.</br></br>UCI: So, you've been there for a while. You've probably never experienced anything like this before, huh?</br></br>Caller: No. I've never. I've seen them do some real wicked stuff in my time. But, you know, something like this, you know, I think it's mostly acts of desperation. You know, to make themselves still look upstanding. But, you know, when all this stuff happened, you know, I watched. And just watch around and see how they, you know, kind of like made fun of the situation.</br></br>Made light of the situation, you know, like it was something to be taken lightly. But, you know, I knew it was serious because anything that's got so many deaths, you know, I know it's something serious, you know, because I grew up seeing death my whole life.</br></br>UCI: Yeah. Is there anything that you think, you know, they did right regarding the pandemic?</br></br>Caller: What do you mean? Anything they can say? No.</br></br>UCI: Or is there any, no, okay.</br></br>Caller: I mean the thing about it is, I mean how can you try to fix something that's already broken? The damage is already done. So, and, there is no possible way you can just fix this unless, you know, they start administering the vaccines and things like that. But I've already tested positive, and I didn't show any symptoms because I keep myself healthy enough to where, you know, but I've seen how it affected other people.</br></br>UCI: Were a lot of people in your yard infected when they sent those people over?</br></br>Caller: Well, when they did those mass move, and moved all those individuals from the different yards, everybody in my building had tested positive except 12 people.</br></br>UCI: Wow. How many people is that?</br></br>Caller: You were saying?</br></br>UCI: I'm sorry. Yeah, how many people was that? You were saying everyone but 12?</br></br>Caller: Yeah, it was like, it had to be at least 170 people in the building.</br></br>UCI: Oh my God.</br></br>Caller: And only 12 tested negative for the virus.</br></br>UCI: Wow. So, I'm assuming - so, you were asymptomatic, but it sounds like probably not everyone was lucky, huh?</br></br>Caller: Yeah, I guess so. I mean, you know, only thing I can do is thank God for that one.</br></br>UCI: Right, yeah. How are you feeling today as a result? Any changes for you?</br></br>Caller: I mean, you know, it's shocking because, you know, you would think that, you know, law enforcement agencies would try to prevent things like this from happening. But, you know, like it just goes on to say that I always hate being right about what they do in here. You know, and I always try to - even with them, I try to see the good in them. But they always end up disappointing me some type of way, you know what I mean?</br></br>And, you know, I don't go around, I've never been the one to been assaultive towards them or wish any ill will on them. But it always seems like they wish ill will on us for no reason. You know, we've already been punished. So, why are you trying to punish us even more?</br></br>UCI: Right, yeah. Do you feel like the way that they're handling COVID is sort of like an additional punishment then? Is that what I'm understanding?</br></br>Caller: Well, I mean it seems like it because I mean it's like if you're damned if you don't, damned if you do.</br></br>If you speak on it, they'll find a way to retaliate, you know what I mean? But the thing about it is now they find another way to try to, you know, implement they little rules to try to have control and things like that. You know, how can you try to implement a bunch of rules to have the control when you have a bunch of inmates on a minimum security yard that just all we want to do is program and possibly go home one day.</br></br>UCI: Right, right.</br></br>Caller: So, this is why we were sent here.</br></br>I came here to possibly, you know, get this sentence reduced based on good behavior and go home one day. But at the same time, you know, proverbially I always feel like it's a foot being put on my neck for no apparent reason.</br></br>UCI: Yeah, I can't imagine. If you don't mind, would it be possible for you to kind of give me like a breakdown sort of like month to month to see how the situation has progressed at your facility?</br></br>Caller: Well, you know, it seems like now every week we're getting put on quarantine. You know, now that the wardens in Sacramento have finally just stepped up and, you know, took reins of the situation, it seems like now every month is a quarantine. You know, now they're testing more. You know, and, you know, since some higher ups pretty much got, you know, got on them about doing what they're supposed to be doing, now they trying to play ten-hut-one-two right now.</br></br>You know, but back then, you know, they were just trying to move everybody from different yards and different institutions and everything. You know, so now all of a sudden when you got Sacramento involved, now everybody has to, you know, toe the line.</br></br>UCI: I see. So, it's like what you were saying earlier about how they're kind of just doing it to look good or whatever?</br></br>Caller: Yes, yes. I mean but when you making a lot of money like this and you know your job could potentially be on the line for you not doing your job.</br></br>When your bosses step up, guess what you going to do? You're going to make it look like you're doing your job.</br></br>UCI:	Yeah, yeah. That makes sense.</br></br>Caller:	Yeah, you know, I'm a realist. I've seen it over and over again.</br></br>UCI: I appreciate you being real. Can I ask how this has affected you - I've heard some people report that like they've been unable to, you know, see their loved ones or your visitation's been affected. Can you describe that for me at all?</br></br>Caller: Well, everything, everything - I'm trying to get a transfer back so I can get closer to my family and friends up north in Northern California. You know, I need to get closer to my brother and everything. My mother died last year November 28th. And, you know, the best part about is I've got in touch with my other side of the family. But, you know, at the same time though, I'm not even from Southern California.</br></br>But they got me all the way down here stranded away from my family and friends. And I don't know what could potentially happen. So, it has an affect on my psyche, you know, because they've been doing this, you know, practically my whole commitment. Trying to keep me away from my family. So ... And I finally got to an institution based on good behavior, and it seems like it's happening all over again.</br></br>UCI: You're in like a lower-level security facility now? I'm not familiar with the one you're in.</br></br>Caller: Yeah. Yeah, I was in the maximum security for the last 20 years before I ended up going to a level three, which is medium security. Then I did two years clean on a medium security, then they sent me all the way down here to this minimum security when I actually requested to go to a minimum security in Stockton where my brother lives. But they never honored that. And I was a programmer and everything.</br></br>UCI: Sounds like you're sort of under, well obviously, under more stress than normal. How are you dealing with that? Like how are you coping?</br></br>Caller:	Yeah, I'm coping because I understand that it's all a game anyway because, you know, I'm not going to sit here and put on an image like I was, you know, a nice guy or anything like that. You know, I'm, you know, you know, there was a time where I messed up. I used to ...</br></br>Caller: But now since I've gotten older, you know, I changed. So, here it is, the game begins to see if I really changed. You know, so I mean the only person that can mess this up is me and I know that.</br></br>UCI: Yeah, well I really appreciate you calling. With the time that's left on the call, is there anything else that you want people to know about what's going on inside?</br></br>Caller: Yeah, everything you hear, everything the CDC, you know, says that's true might not be true.</br></br>So, you know, I would like the public to know that.</br></br>UCI: All right. Thanks so much. I really appreciate you coming. You know, if anyone else has stories, make sure to tell them to call, okay?</br></br>Caller: Okay, all right.</br></br>UCI: Yeah, have a great night.</br></br>Caller: Have a good one.</br></br>UCI: Yeah, thank you. You too. All right.
