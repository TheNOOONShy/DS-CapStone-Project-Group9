This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Tracy.</br></br>Greetings,</br></br> As you know and are acutely aware, the COVID-19 crisis in California’s carceral facilities remains a pandemic inside a pandemic. Particularly, because of the correctional staff’s disdain for the inmates push to a better public health crisis. And especially during the exact same time as the racial justice crisis that remains a integral part of America’s community crisis where each day, week, month, and for year some minority (like a Black man) is being killed by unscrupulous policies.</br></br> This same occurrence has plagued the Black community during the 60s, 70s, 80s, 90s and this entire millennium. The Black communities have been locked down during this same period and perpetuated with the War on Drugs, which allowed mass incarceration. Take, for example, the fact that the three-strikes law allowed courts to give, for example, me six years to life for taking the screen off of a window while the occupant was home.</br></br>
 Although no encounter ensued, the occupant may or may not been in fear of imminent danger. I was only fleeing from gang members who tried to force me to steal an air conditioner from Home Depot’s sidewalk sale. Please know that although my crime was fueled by my crack cocaine addiction, I fully accept responsibility for my inappropriate and unacceptable behavior.</br></br>
 COVID-19 is and will remain the catch phrase for all pandemics. The perpetuation has just been gradual. Now, however, I come from the position of how it impacted prison as a whole. The staff here - which are 80% Hispanic, 15% White, 3% Black, and 2% Asian - is running a system that’s 60% Black, 30% Hispanic, and .07% other and 6% White.</br></br> These disproportionate general numbers are reflective of the pandemic's effects on the minority population and the prison and courts targeting poor Blacks and minorities. Couple this with the inner working of the staff’s disdain for the Black inmates, along with inadequate cleaning supplies, PPEs, and packing inmates up like sardines makes it next to difficult to practice any type of social distancing.</br></br>
 What it’s been like to be inside during this time is extremely hard to articulate. Because it’s like a parallel universe where we are told one thing, but the staff are fighting against the administrator’s decision-making process.</br></br>
 How I feel about my safety during this time is intense by all these external factors, like cleaning supplies, PPEs, non-existent social distancing, Hispanic staff blatant disregard for Black inmates. My safety is so imperative that the more I project the concern, the more staff becomes dismissive of any effort to practice social distancing policies.</br></br>
The facts surrounding the visits are understandable, but the administration should come out of the dark ages and get into the technological ages and implement a system where every inmate could have  cell phone or tablets that allows for social media that permeates society.</br></br>The way I’ve been coping with the crisis is by praying, meditating on the words of the Bible. Journaling, attending services, and exercising along with watching sports. My days are dark because I don’t have a significant other to vent to. Nor can I be the sounding board for what God is doing in this wicked and perverse generation.</br></br>
 I remain continuously optimistic.
