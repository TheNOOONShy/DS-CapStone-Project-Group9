UCI: What has the COVID situation been like at your facility?</br></br>


Caller: It has been unpleasant to say the least. It’s been a lot more them controlling us and telling us what to do and not being able to see how our loved ones are doing because of phone calls. No visitation, it’s just been very rough. I mean, no one ever thinks that there’d be a pandemic and now that it’s actually happening to us and it’s like being locked up twice. It’s awful. It’s bad.</br></br>


UCI: How has the COVID situation at your facility affected your loved ones?</br></br>

Caller: What was that, like how it affects my loved ones?</br></br>


UCI: Yeah like well it could be either them or like visitation. Anything that's changed.</br></br>


Caller: Yeah I mean, as far as that goes, I’m an inmate with few resources so I haven’t seen my family since 2019 because of COVID. Unfortunately my father caught COVID and he almost died. He caught COVID and because of COVID he almost like, he caught pneumonia at the same time and that almost killed him. I thought I was never going to get to see my father again due to COVID and the way things went down here.</br></br>


We’re not allowed to have visitation and you know they lock us down because an inmate tests positive for COVID so we’re not able to use the phone and the mail is slow. So I haven’t seen my family since 2019 and it’s affected us really really bad. I even was in a relationship with somebody and because of COVID I’m no longer in a relationship because the distance between us broke us apart and now it’s just a tragedy that happened to me, you know?</br></br>


UCI: How have you been coping with everything?</br></br>


Caller: I mean it’s difficult, I personally spent almost 20 years incarcerated so you just have to cope, you have no other choice. You have to deal with it within yourself. You bottle up your emotions and just do what you have to. There is no really anybody else you can share your emotions with. Everybody’s going through the same thing and doing that in here isn’t looked upon too well, you know? So it’s just you struggle with it. You don’t know what to do, what to say, how to help your loved ones because you're trapped.</br></br>


And to recieve help as well cause’ unfortunately my environment being in a maximum security prison is just like, they treat you like crap. You’re just an inmate, you’re just a number, you know? So, coping with it lately is hard and I guess as far as the reason I’m feeling now is because venting or just expressing what I’m feeling now has kind of helped. My story can help somebody else to deal with their tough time. Man that would be a good thing I can do.</br></br>


UCI: What do you think would have made your situation at your facility better?</br></br>


Caller: Definitely them considering more visitation, a way to visit with our family members, ways to contact our family members, and many really not making it a California wide thing. Chino state prison has three positive inmates but we have none here so why should their status affect our status? Our status at this prison right now is zero COVID, as far as my yard that I’m on there’s zero COVID positives. There’s nothing yet we still have to suffer the consequences of the other yards and the things that they go through.</br></br>


They need to help us talk to our families more. Whenever we are able to call home it’s every two, three months. Lately it’s been okay but by the time we call home it’s like, “Hey, what’s his name did or what’s his name died.” And it’s like what, what’s going on just because we don’t have opportunities to call our loved ones and stuff like that. So, they need to help us reach and be with our loved ones a lot faster that the way they’re doing it now.</br></br>


UCI: How has the vaccination situation been like at your facility?</br></br>


Caller: So far so good. I mean I’ve personally been vaccinated already. I got the two shots they gave me the moderna shot and I got both of them. A lot of inmates are refusing just because they don’t trust the system or the way things go. I got it, it’s pretty much been rolling, they’re doing it. They’re trying to get everyone vaccinated so we can stop this disease, this virus.</br></br>
