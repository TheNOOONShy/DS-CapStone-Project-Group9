This story was told by a person incarcerated at Chuckwalla.</br></br>

UCI: And what is the current COVID-19 situation at your facility?</br></br>

Caller: Well, I already went through the symptoms and all. Really, the treatment of the medical in the facility, how, you know, they mistreat us, and actually it's like a, it's not a, how would I say, an observation unit. It's actually worse than being in the ad-seg unit.</br></br>

UCI: Okay. Okay. What is troubling or concerning to you?</br></br>

Caller: It’s really the lack of the medical treatment in the facility and the constant change of medical nursing. I’m saying that they're actually bringing in new newcomers that actually don’t even know what’s going on and how to treat us and everything during this pandemic.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm. How was the COVID-19 situation handled at your facility at the beginning of the outbreak?</br></br>

Caller: They constantly, they constantly moved us around. Once you’re tested positive, they move you from one unit to another unit, and then another unit, and it’s like you don’t feel the symptoms until they put you actually in one whole unit with the rest of the people.</br></br> 

And that’s when you start feeling all the symptoms, and you’re around a lot of people and the, how would I say, the social distancing, you’re sleeping right next to a person two feet away from you.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: So, there’s really no, there’s really no separation in, in this housing unit, and it’s just a housing unit, not a cell, not a cell. There's dorm living, not cell living.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>

Caller: So you got eight people to a cube, and like I said, you’re like two feet away from each other. You know, they - all they just want to provide you is really like Tylenol or some kind of cough suppressants or something like that, but really there’s nothing else they do for you.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm. Is the situation being handled differently now?</br></br>

Caller: No, it continues the same, it continues the same. Once, once the turnover of the unit, once one building is infected, they move all that building to another building, and it just goes back and forth. It just goes back and forth, back and forth, back and forth from different buildings.</br></br>

UCI: UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>

Caller: So actually, it's just a turn around like if a medical is infecting you on their own. My building can go in there and be removed within the 14-day period, and another building goes in there, and they're in there for a 14-day period, and it just constantly coming from other yards, other facilities. There’s only one housing unit being used for the observation of COVID.</br></br> 

UCI: UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>

Caller: But every facility uses that same housing unit.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah. Okay, and what do you think would make the situation at your facility better?</br></br>

Caller: If public health departments were to come in and overlook how medical is doing.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm. Okay, and how has the COVID-19 situation at your facility, affected your loved ones?</br></br>

Caller: Well, because of the fact that there’s no visiting and so on like that, yeah, it’s been going on a year already or nine months or so, and they’re just about now starting to put in the Skype plans. They’re barely installing the Skype, you know, for family viewings.</br></br>

UCI: Oh, okay.</br></br>

Caller: Through the Skype, you know?</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm. So, what has it been like for you to have reduced visitation and programming?</br></br>

Caller: It’s terrible. It’s terrible. The programming is really off. There’s a limited yard, limited out programs, and you know, it’s just like I said. I personally don’t feel that it’s prison. I personally feel it’s a concentration camp kind of situation.</br></br>

UCI: Okay. So, what have you been doing to be, to cope with the crisis?</br></br> 

Caller: Just following the masks, and the social distancing and constant washing of hands and eliminating myself to being in contact with others.</br></br>

UCI: And, what else do you want people to know about your experience?</br></br>

Caller: I honestly feel that CDC, CDCR should actually be written up through the, you know, the state and county health departments individually on how they’re treating the COVID epidemic and what measurements they need to take for, for fighting, you know, this virus and what are the next steps on, for the vaccines.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm. And I know that you said you had gone through some of the symptoms. So I’m done with all my questions. So if you wanted to talk about that or anything else, the rest of it you, it's your time.</br></br>

Caller: Okay. Well, I guess I pretty much gave you all the information.</br></br> 

But like I said, I really feel that, you know, there needs to be - I feel the medical staff here actually needs to be trained from health department staff on how to treat the COVID, not just by guessing game of issuing certain medications and moving prisoners around from one housing unit to another housing unit just so they could - I kind of feel they’re being in the interest of some type of financial funding for treating us for COVID epidemic.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>

I think they should actually, you know, certain facilities individually should be overlooked by professionals and other people who can really show and teach medical what needs to be done here.</br></br>

UCI: Right.
