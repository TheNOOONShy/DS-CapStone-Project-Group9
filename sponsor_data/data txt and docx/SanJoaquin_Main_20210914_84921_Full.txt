This story was told by a person incarcerated at San Joaquin County Jail.</br></br>

UCI:I would love to hear your story.</br></br> 

Caller: Great. Great. I'd love to tell it. Okay. Yeah, first I feel a little bit more drained than I normally do today, so I apologize.</br></br>

My schedule has just worked into some crazy type of schedule being locked in here, jail, 24 hours a day to where they finally restarted – reinitiated our breakfasts, which comes at 4:00 in the morning, and normally I just toss and turn when I go to bed anyway, so I'm going to be up until 2:00, 2:30 regardless, and – so then it became a point of, like, why go to sleep for an hour just to wake up all groggy and go – go down and stumble down there for breakfast? So now I just push through, wait until break – I write all night for you guys.</br></br>

I have to say, it's inspired me. I just write all night and then until 4:00 in the morning, and then eat breakfast, and then I come back and write a little bit more, and I'm in bed by, like, 5:00, 5:30, and I sleep until 3:00. Starting to – feels like it's starting to catch up to me. I wrote 16 pages here for you guys yesterday. Probably my longest story yet, so just bear with me.</br></br>

It runs over a few different topics along the way of getting to the final point of what happened yesterday with these – these men at the table. So I'll – I guess I'll start now. Hopefully I'm not too groggy. I feel exhausted more than usual. But okay. It's called Guts and Glory. I'll start now.</br></br>

Okay. I had an experience today that felt a bit profound as once again I sat in at the table where they do their bible study every day. I enjoyed listening to these men go around the table and speak their minds on different matters in their lives as well as the reading of the daily passages from the bible itself. And before praying out, they do allow me to – a minute to read off a chapter as one of my – my many stories from my book I'm now writing.</br></br>

Well, today I decided to read off the very – the very story that I had just finished writing earlier on this day. In fact, it was the very story I had read to everybody at the University of Irvine, California earlier in the day as well titled, “The Better Part of Me”. I read it to them specifically because I felt there were some things in there that I had to get off my chest, certain details these men deserve to know about me because the story is filled with revelations in it about myself that I feel I needed to get off my chest no matter what the consequence might be or else I could be considered a hypocrite of sorts.</br></br>

I fear no consequences, but I do value my word as to being true to what I say and true to who I am, so it was time to have this discussion. But before I go any further, I'd first like to give you a little background on – about myself. I'll start by telling you how I trained in various forms of martial arts starting fist with karate and then kung fu, and eventually settling into Kuk Sool Won, a Korean form of mixed martial arts where eventually I received the privilege of lessons from the masters themselves from high atop the mountains of Korea.</br></br>

It was all very spiritual of me, and early on in my years it heavily instilled within me a level of discipline and self-worth for who I am and what I believe in that has gone unwavered allowing me to experience many things in many different ways in this life while being free from fear of failure and enabling me to take calculated risks and face many challenges head on. I would have reached the status of black belt and then soon be considered a young master myself with no more than six months or so more of training left, but my attention was then grabbed by the teachings of a friend of mine whose father had become a Buddhist as I began learning about the American history and this peace and love movement that had occurred.</br></br>

I then jumped onto the bandwagon with all the perks of that movement as I temporarily put my other disciplines and training on hold. Now fast forward seven or eight years and I had now been working as a roofing installer for about four years. It was then – it was a – it – it was the immediate week after 9/11 almost 20 years ago to the day as I am now writing this – fuck.</br></br>

Okay. I was stuck in the hospital having been throwing up every 30 minutes consecutively for over seven days now with the doctors being unable to diagnose me with anything while I believed this day – while I – while I believe to this day it was because my sickness having resulted from something I had contracted from this collection of over $5,000 worth of exotic lizards I was really into at the time. I'm sure it could have killed me, especially with me having not received any treatment other than an IV full of water and potassium.</br></br>


But being far too sick to do anything, I had eventually asked my wife at the time to bring me some marijuana to the hospital because I was in so much pain. Even the morphine they were injecting me with wouldn't put me to sleep. And really – and I really just wanted to sleep so I could take a break from all the suffering.</br></br>


So then later that evening as I was smoking a joint out the window of my – my room at the hospital, I was brought to tears in light of all that had happened a few days prior with the death of so many people. I was – I was crying for two reasons. I was crying for two reasons, with one being the obvious suffering that had just occurred and a second reason being that in this moment, I had been watching on TV this live broadcast that they were airing that was including a lot of the influential people of our times.</br></br>


It was a special that they were then airing all night long about maybe a four-hour special until – including about 30 or so celebrities and musicians that had joined together to come out to – onto the stage to express their views and their sorrows in light of what had happened. It was all – it was all very moving and deeply impactful as the whole world was watching. With musicians coming out and singing wonderful songs, and actors and politicians alike coming out and making speeches, it had moved me and inspired me in such a profound way as I had never before witnessed our nation come together as being – come together – it had moved me and inspired me in such a profound way as I had never before witnessed our nation come together as one big family like this as we all shared in this great pain.</br></br>

But at the same time, we shared this wonderful love for one another as well as for this great nation that we believed in having this fundamental core of appreciation for human rights and in freedom. It rang out across the world as our true strength as a country seemed to define who we were. As I laid there in this hospital bed just waiting for death to come and end my suffering as I could barely hold my head up while feeling so overwhelming disconnected from this life, suddenly – suddenly while being inspired by this wonderful broadcast that they were – that we were all viewing as one nation indivisible, I was instead feeling this new powerful connection to something that felt so large and happening.</br></br>

I then quickly put out my joint and leaned over to this tray of food that had been sitting there for the better part of the evening that they would always come and bring me just in case I got hungry, and stoned as I was now and perhaps having a bit of the munchies, my pain had subsided a bit, so as fast as I could with the concern that I may start puking again, I slurped up the Jell-O first and then the chicken broth immediately after.</br></br>

When I then jumped out of bed and staggered over to the – and staggered over to the bathroom rolling with me the IV water bag stand and began to clean myself up after having called for a ride to get out of there. And I left that night thanking the nurses and the doctors for keeping me alive, but it was time for me to go now.</br></br>

That evening had now altered the course of where my life was to go from there. I left there – I left there with this compelling new drive, an insatiable thirst for accomplishment of any kind. So from that moment on, my life took a new meaning. And thought I desperately wanted to join the military and head off to war, not only did I now better with the understanding that what you see isn't always what you – what is, but also I felt I was already far too well-established with my career already setting the high water mark for those around me.</br></br>

So instead, I set a new way of life for myself to the concept that – that this – if this war were to now – I'm sorry – to the concept that if this war we were now in ever again touched ground on American soil what they would soon find is that the absolute best of us remain here just waiting for trouble to arrive where as far as for some of us being the strongest and most qualified amongst us, we automatically find a way to succeed and quickly become an important and necessary part of the power structure here at home and can't – and cannot just easily abandon our posts.</br></br>

So instead, between 9/11 and my firstborn child soon to come, I then initiated a new life policy for myself with respect to all the men and women out there fighting for us that I would make it my priority to push harder and work harder than any possible person alive, mostly considering our armed forced out there in the field as well as – as well as in the bootcamps training.</br></br>

I made it my life – I made my life harder for myself at the time on purpose, then working 12 hours a day, seven days a week taking not more than five days or so off per year where every single day I had to know that I pushed so hard that I had everyone beat. I worked until my bones hurt, until my fingers bled, and then I just kept working as I never stopped. I worked so hard I would have to roll out of bed in the – every day writhing in pain, stumbling, crawl my way to the bathroom to get ready just to do it again – just to start over again.</br></br>

It eventually got to the point that if I didn't wake up in pain every day, well, then I knew something was wrong and I needed to push harder. Nothing could stop me as I rose to the top of my industry working the [later] of three men every day in a day's time as I also began to get the – paid the wages of three men – three or more men a day as a result. I was self-forged into a beast as I worked this pace for nearly 10 years straight.</br></br>

It became the only life I knew when I then also started – and when I then also started in on completing my degree in martial arts. I joined a local MMA class that soon led me to training with some of the best trainers at the American Kickboxing Academy out of San Jose or AKA for short. They are internationally well-known for housing and training the most UFC fighters out of one gym than anywhere else in the world.</br></br>

I took the cage fighting scene by storm with in – inner core strength beyond comparison and this super advanced level of discipline and know-how of all the necessary movements to achieve success in a fight with the fact that it was engrained deep into my – the structure of my physical being at such a young age. In fact, I'd go as far as – as far as to say that there's currently only maybe a handful of fighters that can even do the splits in the industry [right now], but I certainly can as it's part of who I am.</br></br>

From the strength also gained from what I put myself through out in the hot sun everyday year after year installing roofs, which charts as one of the number one hardest jobs to do, I easily rag dolled most men as they come in to take me down, picking them up over my head and throwing them across the floor clear to the other side of the cage or ring. With my knowledge of how to fight and strength to do so, I fancy myself as – as the best fighter that has ever lived.</br></br>

And my purpose for cage fighting has always been to inspire the people by presenting to them the most fierce and capable warrior that has ever or will ever live, past, present, or future fighters to come as I am the last of my kind as we now live in a world where for the most part, all that you have these days are college wrestlers that are then taught some Ju Jitsu, a one-two punch combo, and a leg kick, then being patted on the butt and told, go get'em, Tiger where as I have been cut from a very different cloth.</br></br>

I'd become really good – I had become really good friends with the previous Muay Thai instructor from AKA and made him my corner man as well as one of my employees. It's him that nicknamed me the destroyer and sometimes known as the giant slayer because sometimes I specialized in – known as the giant slayer because something I specialized in was defeating men twice my size. At 6 feet tall and ranging from 200 to 220 pounds, I'm just big enough to defeat giants if need be.</br></br>

For some reason, for me, the bigger they are, the faster I move, and the harder I punch as I seem to have this ability to upgrade my level of output to match the size of my opponent. At these local fighting events, they would like for you to self-promote and sell some tickets to help fill the seats, but I'm the kind of guy that if I'm already having all the money I need, I show up for the love of the fight even though they would pay me more if I – if I sell some tickets. I don't care.</br></br>

I've been known to show up by myself with – without even telling anyone I'm fighting that night, even being short a corner man at times because my partner is now venturing out and having become a DJ at these clubs and raves in San Francisco, and they always hold – they always had them on the same night that I'm fighting. When I show up, I show up to get down. That's it.</br></br>

I'll tell you about one of the best feelings I know. The promoters' knowledge of – the promoters know how I fight, so they always pair me up with the main event right next to the title fight or something because sometimes these events can be a snooze fest with six fights in a row being boring as the fighters only care about the win and fight to carefully and consciously as to where no one gets hurt.</br></br>

But when it comes to the way I fight, for instance, I told one of the fight promoters when I came in to jail this time around to put me on the card in late September, October, whatever it may be over here in Napa because I'm coming out of here like King Kong beating on my chest, so have Godzilla ready for me.</br></br>

And one of the two things – one of two things is going to happen. You can – you can either watch me get my head beat in in which it happens – which it happens from time to time and that is – that, too, is exciting for everyone. Or you – or you all can witness me slaying the dragon because I come to fight. I've been known to coin moves within the industry of fighting as I invent them all the time.</br></br>

I silenced an announcer once as he was doing commentary for the home viewers when they – when they said fight in the first round, he was mid-sentence still introducing the fighters when I – when while touching gloves and with my opponent throwing his first punch, I immediately spun him into a move where I circled around knocking his punch out of the way and then continued spinning around in circles, hitting him with a spinning back fist followed by a left hook punch laying him out right there leaving the commentary speechless as they – he then said, I've never seen anything like that before. He looked like a helicopter out there.</br></br>

And moments like that will stay with me forever along with the feeling of going out there all alone and it's been crickets all night, nothing exciting so far, and nobody knows me for anything, but when I get up there and slam that fight full throttle to the end, 30 seconds into the fight I look around and see everyone is on their feet trying to see over each other as to not miss any of the action with 300 or more people screaming and cheering while the night just got exciting and I give them their money's worth for nothing in return other than all the high fives and praise I get as I walk down the aisle back to the – our den in the back where I might then go up – go and throw up – where – where I might then end up throwing up for the next 30 minutes straight because I pushed so hard and while my opponent is getting loaded up into the ambulance they usually have on standby. But that's the part of – but that's the part whereas being a fan, you never get to see.</br></br>

And now there's so much more I can tell you on that topic as to why I'm not yet the world champion having first to do with my pay scale already having been much higher than most fighters as well as being too busy with managing a family and my business to commit myself to the proper daily training necessary, combined with other major illness – another major illness that almost killed me that I fought for over two and a half years that really slowed me down.</br></br>

But that's a story – that's a story for another time as I would rather now finish explaining to you what happened as I sat at this table – table of men describing to them how I had seriously violated the code that they live by.</br></br>

Now there I sat at this table full of men committed to their cause as they all follow the code of jail politics to the letter and actually take it very seriously whereas I am a man that had lived this lifetime of success and don't hold any value to their jail politics at all, nor will I ever. In the real world, I've been a boss now for over 15 years and my thoughts are if all you – if all you've ever done outside of jail is fail and live like a nobody and then you have to come to jail to puff out your chest and act like you're somebody by enforcing jail politics, well, then to me you're just a nobody squared now.</br></br>

You're a nobody personified and I don't take you seriously. As with my first time coming into this very pod unit that I'm in today where back in November I spent two months here, I ran into some trouble with the keyholder or pod boss for the lights as he kept trying to tell me what – what to do. The third time he attempted to enforce his jail politics on me, I snapped.</br></br>

I had been making late night phone calls regularly. I had done it at least ten times where with me – with me being up on the top tier, if you stay low enough to the ground, the CO down below on shift can't even see you. So when I needed to make a late night call at 1:00 or 2:00 in the morning, I would then sneak out of my cell and army crawl my way over the payphone and make some calls.</br></br>

Well, one time I got caught and then given a writeup and put on restriction as a result. And the next day, that pod boss wanted to hold a meeting with everyone out in the yard to inform me that this sort of thing could end up getting everybody to be restricted from it if they put the whole jail under lockdown because of it. But that was just his paranoia because they barely even gave me minimal restrictions and the COs weren't that mad when, in fact, some of them joked about how cool it was with me army crawling and all that. But I agreed and said I wouldn't do it again.</br></br>

So the next day I'm on the phone with one or two minutes left before the nightly lockdown trying to finish up my last thoughts when I hear him call down from below to me saying, hey, come on, hang up the phone. As I shook my head and gestured as to say one minute, well, he goes, okay, then we'll handle this in the yard tomorrow meaning he then wanted to have me beaten up the next day. Well, I slammed down the phone and called out in front of everybody saying, did you just threaten me?</br></br>

Because I'll come down – I'll come down there right now and knock your fucking teeth out. He quickly ran into his cell and closed the door and locked it behind him. The next day we held another yard meeting where it was explained to me he was a bit rattled – he was a bit rattled by me threatening him the night before. He then went on to tell me how I'd probably kick three or four of their asses at a time, but that's why he would put five or six dudes on me.</br></br>

I just laughed as I knew that with the fact that there were only 12 of us and the three biggest guys already now worked for me, that he didn't stand a chance at doing anything to me. I would easily cut my way through half his men while these other dudes on my team did the rest. Which is why he then went to – on to – to – which is why he then went on to whine about how he's in there fighting life sentence and if I did try to come and hurt him, he was prepared to just stab me.</br></br>

So I let him say his piece and told him that he had nothing to worry about, and I wouldn't hurt him, and we moved on. And later that day with the latest batch of [apple prune] not having been completed, he quickly ran straight up to me first handing me a big old goblet of drink as we all sat there and enjoyed our evening together, thus ending his official reign as pod boss and [unintelligible].</br></br>

Now then, once again bringing me back to this moment with me reading out my story in front of these men, about one or two of them – about one or two each of them from the various groups throughout the jail, all of them very committed to their cause, and I began telling them how in the past I basically jumped around from what's considered from one gang to another as well as the fact that I'm also mixed race – of mixed race now running as the strongest man with the whites, and I also eat food even if a black man touched it, I'm breaking all their rules.</br></br>

And I could see the – I could see as their eyes are growing wider and wider with every word I said, some of them having now even jumped out of their chairs and running around saying things like, oh, hell, no. Oh, hell, no. As they would then sit back down and try to explain to me all the rules I was breaking and what the consequences would now be, even though I already knew. I slowly calmed them all down little by little explaining to them it's now better for them to – to not – it's now better for them to not be hypocrites as they sit here attending to this bible study every night trying to better understand what God wants from them.</br></br>

I then went on to ask them to imagine if they're – the love of Jesus was sitting there in jail with them. Well – well, then how would they expect him to act? And would he then fall in line with all the jail politics or would he then blaze his own trail in fighting for what he knows to be true by telling them that all men are equal with love and compassion and that it's better to live in harmony with one another rather than to continue the practice of this segregation?</br></br>

Well, slowly but surely they all then stood up at the table in unison telling me how much courage it must have just taken for me to have this conversation with them and telling me that I'm a better man than they are, and with this – and with this moment forward, and especially with what I just told them all, that they would all stand together and protect me and make sure that no harm comes – ever comes my way.</br></br>

And with that, same as in a cage fight, having a superior intellect is oftentimes your best weapon in being able to sometimes see three or four moves ahead of what's to come, knowing what your opponent will do – do next before they even do; therefore, in times where it may have seemed like you just made yourself vulnerable, that you may have instead asserted a tactical calculated risk to achieve your desired outcome whereas in a – this cage – whereas in this cause – case – excuse me – whereas in this case, I wanted nothing more than to change the – these men from within, to change the course of who they are, even forcing them to feel as if they had come up with it on – the idea on their own.</br></br>

Inception works that is the best – inception – inception works the best for helping a person make changes in themselves that can then last a lifetime. Doing something like this can take a lot of courage. And when it comes to guts, well, I've got all the guts and glory. I thrive on glory. Glory is often what motivates me and also feels great to look back on. And that's the end.</br></br>

UCI:That was another amazing story. It – it does mean a lot when you call and you share these really heartfelt stories with us.</br></br>

Caller: Cool. Well, thank you. Always so great to know that you – you feel that way. I appreciate it because I do enjoy doing it and, yeah, I was just worried that I was just bending your ear endlessly and probably don't need to hear what I got to say anymore.</br></br>

UCI: No. Of course not. We love hearing your stories. We really appreciate it.</br></br>

Caller: Oh, I'm glad to hear because I – I do have a few more and I'm down to my final six – six, seven-day countdown here as my lawyer fully finally got a hold of it, but of course, and beings they confirmed that they will be opening up the courts to us as of next Monday on the [redacted], so she specifically set my – reset my court date to the [redacted] and I should be getting out of here.</br></br>

So I will spend these last few days getting some – some stories over to you, whatever I can do. And I – and I'm going around all day trying to get these other guys to call. I got a few guys in mind that will maybe start calling you by – as of tomorrow to get you some more pandemic stories and just help you out with your cause over there, which we all appreciate very much.</br></br>

UCI: Thank you so much for that.</br></br>

Caller: Yep. My pleasure. And it looks like this is about – this is about to hang up on us, so I will talk to you guys soon. Thank you. [crosstalk] –</br></br>

UCI: Thank you so much for sharing. Thank you.</br></br>

Caller: You're welcome. My pleasure. Bye-bye.</br></br>

UCI: Bye-bye.
