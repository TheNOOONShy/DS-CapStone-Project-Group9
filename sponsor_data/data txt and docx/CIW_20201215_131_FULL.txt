Dear UCI student,</br></br>  

I have been locked up in prison since 1998, serving a 19 to life sentence. I have one daughter and she is now 29 years old. When I came to prison she was so young and I could not share with her the why’s. It was hard for me to leave her! Today, I am so close to getting a date to parole and go home.</br></br> 

So every person gets older in life, we all tend to get sick in some kind of way or fashion! Some not at all! I have come down with a lot of things. Some of it is due to being in prison. I got sick from eating off dirty trays from the kitchen. I also have COPD from smoking for so many years! I have had several surgeries as well. At times of being sick, I have felt as if I was going to die because sometimes when you put in a co-pay to be seen and are sick, they sometimes do not take you seriously. I’m sure it’s because some fake it just to get out of programming!</br></br> 

Today with this COVID-19, it has been quite scary! It is a living thing and with my COPD I have a huge concern. I had a job here working in the kitchen. I worked from 5 a.m. to 9 or later! I was considered a critical worker. At that point I became very scared. I was thinking that I didn’t want to go to work, much less come out of my room. Then I prayed to God and I became at ease.</br></br>  

A week or so later, one of the cooks that came in here to work, came in infected with COVID. At that time, the inmates that worked around that stall were put on quarantine! Let me say that for the record, a lot of people were not wearing their masks properly, nor practicing social distance! You run into and bump into people all the time! I just mentioned to my boss that I was scared to be at work. Then I was told, “if I do not go to work during the pandemic, I would be written up.” I am growing more concerned as more people get COVID! Then I was put on quarantine because of my job and the staff came in with it.</br></br> 

During my quarantine, they decided to spray inside and outside of the unit for bugs with pesticides. Everybody in that unit was able to go outside, however, me and my bunkee were not. They said that because we were quarantined. I strongly said, “I can not be in here while they spray because I have COPD." Well, they didn’t care and left me in my room! As soon as I could smell the pesticides, I began coughing and choking with a thick saliva (COPD) and I had a medical emergency.</br></br> 

When I was taken out to the TTA, the nurse asked me why did they leave me in the room? I said, “I didn’t have a key to get myself out," and the staff just said, “No”! So now I get off quarantine and I am scared to go back to work. But I must go or I will get in trouble! One day at work, I ask one of the managers (a man) for a towel to clean, and in his office, he grabs me and rapes me. Then he threatened me that if I told he would hit me and I would go to jail and get a write up. It’s one thing after another at this point.</br></br> 

Not being able to have any visits and see my family was getting really hard to deal with because of the COVID, and now after all this I’ve been through, I could not see my family for support or anything, I was feeling at my lowest. I was scared to talk and say anything due to all the things happening in here! Awhile after this happened, I finally broke down crying one day when I saw my mental health doctor! My safety inside prison is not feeling very safe, In more ways than one! There is no protection or safety at all in here. This has been the worse year in prison for me.</br></br>
 
I will be glad when I get to see my family again! I have suffered too much in the past year! There should be no excuse for what has happened to me. But I am strong today because I have God in my heart and in my life. I don’t know where I would be right now without him. Thank you Jesus! Amen. I have reported what happened to me. I am not receiving any mental health or anything. I just continue to pray and stay close to God! You never know what someone is going through in here. They cannot protect me in here and I have done more than my time. I am a better and changed person! I would tell everybody that is locked up to keep God close to them at all times. It’s the only way you can make it. That goes to everybody in the world as well.</br></br> 

Amen. God bless you.
