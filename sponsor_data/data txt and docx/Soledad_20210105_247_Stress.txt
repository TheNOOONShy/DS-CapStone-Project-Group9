This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Soledad.</br></br>

The biggest impact on me was my experience at parole board. I had gone back in May of 2019, received a three year denial, the shortest allowed under Mary’s Law, and I went back to board in October of 2020 after an automatic annual review. The second panel issued a baseless and unfounded three year denial. They failed to cite any real or legitimate threat that I posed upon release, and didn’t even make a token effort to explain their denial. Seventy days later, and I have had no explanation as to why they felt it was necessary to deny me parole.</br></br> 

The Board is supposed to be looking to let people go who like me, never have been written up, never present as currently dangerous, and have viable and adequate parole plans. Yet, overall they blindly issue unwarranted denials. Their only oversight is themselves at their monthly commissioners’ meeting. It’s at that affair that the BPH commissioners blindly rubber stamp each other’s work and kowtow to the governor’s whims, overwhelmingly, if he sends a parole grant back to an en banc review.</br></br>

This is in spite of the fact that lifers have remarkably low re-offense rates, due in no small part to having the sword of Damacles’ in the form of another life sentence for any criminal conviction loom over them. The BPH has no intentions or desire to act in accordance with their job or in the best interest of incarcerated and free persons in the state of California. They are content to let perfectly suitable inmates rot in prison and be ultra-exposed to COVID-19 while sucking down six figure paychecks at the taxpayer’s expense.</br></br>

I have been moved from cell to cell, seemingly at random since the pandemic hit here in full force. In late December I got sent to a new cell, and just the other day, I got moved again. They placed me in an isolation cell with someone who also did not test positive but had possible exposure.</br></br>

That is in addition to my having to go out for vitals or showers many times a week and interact with people who either tested positive or had close contact with someone who did. Soledad has been actively shuffling inmate population since the beginning of our outbreak last October. It is only sheer dumb luck that has kept our numbers as low as they are.</br></br> 

All told, my experience of COVID-19 in prison has been that it highlights systemic failures in CDCR. I hope it can serve to get an active and forceful oversight agency in here to clean house. For too long, CDCR has been the eight hundred pound gorilla that sits wherever it so well pleases, and it answered to a paper tiger.</br></br>
