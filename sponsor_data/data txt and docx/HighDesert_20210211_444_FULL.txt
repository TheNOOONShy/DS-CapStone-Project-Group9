I will be calling soon. For now I composed this piece with COVID in mind. Feel free to request poetry, art, greeting cards.</br></br>


FORTITUDE</br></br>


From the point of labor
As neonates we rush to’rds the exit
Unaware that life might not be pleasant
But up until that point
We are from desperate</br></br>


We’re quick to think as cynics
“No matter what we’ll manage”
Up to the time we realize
The solution we had visualized is dry paint on the canvas
Suddenly becoming frantic --- off natural instinct we all panic
Then we debunk the belief… 
… The love we shared had vanished</br></br>


We are firm believers being… 
… Belief’s what keeps us going
We’re not too fond of secrets
We have this thing of always knowing</br></br>


We’re compelled to give a helping hand
To offer comfort when it’s needed
To encourage one another
When our lungs have been depleted and spirit feels defeated</br></br>


While some turn to medicine
Others count on miracles waiting to be saved 
Regardless of our choices
Of the fact that we think different
There’s nothing more empowering than knowing we are brave.</br></br>


For those of you whom have lost loved ones as a result of this pandemic, I express my deepest sincerity and urge you to stay strong, stay positive, stay grounded. You are LOVED.</br></br>


May my contributions help you in some way</br></br>








I cherish the desire you are in excellent health. First off Ii'd like to open up by saying thank you sooo very much!!! It's very generous of you and --- I’m assuming --- your colleagues to take the time to reach out. l'm so happy you wrote, it’s unusual. I thought it was a dear John letter.</br></br>


So UC Irvine…huhhh. I’m more of a UCLA type of fella. Just pulling your strings. I’m 36 now and due to new laws (e.g., Senate Bill S1437 and S1391), I should attain somewhat of my freedom this year if all goes accordingly.</br></br>


Your words are very inspiring. I do believe in me and I’ll proudly continue to. As a matter of fact, I spent over $800 of my stimulus to enroll in a paralegal correspondence program where I will earn a certificate. I’m also about to earn a certificate of “Leadership and Management.” I already earned one on “Character Development and Personal Growth.”</br></br>


As strange as it may sound, many of us also think of you all. We do feel sympathy and under the same struggle we empathize. Take care and keep alive. Feel free to reach out by way of JPay (email) or snail mail. Also, you’re more than welcome to request poetry, art, greeting cards (customized), etc.</br></br>


Cordially</br></br>


P.S. Excuse the sloppiness, this pen was acting up.
