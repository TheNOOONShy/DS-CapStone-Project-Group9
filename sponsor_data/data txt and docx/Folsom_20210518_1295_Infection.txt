This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Folsom State Prison.</br></br> 


I am a heart patient. I had an open heart surgery in [redacted] hospital. I had valves replaced. So I was trying to be cautious and not catch it. The cops here just said if we catch it and die it is just population control. Basically that we would be doing society a favor. I am still having complication from COVID. But again if i was a chicken, people would picket for me to be free range.</br></br> 


I haven't taken the vaccine due to the fact that I was having complications and was taken by ambulance to the ER and the doctor told me in the ER that since I already had covid that he didn't feel I needed the vaccine. Plus it was tested on bovene on swine and that is what my valves are. Plus if I take the vaccine here and it rejected my heart valves and it put me in cardiac arrest, these people would not save me, they would let me die. So I refuse to take the vaccine here due to my safety.</br></br> 


Well, I am going to cut this letter off, I don't want to bend your ear to much. You be good and stay safe. Go Anteaters. If you want to write to me I am here.</br></br> 


Respectfully.
