UCI: And what is the current COVID-19 situation at your facility? What is going okay?</br></br>Caller: What is it like?</br></br>UCI: Yeah.</br></br>Caller: I guess the - right now everybody's wearing a N95 mask. They're trying to do social distancing, but Avenal State Prison is one of the few prisons in California that are dorm living.</br></br>So social distancing is - is pretty impossible, you know?</br></br>UCI: What do you think is going okay at your - your facility?</br></br>Caller: They got the building separated. You only go out to yard about an hour and a half with your own building.</br></br>So you don't have contact with the - all the other buildings, which I think is okay. Makes sense.</br></br>You know some of the other buildings you have positive - positive inmates.
