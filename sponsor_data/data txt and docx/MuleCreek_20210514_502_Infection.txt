UCI: How has the vaccination situation been like at your facility?</br></br>

Caller: Oh man, we barely got vaccinated about a month ago, about a month and a half ago. They always tell us, like “You’ll get your vaccination soon,” for quite some time. And I always thought, if I understand from the news, prisons are, they’re like a priority. It didn’t seem that way. And I mean I’m not sure if that’s true if I interpreted it from the news.</br></br>

But yeah, it didn’t seem that way and it just, we all wanted the vaccination. We wanted to see something because with no the vaccination we weren’t even allowed to do, we were limited to doing, we weren’t allowed to do anything. Come out, use the phone, shower as much as we want, we’re just stuck in a cell.</br></br>

In here, we at least get the privilege to choose your celly, but here, they just always throw whoever in your cell and you’re stuck with that guy, those people despite differences or being incompatible with them. Like, not able to live comfortable, you know. But yeah, the vaccination was, it was, it came loose, it came late. They’re still doing it right now, they’re still trying to finish everyone else in here. I got mine about a month ago.
