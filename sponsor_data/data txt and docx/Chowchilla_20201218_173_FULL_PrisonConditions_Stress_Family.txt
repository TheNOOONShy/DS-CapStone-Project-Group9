To whom it may concern,</br></br>

December 2020</br></br>
 
I am so elated to be able to share my prison experience during this COVID-19 pandemic with you. I’ve been incarcerated for 14 years and this by far is the hardest time I ever had to do. My oldest daughter is having her first baby. And to be honest I’m really scared, due to the high numbers of people that are in the hospital. I know that there is a cure but when will we see the numbers decrease?</br></br>
 
I was so used to having visits with my family and friends and yes it's hard to not be able to see them like we are used too. But when will something ever give? We are always locked down. The police rarely wear their mask the right way and they are the main ones bringing it in. We’re not allowed access to going home.</br></br>
 
Even upon being released, people are scared because of the fear of dying. All we can do is try to maintain our six feet social distancing. But let's be real, how can we? When we live with seven other women in a small room. It's not the house of being safe, it's the house of getting out safe. Like I expressed earlier, I have a daughter who is expecting her first child. Who has allergic reactions to almost everything. Who has to carry a epipen everywhere she goes.</br></br>

We have our pay tablets and we can contact our family and love ones in there but face to face is what we really yearn. I on the other hand try not to worry as much. Due to the simple fact, I follow the rules to stay safe. And I’m a diabetic, I have no thyroid and my immune system is very weak. But I wash my hands accordingly. I use a face mask.</br></br>

I really wish this was over. When will it ever end?</br></br>
 
Sincerely.
