Dear UCI student,</br></br>

Thank you for your note, any mail is a kind surprise; my stories would not be anything special. I do have family that think this is a hoax played on the masses and perhaps a reset button for the new world order, aka “conspiracy theory” or a chance to cash in on using prisoners to make money. Like batteries in the matrix movie.</br></br>

I was sick, they said I was (at least). I had the “no taste or smell” symptom. I was in quarantine in a cell. Alone mostly fed in daily, in my cell on another yard a block away. People around me knew we were going to get this virus. I didn’t think I would die, and I did not. 

I never took any flu shots all the time I’ve been here. That is November 2014 to present seven years, my ancestors survived and I too as well.</br></br>

This is the most I can do for you. Great blessings be upon you and in your endeavors. Someday we shall look on the past, and feel proud that we made it through. Hope this finds you well as well.</br></br>

All yours.</br></br>

“Keep Calm Until the Virus is Gone”
