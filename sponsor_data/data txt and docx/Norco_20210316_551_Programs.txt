This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Norco.</br></br>I live in a college/honor dorm so my experience isn’t exactly representative of the majority of the population. The worst thing about the pandemic for me is that “Inside-Out” classes were suspended. However, the first “Inside-Out” B.A. program started here in the fall of 2020 and I was lucky enough to be selected.</br></br>The classes have been better than I could’ve imagined. Although there have been some technical and logistical problems along the way, we have received so much support from the professors and other staff members at the college that we have not missed a single step on our journey.</br></br>The courses have been so challenging, so insightful, and so much fun. It has really taken a lot of the sting out of this prison pandemic experience. Unfortunately, there were only 12 student applicants selected, and for different reasons that number has been whittled down to six in just six months.</br></br>When I was admitted into the college, I already had two years of community college and one year of college credits under my belt. So I’m looking forward to being the first currently incarcerated student at CRC to earn a bachelor's degree from college.</br></br>The problem is that my experience is extremely unique. What most people don’t know is that there is a new drug epidemic at CRC that is being ignored. Most of the population in prison have had nowhere to go and nothing to do the last 12 months. Many have turned to drugs to help the days go by.
