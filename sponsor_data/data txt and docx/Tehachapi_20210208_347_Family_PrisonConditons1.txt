As far as how it’s affected our loved ones, I can’t really say because I have nobody out there. But I see what it’s done to others here and it’s stressful. The program here is pretty horrible as well because this being a PPF yard we are supposed to have all day yard and dayroom with hourly unlocks but I have yet to see that. I came over here two days before my birthday in April and the program has been like this.</br></br>

On a rotational basis they were letting so many students at a time go to school but that stopped when they realized a couple of teachers tested positive. One of the requirements for my parole hearing is that I complete a vocational trade. But I’ve not even been able to sign up for one because of the restrictions. I’ve even gone so far as to write the person who makes the assignments, only to be denied.</br></br>

I don’t really know what more I can tell people about my experience because I’m sure there are plenty out there going through the same thing I am. At least out there they have a lot more options to avoid catching it but we don’t. There really isn’t any way for us to avoid it and after having it once it shows me that I’m not invincible and it scares the hell out of me.
