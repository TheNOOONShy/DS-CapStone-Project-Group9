This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Folsom.</br></br>
The big question to me is how are my medical records being put online? I maybe a prisoner but I still have rights. I guess I should be too surprised they step all over our rights here anyway. The strange thing is that the doctors here say I need a medical treatment that I signed up for months ago that hasn’t started but they can put my medical records on the internet.</br></br>
With my apologies, this letter may be kind of over the “place” ever since I had COVID it seems I can’t focus or keep things straighten out in my mind. Please be patient with me. And as for my handwriting, I’m left handed.</br></br>
I’m going to try and describe the all out failure of the COCR to protect and stop the spread of COVID-19. At the cost of millions to the tax pays. I took three COVID test, the first two were for my job and they were the three day result both negative but that was only done with small groups of people.</br></br>
And then they did a so called “rapid” test at over 300 people at a time all grabbing paper towels off the same pile standing. I’m close people from outside and each other, no room for six feet spacing, that one I got a positive. But later after being moved to live in tents in the prison yard we were told by health care people that over 60 percent of the first rapid test were false positive but we were made to live within who people had a positive.</br></br>
The person that I shared a cell with at the time never tested positive for COVID-19 and the cells in these older prisons weren’t made for two people live in. The state has a hard time with the difference between who needs to stay in prison and finish their time and those who have done their programs, did their time and have learned not to come back.</br></br>
Sorry that’s probably not what you were asking about. Might be better with a phone call and answering questions, it seems to have gotten harder for me to concentrate and articulate lately. Never have been good at spelling.</br></br>
Best wishes,</br></br>
PS Sorry about the envelope I ran out of legal ones.
