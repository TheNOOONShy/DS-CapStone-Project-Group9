This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Sonoma County Main Adult Detention Facility.</br></br>

There is no six feet social distancing markers nor is it being properly practiced. The kitchen crew doesn’t get to shower upon re-entrance into the unit, as we should be. Medical and dental compliance is a slim chance. I admitted a form on November 02, 2020 only to just barely be seen about my dental problem on November 19, 2020.</br></br>

On numerous occasions, I’ve submitted medical forms for the same problem because I was not being seen. We aren’t even certified to handle the food that's being passed to the module units. We don’t wear protective gear to prevent the capture of COVID-19.</br></br>

I personally call the kitchen “water world” due to the fact that it’s completely covered by water 90 percent of the time, making it an incubator for a virus. We return to the housing units and assigned cells covered in grime, water, and sweat. When our bodies heat up, our pores open, which in turn, let’s bacteria or viruses, like COVID-19, to possibly enter our body.</br></br>

Upon entering the facility to be booked and housed, people are given N-92 medical masks. Only for it to be taken away and given a different mask that’s a very thin cloth. Once you’re in the kitchen, you’re supposed to be given a thicker cloth mask. I’ve asked for that certain mask only to be told that they don’t have any.</br></br>

On November 11, 2020, I received that specific mask because the prior one always slid down my face, exposing me or anybody to the possibility of catching COVID-19. We deal with boiling hot water that we are harmed by if we aren’t careful. I’ve personally been burned by chemicals and the hot water.</br></br> 

My skin peeled by excessive exposure to these chemicals which prine and blister my hands.</br></br>

We encounter the staff members in the kitchen on a daily basis. Sometimes they aren’t wearing their masks properly or aren’t wearing gloves. Us kitchen workers have no knowledge of who is COVID-19 negative. One officer caught COVID-19 and had to go on a 14 day quarantine.</br></br> 

What if he brought it in?</br></br>

They don’t tell us anything because they think that us inmates aren’t a “need to know basis”. I do not want to be the one to catch or even give COVID-19. So I ask of you to help us. We still want to see and hear our families voices.</br></br> 

I hope this letter reaches you in good health and high spirits. Stay safe and stay blessed. Thank you.
