UCI: And with your experience and your perspective, how would you have managed the whole COVID situation at the facility better?</br></br>

Caller: Being in the thick of it, in the middle of it, I think, from my perspective, I would’ve had more PPE, more things upfront. When they knew it was potential that it could’ve spread it, they waited until after it spread it. So, I would’ve took an offense approach about having masks and everything before it even got spread, before doing testing regularly.</br></br>

Testing the guards and the people that come in because we know that people that’s here, we can’t, we can’t spread it unless it comes from the outside. So, I think, doing a better job of protecting those in here with testing people out there before they came in.</br></br>

Or isolating the people that worked in the facilities to set up tents or things like that or to have trailers. Have them work by the month, to live in trailers and not go home. That would’ve better situated everybody involved.
