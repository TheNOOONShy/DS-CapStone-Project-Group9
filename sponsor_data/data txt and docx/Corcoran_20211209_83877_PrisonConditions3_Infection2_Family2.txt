This story was told by a person incarcerated at Corcoran.</br></br>

UCI: No, totally. And sorry, if I’m quiet. I’m just letting you talk. I’m just - 'cause it’s when we -</br></br>

Caller: Okay. No, no, Go right ahead.</br></br>

UCI: You know, when we go over these recordings, like, it’s just- if I’m constantly interrupting you, like you know it drives it crazy. So I'm just letting you talk. I got some other questions to ask you.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, tell me.</br></br>

UCI: So what about - like so you mentioned vaccinations. Like have people been getting vaccinations at your at Corcoran?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, yeah. Definitely. They do offer vaccinations and they, and I’m glad you brought that up too, with the vaccinations, recently, just recently, I don’t know if you’re aware, but they’re actually kinda forcing it on us now. I took the vaccination even though I didn’t want to because I’ve never caught the COVID.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: I don’t know if I’m asymptom- I don’t know if I’m asymptomatic or what the deal is, but I’ve never caught it. I've never tested positive. But just recently, I’m not sure if you’re aware, and I believe it’s on the websites or what not, if you’re not vaccinated you will not be allowed to have visiting privileges period.</br></br>

Caller: And so -</br></br>

UCI: That’s crazy.</br></br>

Caller: If I wanna see my wife and my loved ones, I have to have to take this vaccination, regardless of any religious beliefs or beliefs I have. Because the few rights that I have now are infringed on if you, if you - in my opinion. And so, I recently had to take the vaccination because I’m not gonna, I’m not gonna, I’m not gonna be penalized by not being able to see my loved ones now.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, and so at your facility.</br></br>

Caller: Oh.</br></br>

UCI: Sorry, go ahead. Is there - did you wanna say more about that?</br></br>

Caller: No, no, no, no, that - no, no, yeah. Yeah, no - I was just gonna say that, as of now, now they’re even - they’ve been asking, they’ve been asking everybody to take the booster shot. Now, right now, they're going through alphabetical order from your last name and giving everybody the booster shot who took it six to eight months ago.</br></br>

UCI: Wow. That’s crazy.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, booster shots are going around right now.
