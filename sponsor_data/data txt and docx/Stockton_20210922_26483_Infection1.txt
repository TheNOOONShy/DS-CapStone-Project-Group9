This story was told by a person incarcerated at Stockton.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, well okay, I could go - I could go to the questions because what I'm trying to find out is what kind of story or, like, COVID in here, right? I've been in here, so I can just tell you a little bit, alright? And then you can maybe take that. COVID, right?</br></br>

But I have been in here, like, 27 years for a non-violent crime, right, and it was kind of terrible. You know, I got real sick, but now I'm on the rebound, but my lungs are still damaged.</br></br>

You know, I've been in here for a real petty theft crime since '94. You know, and all my family done passed away and everything, you know? It's kind of been a terrible experience for me.</br></br>

UCI: Absolutely. And so, when you've been sick, what has that been like at the facility?</br></br>

Caller: Well, there is kind of nothing they can do because just right now, we are on the halfway lockdown because they don't have no medicine or nothing. They just kind of put them in a cell, right?</br></br>

Finally, when my breathing really act up, they put me on a ventilator for a little while, right? But otherwise, no kind of, you know, no kind of support. I believe it was pretty terrible.</br></br>

You know, like, just kind of put in you a cell by yourself and, like you know, I hope you make it, you know? So, I thought it was a little barbaric, you know.</br></br>

But now that I exercise and I run. I notice that when I lay back, I get, like, this whistling in my lungs like [unintelligible]. It kind of stung me. But when I exercise, I have long wind, but when I kind of relax, it acts up a little bit. I caught it in CMC prison.</br></br>

UCI: So, you're having lingering symptoms then?</br></br>

Caller: Right, yes. Right. I can hear it in my - I can hear it in my lungs. You know? I think that's where it's acting up with me.
