This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Soledad.</br></br>

Since I don’t receive visits that part hasn’t affected me. But I do know men in here who do and it has caused them to become very lonesome for their family and loved ones. Especially, for the men who are qualified to receive family visits. That’s when a man’s wife and kids can come and spend a couple of nights under the same roof with him.</br></br> 

But it also can be his parents or siblings. Although I never experienced those days, the men that have, have been re-established broken relationships.</br></br>

So, yeah, COVID has had a tremendous effect upon me. Even to the point of having concerns pertaining my release date. See, I am scheduled to be released in June of 2022. Who’s to say this virus will be over with by then?</br></br>

That’s in the distance, the here and now is all I need to worry about. So, I wear my mask when I exit the cell. I practice social distance outside of the cell. I wash my hands often.</br></br> 

Yet, it remains in my mind that COVID-19 is lurking in the air. Like an enemy waiting to catch me slipping. My other thought is if I was to get it, what would it do to me? Some only say they lost taste and smell.</br></br> 

Some say they felt nothing, yet tested positive. While others have died.</br></br>

Imagine that phone call.</br></br>

“Sorry to inform you your husband, son, brother, dad just died from COVID-19.”</br></br>

Yeah, a scary thought, for sure.</br></br>

Let us all continue to be safe and remain vigilant.</br></br>

Sincerely.
