This story was told by a person incarcerated at New Folsom.</br></br>

UCI: Are there other inconsistencies they have within the protocol?</br></br>

Caller: Any consistency they have with it?</br></br>

UCI: Any inconsistency, sorry.</br></br>

Caller: Oh yes. Inconsistencies? Yes, totally. Actually, anytime a person tests positive within the building, you're supposed to be locked down for 14 days. And I would think that you basically only supposed to come out your cell for is for a shower.</br></br> 

But in the month of January, they had about 20 guys come up this building. In so far, for the month of February, they had about eight, and we have never been on full protocol.</br></br>

It was like when medical come on the tears or come in the section, or the COs come in the sections, they supposed to wear the medical protocol, the medical quarantine protocol gear with the medical blue gowns, and shield and all that kind of - they donâ€™t do none of that. So, and then, well, just put it this way, every protocol that they sent us paperwork on what the protocols are and everything that they sent us they violate.</br></br>

They go against everything that they're supposed to be doing only thing protocol that they really follows is wearing a mask. Other than that, no, they don't. They don't follow it.</br></br>

UCI: And do they provide masks for you?</br></br>

Caller: Yes, they do. That we do, you have to ask for it. This last time, they didn't pass none out, you have to go ask for it. And see, I got a bunch of extra ones that I keep so when stuff like this happen.</br></br>

UCI: Mmhmm.
