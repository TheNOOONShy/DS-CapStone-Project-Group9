This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Valley State.</br></br>

Are you a journalist? Because I have been praying for an investigative journalist to really get into the facts and expose the truth of this gross injustice. Strapped with the inherent anxiety of terror of being inoculated with a vaccine virus. In 2015 I was deathly sick and it could have been SARS 2-COVID.</br></br>

No test was performed in medical facilities. They had to give me shots to stop me from regurgitating and diarrhea at the same time for days in and days out. First time was for eight to ten days. After the tenth day it slowed down but I was weak. And no pedialyte was given to me to replace what I had lost.</br></br>

Note the underlined date. Now go to November 2018 from Stockton Medical Facility to Tracy ad seg medical reports. This sickness lasted 28 days- something. Only this time wrong tests were performed by medical staff and pedialyte was given to replace the loss of vitamins.</br></br>

Note: I am diabetic and a few times between 2019, 2020, and 2021, I've have gotten sick, throwing up, and diarrhea. Now for days on end I have not been told or diagnosed with a ketoacidosis or diabetic sickness. It still weakens your immune system.</br></br>

So seeing all these people to get sick with COVID-19 here at VSP and all the transfers and it is like none of these men have had any home training about covering your cough at all times, social distance, and self-quarantine when a symptom of sickness has occurred. Cough, fever, chill, aches, or even if you were exposed to a person who had become ill.</br></br>

Asymptomatic.</br></br>

The federal courts have already determined the CDCR staff are in a mass case of deliberate indifference. They don’t care!</br></br>

So the stress that causes my anxiety is the real fear of terror on getting the big C and/or its variants. And knowing how sick I have gotten before, compelled me to expose some real honest case factors about my wrongfully obtained criminal conviction. Knowing if someone would assist me from the outside. Blood evidence and DNA can verify that false allegation and perjury was used in my case to deceive the jury in making the wrong verdict.</br></br> 

If you print this on your website that is how desperate the terror of COVID is. Is to compel me to contest this conviction to get myself out of this virus toxic institutional setting. Where there is no real meaningful safeguards against COVID-19 or its variants. When a female guard has to pick a sick old man up off the toilet because he is so weak, death was surely knocking.</br></br> 

If anyone cares about this, write to [redacted].</br></br>

Why this is so important a prison pandemic is like starting a wild bush fire in a 30 mile per hour wind. It spreads like the wind.</br></br>

Since I have been vaccinated with both Moderna shots. Now it’s on the news about Moderna booster shot that is a vaccine that may ward off the variant. But the big but is in the question is when elderly high-risk medical prisoners going to receive this booster?</br></br>

I pray your followers on your website will read this and not only speak upon this to Kathleen Allison, new secretary of CDCR at cdcr.ca.gov. And bring forth headlines of protest over booster, focusing in on the deliberate indifference.
