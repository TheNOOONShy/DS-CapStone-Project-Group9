This story was told by a person incarcerated at OC Lacey. </br></br>


Caller: So, okay, so I mean, I'm alright, imma write to you guys like the full details, you know, but like a, like a brief little real quick um- So I like I said, I got busted three months before all that happened, right. And like, when they hit the Orange County jail, like it kind of like hit here before it even hit- hit like anybody like that I knew out there, you know? </br></br>


Like, none of my family had it, none of like, like, nobody that I was busted with their family had it like, the Orange County jail was one of like, the first spots that it came to you know. And just my luck, where I was at- where I was housed at the time, I’m not housed there no more, but where I was housed at, it was called b21, right? It was like a tank, like a 60 minute tank. </br></br>


And that's exactly where the guy that that contaminated the whole jail, that's where he landed, you know. I was one of the first ones to actually get it, like in the jail cuz he was in my tank, you know. So, like, from where I was at, that's where it just infected everybody, that's where it went from, like, it started there. And then it just went everywhere to like, the whole jail, you know. </br></br>


UCI: Mhmm. </br></br>


Caller: But, um, so when they did- when that happened, that guy went home, he was only here, like, for a short time, you know, for a short period of time, he went home right away. And then he infected all of us, you know, and then people started getting high fevers and, and, you know, sore throats and like, like COVID symptoms, you know, and like, they cops started coming in with like, they looked like astronauts, when they would come in, you know, like, they'll do count, but they'll be like, all suited, all face masked, and they weren't even telling us nothing. </br></br>


They weren’t telling us shit. And we’ll ask and they'll be like, I don't know if they were told not to tell us or what, you know, but that's what it seemed like, you know. </br></br>


And then after that, what happened? After that is [unintelligible] they transferred all of us out of there. They put us in a in a cell, not by ourselves, but like with another like a two man cell. And we went through the quarantine process right there. But I've been I've been on quarantine like, three times- three, four times since I've been down here. Just because like, you know, people keep getting exposed and, you know- and so forth.  </br></br>


UCI: Mhmm. </br></br>


Caller: How long it's been, it's been like a year and a half, right? </br></br>


UCI: Yeah. </br></br>


Caller: March, February?</br></br>


UCI: Yeah.</br></br>


Caller: So yeah, like this recently, like, it’s starting to get better now though. Like, cuz it’s getting better out there, it gets better in here too you know. </br></br>


UCI: Mhmm. </br></br>


Caller: They still haven’t brought the hot meals, but I heard- I mean, we've been hearing it's on the way, but we still haven't got it, but we're like getting out on quarantine, like getting exposed. Like it's getting a lot better, you know, ever since they started the vaccine.
