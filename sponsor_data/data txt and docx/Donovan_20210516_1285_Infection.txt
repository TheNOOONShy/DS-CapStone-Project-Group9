But that all changed when R.J.D. and CDCR started housing known positive COVID-19 inmates in my housing unit [redacted]! And it only took about 10 days for my building to become COVID-19 positive. All but four people.</br></br>

We all weathered through it for what I believe was 60 days of isolation. It is very unfortunate that three people died! R.J.D was a lot more reckless when it came to disinfecting common areas and enforcing face mask wearing. It is a fact that in a lawsuit that is against CDCR called Armstrong R.J.D. and any other CDCR prison wasn’t by a court order to house known COVID-19 positive inmates with those of us that have disabilities.</br></br>

My building is a mental health building which is recognized by the courts as a disability. Plus there is also those of us who have physical disabilities: asthma, HIV, other breathing problems, COPD and physical handicaps and most of [redacted] section the cells are set up for wheel chair housing.</br></br>

I myself only have asthma, but getting the COVID-19 I was lucky enough to only be asymptomatic. In fact I didn’t even know I had it until I was tested, and all this Armstrong court order and the housing of sick inmates with nonsick ones was all knowledge and insight I later found out.</br></br>

Was I scared? Well no, but I was upset that R.J.D. didn’t care enough to not have us all the way they did and have such a callous disregard for our lives! </br></br>
