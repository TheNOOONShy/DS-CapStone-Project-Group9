This story was told by a person incarcerated at Washington State Stafford Creek.</br></br>


UCI: Uh huh. So, how have you been coping with the pandemic? And like what have you been doing to cope?</br></br>


Caller: Well, I just-. I do a lot of bead work. I do handcrafted bead work and that was something else I wanted to ask about, too because it said something about artwork in the ad that I was seeing. Yeah, I've been doing deed work for about 24 years now and I've got a display in a major mall right now I've had my stuff in an art gallery and the funds that I make from that go into savings that I'm saving out there for my release, you know? So, I at least have something to try to get on my feet with when I get out.</br></br>


UCI: Mhm.</br></br>


Caller: So, I'd just focus on that, you know? I don't even really pay much attention-. I've gotten numb to prison, I've been locked up so long, you know? This place that I'm in now is [redacted]. I mean I'm in a minimum security and I'm grateful because it is so laid back and mellow. I did-. I was in [redacted] for over a decade and that place is so violent I mean it just desensitizes you. So, I just-. I've always been alone and I just keep to myself, mind my own business.</br></br>


UCI: Mhm. So, what do you think could have made the situation better for you and your loved ones?</br></br>


Caller: Well, I don't-. I honestly don't know. I mean like we have JPay up here. I don't know what system they have down-. Because I know you guys used to have JPay down in California but I think they just went to GTL. But, the Washington DOC, in conjunction with JPay, has been offering two free video visits for every person that's on your visit list per week and then discount games, and on Wednesdays if someone sends you a message you get a free reply stamp.</br></br>


So, I mean, they've made an effort to try to allow us to have better communications with our loved ones through all this, so I can't completely knock them. You know? Because they have made an effort across the board here and there, but it's just I don't know, more could have been done in the beginning.
