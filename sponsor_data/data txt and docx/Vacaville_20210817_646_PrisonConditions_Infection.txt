This story was told by a person incarcerated at Vacaville.</br></br>

Caller: Okay, number one, when it started last year, right, I was in the so-called, that's why I'm saying so-called, [redacted], that's outside this main line. But, it's inside the perimeter, but I mean, it's outside the main line setting here, the building. It's supposed to be the ADA, because I'm ADA, and medical prisoners.</br></br>

Okay, when the COVID started, okay, the breakdown, I wrote this in the letter, the originality of the COVID-19 virus in the system started with prison guards at Chino. Down at Chino, at Chino in San Bernardino County or Riverside County. It's right there.</br></br>

And the guards brought it in, and then the prisoners ended up getting it. Well, what they did, the California Department of Corrections, transported a bus load of prisoners that were positive to San Quentin, okay. At San Quentin, you know, the population is big.</br></br>

Well, after they got there, ended up 2,000 and something prisoners ended up being positive with COVID out of a population of 3,000-something. And then, from there they sent some prisoners here to Vacaville that were sick, and it started spreading here. Plus, we have staff coming in with COVID, too.</br></br>

Caller: Okay, so, this was last year. Okay, so then, on a, they started giving us the, what do you call, the swabs, the nose swabs, on a regular basis in the dorm. There's two dorms out there. Supposed to be level twos, ADA and medical, but they made the [redacted] into a dog dorm. So, they got a dog program there with so-called ADA and medical patients.</br></br>

And I wasn't in that dorm, I was in the [redacted] dorm. So, during that time people that ended up getting positive were moved out and we had all negative results in the dorm until they started moving people from [redacted] dorm over to [redacted] dorm that were positive. In other words, they're sort of playing musical chairs and a whole bunch of people started getting sick.</br></br>

And then, after that they came in with tents to put on the yard, right, for people that had COVID. They brought National Guard Army tents in and closed down the yard, and put up tents for people that have COVID. Because a whole bunch of people here were getting COVID.</br></br>

Well, what they did, those supposed to be positive, they would take a negative prisoners that was from inside [redacted] dorm and put them out there in the tent with the positive person. And what they were doing, just playing musical chairs. That's why a lot of people started getting sick.
