To be inside during this time has been like...</br></br>

To have reduced visitation from family and loved ones has been like...</br></br>

I feel about my wellbeing inside... </br></br>

How I been coping with this crisis is...</br></br>

I cope with this crisis by telling myself there is a very important fact to learn about all of this. That health, freedom from disease, is priceless. That we are dependent on each other for our survival. That what people around me, and not around me, does impact my wellbeing. Ripple effect, that to treat people with respect is required.</br></br>  

Not to panic during difficult occurrences. And to know that things are subject to change. To know that I am not the only one going through tough times. Not to be possessive of material objects. Not to be expected to be treated better than the people suffering in society. To be sensitive to all of the lives lost. To value life. Time spent on earth as special.</br></br> 

To be inside during this time has been like inside a video game with a child at the control turning, changing you every which way at his plan, intent without you ever knowing what will happen next. It’s like not thinking, and planning and someone else doing it for you at a level you never ever imagined.</br></br>

To have reduced visitation from family and loved ones, it’s like being on an off-limit island that is for bidden to the free society. Giving the powers at be an opportunity to invent something new to satisfy the need.</br></br>

To have been inside during this time has been like me being watered, cultivated to grow, sprout, mature into a blossom tree with leaves of knowledge and wisdom.
