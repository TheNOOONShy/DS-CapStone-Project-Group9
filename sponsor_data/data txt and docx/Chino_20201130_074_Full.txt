This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Chino.</br></br>

Dear UCI,</br></br>

Thank you for your interest in the debacle that is prison during COVID. Chino has been hit hard. I've personally known four guys who died, and literally dozens and dozens who got sick. For whatever reason, I have never tested positive nor had a single symptom. Lucky I guess.</br></br>

I don't know what it's like to struggle for breathe, sweat from a fever, or be dependent upon CDCR to stay alive. What I do know is that the system (CDCR) as a whole is functionally unable to handle anything outside of warehousing human beings. Actually, "human bodies" may be a more appropriate term since "beings" implies a form of normal existence.</br></br>

As soon as COVID hit this year, the movement started. Staff for reasons unknown and counterintuitive shuffled 20 to 50 people at a time to different buildings, different yards, and different prisons. At this time, the finger pointing also started. Correctional officers (COs) blamed medical; medical blamed COs. One correctional officer in particular told me it was the fault of the "Libs" and "Dems" that we were being moved so much.</br></br>

The only agreement between the powers-that-be was "we are following orders". No one really knows the logic or reason behind these orders, but we all paid and continue to pay the price.</br></br>
 
In April 2020 I was part of 21 people moved into an emergency housing unit, set up in the gym. Basically, a basketball court with 50 bunks set up from baseline to baseline, and sideline to sideline. There were approximately 20 guys already in there from a previous move a couple weeks prior. Well, long story short, about three weeks into it, COVID got in there and more than half the guys tested positive.</br></br> 

Chino's solution? Put the positive on one side of the court and the negative on the other. Brilliant!</br></br>

After a few days, someone (obviously a genius) said, "We should move the positive people somewhere." It took two more days to do the bed moves because one eight hour shift was evidently not long enough for the COs to enter 25 names into a computer. 25 other guys were moved in, while the positive guys were moved out. Over the next few months more and more guys in the gym caught COVID.</br></br>

Their beds were usually filled in a day or two with non-positive inmates. In the end, when I was moved out in October 2020, there were four of us left that never caught it; at least 60 did catch it in the gym, and two died that I know of.</br></br>
 
I know many other experiences were much worse than mine. My friend was moved eight times in three weeks. My friend was sent to San Quentin. The word is that it has been horrible for hm and the other 119 guys that were tragically forced to go. I will leave those stories to the poor souls who were unlucky enough to get caught in the wisdom of CDCR.</br></br>

How could this happen?</br></br>

Academics and prison advocates will study this mess for a long time. I would suggest they look at the influence of unions in the public sector, punishment v. rehabilitation, and human dignity.</br></br>
 
CDCR is essentially based on a paramilitary-style obsession with the chain-of-command. This obsession, coupled with the arrogance that comes with union protection, has created a major superiority complex which has permeated CDCR employees. Is there another department in California that takes over 12 Billion dollars a year and the public knows less about?</br></br>

How arrogant and secure in their jobs can a public agency be to admit that their objective to "correct" and "rehabilitate" is a failure 70 percent of the time, and then, still have the rancor to demand their title as the highest paid prison guards in the world? True fact.</br></br>

To my knowledge, no one has lost their job in CDCR behind COVID. But, many have been laterally transferred and even promoted. This is only tolerable because no one really cares about prisons or prisoners.</br></br>

Well of course, that is an exaggeration. I don't like to argue in terms of generalities and stereotypes, but the general public has been fed tough-on-crime rhetoric for so long they are willing to rationalize insane punishments. Giving the impression that they don't care about prisons or prisoners.</br></br>

Longer and longer sentences were handed down since the 70s and especially after '94. Rehabilitation was thrown to the wayside. People went to prison, and then went back to prison. Over and over, until a sentence could be a fixed that would guarantee that they stay for life. Most of the guys who have been killed by COVID followed this pattern.</br></br>

When a person becomes a CDCR number for life, their human dignity is taken from them.</br></br>

That number becomes a label. Just like a CKU number on a can of beans on a grocery store shelf. And just like a can of beans, we can be moved around with impunity. Moved around for any reason at all. When inspectors are looking, the dented and damaged are put in the back – hidden from view. When space is needed 100, 200, 300 can be uprooted and transferred to another shelf. Who cares? They're just numbered items.</br></br>

I will leave it to the academics and advocates to distill the psychological and sociological impacts that these influences have had, and will continue to have. They will recognize my thoughts on the issues at hand none of this is original. Nevertheless, it cannot be stressed enough: the prison system is fucked up.</br></br>

Why I will survive.</br></br>

Viktor Frankl points out that as long as a man has a "why" to live he can bear almost any "how". My "why" is that I do not want to end up as the "human body" that CDCR is prolific at creating. COVID is just another challenge that has been thrown in my way. Its one of many obstacles that has appeared during my term of incarceration.</br></br>

Old convicts know how to deal with violence, oppression, isolation, injustice, and everything else that comes with doing time. I have experienced these things myself and been offered decades worth of advice on how to cope with those issues. Yet, no one knows how to cope with a pandemic in prison.</br></br>

I am setting my own course. I've seen tough-guy convicts turned into frightened children, I've seen soft guys begging their loved ones to find a lawyer that can reduce their already short sentence. People are losing their minds in here. They are becoming exactly what CDCR wants: a being, formed by the parameters set by CDCR. This is their course, not mine.</br></br>

Since April I have finished five courses for my bachelor's degree (paid for by my family), written two book reports for the parole board, did a correspondence class on connecting-the-dots of my life and crime, completed a self-help work book on anger management, and found a way to workout six days a week. I made the choice to see COVID as a challenge to work through.</br></br>

Suffering builds character. I will suffer in order to change for the better. I refuse to come out of this the same person I was when I came in. I received visits every weekend prior to COVID. I miss my family and friends tremendously. But visits are not in the hand that I am currently dealt. Some guys have used this fact to become bitter and to act out in self-sabotaging ways; Violence and substance abuse are on steep inclines. The coping skills I use are different.</br></br> 

My desire to become a better person is greater than my desire to see my family and friends in a potentially dangerous environment. This doesn't make me better than anybody, just different. I have a different "why" than 99 percent of the guys around me.</br></br>

What can we do?</br></br>

The first thing is to recognize that COVID has been hard on everyone inside and outside. Then recognize that quarantine in prison is without Netflix, Uber Eats, Amazon Prime, internet access, disinfectant, outdoor dining, FaceTime, etc. Go to a local park, lock yourself in the bathroom (steel toilets, graffiti, and all) with about six strangers that's quarantine in prison.</br></br>

Next, recognize that the prison system is basically God's junk drawer: there are some useful things (or people) in here. Those people deserve to get out of here. The sentencing structure in California must be drastically re-calculated.</br></br>
 
Lastly, this crisis can be a catalyst of positive change. We are never going back to "normal". (Was "normal" even that great?) We can change the system now in order to avoid the chaos that an overloaded prison system has been allowed to create for 30 plus years.</br></br>

I can't do this. You can't do this. But We can do this. I implore everyone reading this to stop yelling at one another. Stop believing there is only one way to fix this problem. Stop believing that we cannot fight city hall fairly and through the system in place we can!</br></br>

If we find our "why", we can bear almost any "how" including COVID in the California Department of Confusion and Redtape (CDCR).</br></br>

Fortitudine Vincimus.</br></br>

To whom it may concern,</br></br>

I don't know if this is what you're looking for. I wrote this one morning after I received the letter you sent. This could be a scam. Some land is nowhere near Irvine. This could be a mistake.</br></br> 

Maybe there is another [redacted] in the system. I don't know but I enjoyed writing down my not well-thought-out thoughts on the matter. And I'd love to hear more about your project, given it is not a scam or a mistake. So long.
