I know it’s not easy to stay as safe here nor out there with this COVID situation. Yet and still, we all must follow and adhere to the health and safety protocol, here more so.</br></br>

Due to the conditions and circumstances, and lack of real concern for inmates in prisons in California, to say the least. By its own administration of CDCR, etc., whom constantly show deliberate indifference to the staff’s reprisal, harassment, neglect, etc., inmates like myself who tell our stories, file institutional grievances, appeals or more.</br></br>

On the neglect of health care, safety protocols, etc., not being followed to the point of cruel and unusual punishment and abuse. As I was while in (CTF) Correctional Training Facility. When around November 26, 2020 I was “confirmed I had in fact contracted COVID-19.” But was not told till days, week or so later.</br></br>

After being in CTF for about three to three and a half weeks. With piles of 40-50 or more pounds of filthy clothes. Including COVID-19 contaminated clothes and four to ten mattresses, two to five large laundry carts full of filthy and contaminated clothes. (Intentionally placed) about two to three feet in front of my cell 24-7.</br></br>

Door has about three to four inches gap at bottom of my cell. Plus the larger back cell windows were broken out and windows faced outside ad seg yard cages, one and a half to two feet from my back window. With dog cages for ad seg inmates’ yard.</br></br>

Even after I notified CTF, CDCR staff, COs, sergeant, and lieutenant for weeks that these problems not only existed, but that “I’m a high risk COVID case.” They did nothing to rectify or even attempt to follow COVID-19 and CDC protocols to protect me. Until I caught COVID and was considered COVID-19 positive November 26, 2020.</br></br>

When two prison COs, officer came and told me they were moving me to CTF segregation unit in COVID-19 positive inmates unit. Without me being issued any type of CDCR’s medical department’s documentation, to confirm to me I in fact have COVID-19 positive test results. I was issued said CDCR’s medical COVID-19 positive documents “weeks to months after.”</br></br>

I was placed in CTF ad seg COVID-19 unit. Then I was threaten if I would not go to a cell in that unit my TV might not work “if” I did not go to the COVID unit cell without CDCR, or CDC, medical COVID-19 positive documents, etc… Then my TV suddenly came up cracked and not working.</br></br>

Which CDCR refused to compensate me for. Then personal property of mine in (CDCR) staff care came up missing. Then they refused me CDCR personal property receipts to verify the exact property I have.</br></br>

These are only some of the retaliation I’ve been subjected to. Including my prison etc. canteen food items, missing and or contaminated constantly. I’ve had inmate request 22s and appeals on it simply vanish. And no investigations into it. On to those issues your letter ask me about.
