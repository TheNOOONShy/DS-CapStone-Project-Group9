Hello back PrisonPandemic,</br></br>All of the points of interest you have mentioned in your introductory letter to me, are reflective to the pandemic and its effects on incarcerated persons. I'll try to keep that in focus as I convey to you my experience, both past and present, as an incarcerated person.</br></br>However, what is most compelling, and I feel important to inform you of, really has nothing to do with the pandemic, and has everything to do with the nature of modern penal conditions and applications. Ha!</br></br>I know that's not what you're expecting as a response to your inquisition but you really school. And, perhaps you are, after all, receiving a lot of similar responses. That is because the basic disparities and atrocious living conditions have not changed much due to the pandemic, fact!!</br></br>Yes! Visiting has been greatly limited, as has face to face communication everywhere on earth been limited by the pandemic. And yet, our visitations with friends and family were already severely limited prior, so the added restrictions via the pandemic are a little less stressful than say, the further reductions of food (three bag lunches a day) and total loss of heated food.</br></br> No, it's not "red meat" (no pun intended), ha! Pandemic movie material, but it's super important fundamental survival torture being subjected to daily repetitive restriction of food. There is no variety of meat. It is all bologna in three or four miniscule varieties that is downright disgusting and rarely eaten.</br></br>Any study would show that they county throws away at least half of this garbage they are allegedly feeding us. This is because we don't eat it. Their perennial response from law enforcement is "if you don't like it," (need I finish the phrase??). This neanderthal response is given to every shortcoming on the side of law enforcement.</br></br>It is a universal response, and greatly lacking in moral, ethical and logical correctness. To cut to the chase, the Orange County Sheriff Dept. is only interested in returning ASAP to the status quo, as is the rest of world's people eager to resume their status quo. And the sad thing is, (as far as incarcerated people are concerned), I'm sure the OCSD will get their wish soon enough. There is more though.</br></br>Sincerely.</br></br>I paid the postage so please, please write me back so I know you got this letter and if you would send me a legal pack, it's just pencils and paper, if you inquire, I'm sure you'll be told how to do it. Thank you for your time. I will call if they throw my letter away.</br></br> PPS I'd be happy to elaborate on any of the forementioned situations, events, etc., concerning prisoner pandemic experiences. Thanks again.</br></br> PPS Oh yeah, I forgot. There's an official memo in the quarantine sector of Theo Lacy (two-week pandemic quarantine place) that states inmates are to be given "more than legally required sanitation materials and supplies". This is as far from the actual situation as you can get.</br></br>If anything, it's worse, constant lack of clothing during exchange which is only available three times a week, toilet paper is always supplied sparingly. It's a dungeon and they've reopened the main jail. The previously condemned biggest dungeon of all of OC jails!</br></br>By the way, my celly has been locked up here at OCJ for four years, hasn't eaten a hot meal for over a year. His story is incredibly unique. Please contact him, same address as me.
