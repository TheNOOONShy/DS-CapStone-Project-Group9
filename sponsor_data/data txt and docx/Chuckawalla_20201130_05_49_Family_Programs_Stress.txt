UCI: And how has the COVID-19 situation at your facility affected your loved ones?</br></br>

Caller: Well, I’m sure it stressed them out. They probably lost sleep. My daughter lost her mother to a car accident about a month before I got COVID-19. It turned into a pandemic, you know, because in the news, “Oh my gosh, everyone is dying from COVID-19”. It stresses them out, and it worries them. You know?</br></br>

UCI: And what has it been like for you to have reduced visitation and programming?</br></br>

Caller: Oh, it just causes me stress and irritation. You know? It’s like being punished for nothing, for no reason. You know?</br></br>

UCI: And how have you been coping with the crisis?</br></br>

Caller: I've been working out a lot and studying.</br></br> 

UCI: Are you currently registered, like, for college, or is it just your own studying?</br></br>

Caller: Well, I am registered to begin college in January, but I’m studying Relapse Prevention by Terence Gorski.</br></br> 

UCI: And what else would you like people to know about your experience?</br></br>

Caller: That it's really frustrating having to endure certain sit-, certain things or else get 115’s and get denied at the parole board. The COVID testing that was mandatory, and it shouldn’t be mandatory if we don’t have any symptoms.</br></br> 

Caller: So a couple times, I had it done five times. Two times, they drew blood, three times it wasn’t, they didn’t draw blood, but it was still uncomfortable. And why should we be forced to endure something that’s potentially a trigger situation or a high-risk situation?
