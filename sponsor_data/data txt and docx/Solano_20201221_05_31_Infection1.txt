This story was told by a person incarcerated at Solano.</br></br>Caller: Several people have diarrhea, blowing the nose, and we will ask officers for toilet paper and they refuse to give it to us.</br></br> 

And when they do give it to you, they give you a little small bundle of I don’t know, I’d say maybe 25 sheets of toilet paper. And you tell them "well, you know, this is not gonna work because, you know, my nose is running, you know, I’m blowing my nose." And they say "well you only get one roll a day," I mean well excuse me, "one roll a week."</br></br> 

And we’re trying to explain to them that, you know, we’re COVID patients. And they’re making us get on top bunks, and we’re explaining that "hey, you know, we’re feeling dizzy, you know we’re worried we’re gonna fall off, we have muscle pain" and they’re just like moving people around here and there. It’s just complete utter chaos.</br></br> Besides that, a lot of guys haven’t had much medical attention other than temperature checks and blood pressure checks twice a day on a daily basis. But nothing’s being given for their sore throats, for their runny noses, muscle aches. They’re not being given Tylenol, and when they ask the nurse, the nurse says, “Get it at canteen.”</br></br>

And then some of the guys are saying, “Well, we don’t have any canteen, they shut down our canteen.” And then they’re like, “Well put in a 7362,” which is a medical complaint form. However, it takes you two or three days to see a doctor.</br></br> For instance, they ordered blood tests for me, and nobody came to escort us to get our blood test done because they don’t want to deal with anybody that has COVID. It would be my guess, but I really don’t know, they just never came.</br></br> 

So that’s kind of it, in a nutshell of what’s going on.
