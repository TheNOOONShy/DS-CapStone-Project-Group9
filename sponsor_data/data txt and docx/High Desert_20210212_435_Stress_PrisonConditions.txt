This letter was written by a person incarcerated at High Desert.</br></br>

But when were we to receive medication for our symptoms. We never did. We all had to suffer with out meds. Some people died. It was all really horrifying to go through. Me as a person of the world, because inmate or not I am a person, but some will argue on that. I was scared for all human kind. </br></br>

I care for all lives. There is no other way to think plan. And simple how are we to overcome anything with selfishness. It's not possible. Now after we were infected food started to get shorten, which was already on a dietary level.</br></br> 

As it is, us inmates were denied to fend for our selfs with our own money. We were not allowed to go to store. So not only did we get the COVID-19 from the administration, it starved the inmate population in HDSP, and it get worse. Or us inmates do have money on our inmate accounts that the administration handles, as well we are allowed a package from 3 companies that they have approved for us, which we are thankful for. But when we tried to send out our order forms to those package companies, for some reason we are not able to do so, which is our right to do so.</br></br>

So still I remind you, it is a lose lose situation with us inmates at HDSP. My package from that has been moved into sitting in the accounting office for the past 2 months. Some inmates have no family to do things for them, so they rely on the prison administration to do for them. That is the way they make it so when we ask them we get no answer, or no real answer we should say, from them.</br></br>

And will we ever get a real answer, who knows. And the other thing that really worrying us so will we ever see our family again touch, hold, see their smile, hear them laugh.</br></br>

COVID-19 has put all of us in here through so much. I really feel sorry for the inmates that died all alone in a cell with no hope in site, with people that are supposed to care for our well being looking on like they have no answers for the lives. They are supposed to protect us.</br></br>

Inmates go through more than people out there realize. Did we do this to ourselves? Yes we did put ourself in prison. But does that make us less human?
