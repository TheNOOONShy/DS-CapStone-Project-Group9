Theme: Prison Conditions: Suggestion to Improve Prison


I suspect that if the tax payer could go online and look at a live feed of any prison, at anytime and anywhere, inside that prison via cameras, the face of Califomia's prison system would change so fast it would be overwhelming. ACCOUNTABILITY. The laws, our sentencing, the amount of prisons in the state are all the result of a public that does not know that they "need to know".</br></br>
The handling of and the spread of the COVID-19 virus inside the prisons would all be impacted with cameras. A picture is worth 1000 words. The public owns and pays for these prisons. They pay these guards to do a job. But what kind of retum are tax payers getting for their money? None. I envision a website that tax payers would log onto, that would be similar to watching CBSs Big Brother Reality Show. And no matter the individual's motives for viewing the goings on inside of a prison, i.e.; want to prove/disprove that guards are giving the taxpayer their monies worth, want to see what inmates are doing to be rehabilitated, how they are spending their time. When riots or staff misconduct is alleged, bingo, high definition proof one way or another.
</br></br>
Cameras need to provide the public with full coverage. I express this because for example there may be one or two cameras on any given yard, but all the staff know exactly what the cameras coverage is. So, they sit on their table or bench or chair that they do their eating, napping, etc. out of the sweep of the camera. Or they allow the cameras to become dirty so that the footage is obscured. My entire term I have wished they would wire these prisons up. Footage of guard's misdeeds is the reason they scoff at cell phones in the hands of inmates.</br></br>
The news classically repeats the mantra that inmates use the cell phones to carry out nefarious criminal plots from behind bars. Some may. I used the one I had that a cop brought in, to talk to my aging parents, play garnes, get cute pictures of baby animals, and educate myself in different matters. But the thing that absolutely horrifies these guards is when events like a riot occur and the prison tells the media their heroic version of the event,......and then some inmate sends the same media video footage of said riot and it shows the guards standing by watching.</br></br>
The reason the penalty for a guard bringing in a phone is only a misdemeanor, is because so many of them are bringing them in. Of course, when a guard can buy a cheap 60-dollar cell phone and sale it to an inmate for 1500 dollars, not a bad investment, eh. The prison also slanders inmates' families by claiming all these phones are being introduced into the prisons by having the female family member secrete the phone in an orifice to smuggle it in during visits.</br></br>
