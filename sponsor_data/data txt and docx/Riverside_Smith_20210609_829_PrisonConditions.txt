Caller: There was a situation where somebody assured and died off of the sticky situation of COVID of – what do you call that – of politicking. It's like gang rivals, you know. It's a bad situation. And I couldn't move cells and stuff like that.</br></br>

And then, I was, like, one of the first ones to get the vaccination and I couldn't go to court because the systems was down and they was delayed. So, they did not call me up for court, and when their systems went down, their lights shut out here and they had a power outage and, you know, can't get to a lot of people.</br></br>

And during some politicking rooms, rumors and about this, about that, you know. They labeled too many people as COVID defendants without the vaccination so fights broke out and stuff like that. It's just bad. It's a scary situation all together, you know.</br></br> 

I'm still looking to get rehoused to a better, you know, housing unit 16 where I can be in a program or something like that. I'm trying to get into – during that time I registered to vote. They never got back to me. I did autographing designs, I did my GED. I never got my score back for GED.</br></br> 

Never got my test scores back and everything like that because of the COVID stuff. So, I really wanted to sue. I called a lawyer, I tried calling an attorney to sue, a paralegal. That didn't work out.</br></br>

So, and I'm still waiting on my next court date. They told me a court date but I'm not sure what went on, why the systems went down. You know, I could have been sped up in a way or, you know. I just don't know. I just don't feel too much faith.
