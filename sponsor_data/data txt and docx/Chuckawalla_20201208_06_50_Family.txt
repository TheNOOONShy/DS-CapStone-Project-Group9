This story was told by a person incarcerated at Chuckawalla.</br></br>

Caller: Yes, a couple of my family members know that I got sick. And but they don’t you know I don’t really, they don’t really understand what happens behind bars right. They don’t really understand what happens here or how everything goes.</br></br> 

So, they’re just like you know get better. Hopefully you get better you know cause that’s all they know. They don’t really understand what happens right here inside the prison, you know. They don’t understand the procedures, none of that. They just ask me like oh do they give you medication, do they take you to the hospital, stuff like that.
