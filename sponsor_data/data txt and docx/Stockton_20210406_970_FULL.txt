This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Stockton.</br></br>Hello, someone passed me your info to answer you about COVID-19. I hope it’s ok with you due to him not wanting to do it. As in prison, dealing with the COVID pandemic was very difficult and presented staff and inmates with many challenges physically, mentally, and emotionally.</br></br>It still is for so many of us. Speaking purely from an inmate point of view, I have spent a great deal of time since it all began appearing in this country worrying about my family and friends outside of prison. My first concern was everyone’s health and safety.</br></br>Questions about everyone’s wellbeing kept surfacing and remaining in my thoughts. As people began not going to work, I began worrying about what everyone would do for money to pay bills with and feed themselves and their families. None of the kids were allowed to go to school.</br></br>In here, many of the staff were beginning to test positive and, as inmates, we were placed in isolation by forcing us to remain in our cells on some sort of quarantine: sometimes the whole unit was on a confined-to-quarters type quarantine status. Our housing units still remain separated from each other.</br></br> Due to the COVID pandemic, we are only allowed to have our daily prison program around the inmates who are housed in our units, anytime that we are not in our cells, it is mandatory for us to wear face masks. Failing to do so results in a 115 disciplinary write-up. The staff also is required to wear face masks.</br></br>Vaccinations from “Pfizer” were made available to all the staff and inmates, but not made mandatory. Two shots were required 21 days apart from each other. The medical staff regularly check our temperature and test us for COVID-19 by swabbing the inside of our nostrils.</br></br>The current modified programs can be difficult on me and I worry a lot about my family, but I do have faith that one day, this will all be much better. That is how the COVID-19 pandemic has affected me in prison. Thank you for letting me tell my side of my story.</br></br>
