This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Pelican Bay.</br></br>My step mom got the virus. My youngest son and his cousin got the virus. I lost four loved ones during June through September. Not one from COVID, but it all adds up and takes a toll with all that is going on. I felt relatively safe during all this as I have been myself and in a cell during the whole time, but was unsure as to how the virus can move in carry.</br></br>And if I got it how would it hit me? Like a bee sting or a Mack truck? I guess the unknown was the thing that is most scary.</br></br>It has been hard, especially being in here handcuffed and completely helpless to be there to comfort my loved ones. And they are really scared and worried about me. It really is a lot of stress for anyone to deal with!</br></br>All you can do is write letters and try your best to be comforting through a pen and paper sending your loved ones verbal hugs and kisses delivered through the tip of a Bic pen. It's really tough! Every phone call you get, you brace yourself for bad news and heartache and if it doesn't come you are relieved.</br></br>But 30 minutes of conversation with your loved one is nowhere near enough especially during this time with everything going on so it really is bittersweet. Add to that, you can only call two of your loved ones each month and you have to pick and choose who to call and who to leave out. It sucks!
