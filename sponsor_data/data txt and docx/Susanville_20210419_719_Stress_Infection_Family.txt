This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Susanville.</br></br>It was very sad they couldn’t even make calls to their love ones. So I did the best I could to give them extra trays and whatever food I had. And call their love ones and let them know that they were sick and were going to be OK and they love them.</br></br> 

It was the same story for all my friends. They had the same message.</br></br>I told my family and was wondering why they didn’t that I contracted a deadly virus. But I survived a lot people were dropping like dominos the ambulances was on the yard about four times. All hours of the night too. It weigh heavily on my heart.</br></br> 

Because I was lonely I was out but I was sad to see all my friends and I couldn’t do anything to help them except pray for them and hope they get out of the infirmary.</br></br>We all wished there no deaths. But some still have the effects. I got both of my shots. I also got to get a 30 minute visit with my family in March 2021. It’s been two years now things are opening up.</br></br> 

We got 84 days of staying out of trouble. Education, location, self help groups, and library supposedly were supposed to get more time off. But now they’re closing this facility.</br></br>I would like to thank you PrisonPandemic for putting the light on my struggle. And I also want to thank PrisonPandemic for contracting me. And I also want to tell all my fellow inmates keep your heads up and move forward it’s not ever until it’s over.</br></br>  

God bless and take care of yourself we will get through this together, it will be better.
