This story was told by a person incarcerated at Solano.</br></br>UCI: So, tell me about your experience with COVID-19.</br></br>Caller: Well, the thing is, they test you over and over again. So, it’s like once you, you know, take so many tests and a lot of people come up positive but they won’t confirm the positivity cause there’s a lot of false negatives. I mean false positives. So everybody wants uh, you know, they want basically to be sure, because a lot of people don’t have symptoms. So, it’s like okay.</br></br>UCI: How often do you say you get tested?</br></br>Caller: We test like, well when we first started it was like every three days.</br></br>UCI: Okay. And then what about recently? Have you seen any increase in case numbers?</br></br> Caller: Case numbers every day. So, what’s funny is that I mean you can test six times with nothin’ and turn around and then everybody comes back positive, you know what I’m sayin’? So that’s the key for a lot of people, but a lot of people who don’t have no symptoms. But to confirm it you get placed in a place where people do have symptoms and you end up gettin' it.</br></br> UCI: So, it sounds like they’re testing and then they’re moving you to a specific area of the facility where a lot of people are also waiting to find out if they’ve tested positive and then you are all kind of in there together, which then spurs the… Everybody then tests positive. Does that sound right?</br></br>Caller: Yea. Pretty much.</br></br>UCI: Okay. Okay. And how many people do you think are in the area that testing positive right now? Just kind of a ballpark?</br></br>Caller:	Shit, probably over a hundred.</br></br>UCI: Over a hundred people.</br></br>Caller: Well, it depends on where you go, though. Positive-wise, I think it’s close to 300 now, I say. Different areas altogether probably about 300. Each area probably about 100-somethin apiece.</br></br>UCI: Okay. So, there’s separate areas and each part of the facility then that houses umm...</br></br>Caller: Yea.</br></br>UCI: The uhh positive individuals.</br></br>Caller: Yea pretty much.</br></br>UCI: Okay. And so how does somebody then know if they’ve tested positive? Do they have to have outward symptoms before they for sure know or do they get their test back before they present any symptoms when they’re moved?</br></br>Caller: Naw, it’s basically, they come by and let you know that you tested it and came back positive and you on your way, until you get the proper paperwork. So…</br></br>UCI: Paperwork? What kind of paperwork? Is it a medical release?</br></br>Caller: Medical paperwork, yea, medical paperwork.</br></br>UCI: Medical paperwork. And so are you guys...</br></br>Caller: I...I... uhh huh</br></br>UCI: Go ahead, no, no, no, go ahead! I was just gonna ask.</br></br>Caller: Uhh, my thing is just you know, I think, to me if they would’ve isolated people and then just you know instead of moving everybody for exposure, stuff like that, it wouldn’t have spread because when they started movin’ people that’s when stuff spreads.</br></br>

If you keep it dormant and then say if a person does come up positive well then you know if he has symptoms you remove him from the, you know, from the area and then tests everybody again and most likely a lot of people there to test things would have came back negative because when they remove people and put em, they was negative until positive people came around.</br></br> 

So, I think the procedure’s kind of off, you know what I’m sayin, it’s how they do things... it’s uhh... like a custody battle pretty much but.</br></br>UCI: Mmm. So it.</br></br>Caller: You know.</br></br>UCI: No Absolutely, I, I, I totally… I completely understand what you’re saying. You know, the moving of people, just shuffling constantly, is maybe, most likely, you know, contributing to this increase in numbers that you guys have seen and umm the...</br></br> Caller:	Well, thank you for listening to us. That’s very respectful, you know, it’s very appreciative. A lot of times we, we constantly, we call people and, a lot of people take stuff for granted, you know what I mean? Because of who we are, where we're at.</br></br> 

And there’s been a lot of that going on, so a lot of people are hesitant to tell people anything because they believe you know? That basically, you know, like, you guys aren’t real people and people telling stories like a lot of people feel like it’s a hoax. You know what I’m sayin? So sometimes they don’t like speaking to you guys...</br></br>UCI: Yea absolutely.</br></br>Caller: You know because, being, you know, when, when you’re in a place it’s hard to trust anybody. You know especially when it’s the truth from, you know, you trying to hear it from opposite ends, sometimes it’s hard.</br></br> 

But to me I think the biggest flaw was, you know when the transfers go with positive people goin to a place of, you know, of negativity like San Quentin, you know they transfer positive people there and they had an outbreak. So, to me, why would they keep transferring people who are positive from other institutions when an institution doesn’t have nothin?</br></br> UCI: Mmm.</br></br>Caller: So...</br></br>UCI: Is that what happened to you guys? Is, I mean, was your facility, was your facility very mild with cases and then a transfer happened from another facility?</br></br>Caller: Yes. The institution had no cases at all. Until transfers came from other institutions with positive people. That’s how the eruption of what’s going on today.</br></br>UCI: Wow and so how have you guys been able to, to cope with that? Are you guys getting, you know, any outside time? Are you getting any, anything that is helping you guys?</br></br>Caller: Well, we were, but they shut everything down because the pandemic is going so rapid. So, everybody pretty much like I think 14 days pretty much isolation and quarantined, within your buildings and, you know, people are dealing with it and the cold part is, you know, in a time like this, you know.</br></br> 

For us it’s a lot of  growth, I mean people who have been down for a long time, we been through it, you know, deal with every situation and circumstances and whatever, tryna do what we can do. But the hardest part to me is, you know, they don’t have mental health for a lot of these dudes that really need it, that never dealt with it. And I think that slacking of that doesn’t help the cause of a person going through a crisis.</br></br>As far as not being able to deal with it, you know, and to me I think that’s a big thing no matter how shit come in, too. You know areas like that to be able to ask questions, if people need to talk to ‘em to be able to, you know what I’m sayin’?</br></br>

Some comfort, I mean, if people can’t see their loved ones but mentally it’s a lot of mental strain for a lot of people. You know, and the stress level is high for a lot of these guys and to me mental health should really be the focal point for a lot of individuals here. Especially when you’re goin’ through something like this that they’ve never experienced.
