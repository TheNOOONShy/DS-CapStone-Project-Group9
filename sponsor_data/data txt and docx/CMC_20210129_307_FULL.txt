This letter was written by a person incarcerated at CMC (California Men’s Colony).</br></br>

On January 27, 2021, I received your letter post-dated January 20, 2021. Please post this on your website with my names and address, not anonymously. I’m not losing any sleep over anybody till I do this!</br></br>

1. The warden has order our mail to hold on to and re-read.</br></br>

2. Some staff is not going along with this underhanded policy.</br></br>

3. Staff is divided in this pandemic. One camp doesn’t want to get vaccine and with the UK and South African variant gives their position legs. This concentration camp is Trump country. They really believe the 400,000 deaths are make believe.</br></br>

4. The staff that is the minority and are scared of the majority.</br></br>

5. I contracted the COVID-19 and feeling the effects.</br></br>

6. It's amazing to see how staff is intimate medical staff and the majority has once again scared the minority. The number one thing is scare the masses that the release of inmates is dangerous. The fundamental issue is the COPPA can not have prison closing due to the pandemic. They will lose power because more people will be laid off and the tax dollars may be allocated to education.</br></br>

7. In regards to my safety, I don’t have any! They are moving individuals with COVID-19 around so we all get it, period. So there is no safety at all.</br></br>

8. The reduction of visitation plays to their agenda. If your support system doesn’t have the drive, they win, because you don’t know what’s going on in here. </br></br>

9. The aspect of coping with this crisis! It’s worse in here. They (meaning inmates) think staff is their friend and don’t realize it's been introduced to the institution via the free world. If they can get a 15-minute phone call to talk to someone who is (not) doing what you’re doing, it's all good.</br>

That right there makes it more stressful.</br></br>

What I will do is get photocopies of some documents so you can post them please.</br></br>

Thank you!
