This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Chowchilla.</br></br>

I was asked to participate in your question and answer survey.</br></br>  1. What has it been like inside during this time?</br></br> 
It has been horrible. We're totally locked down. No church, library, groups, most of all no visits. As well, medical staff is very limited and slow coming. For the yard's skilled nursing facility, however, they continue to allow us the use of the telephones, which is a plus so that our family and friends will know that we're okay.</br></br> 2. How do you feel about your safety inside?</br></br> 
Not sure! This was even before the coronavirus. To me there are way too many “bullies” here and the correctional officers seem to be very limited as what they care about to do with it. Not only that, but the most important issue is that the only way any of us or all of us can get the coronavirus is that the staff and/or the free world people bring it to us. I know every time that it happens because we are all tested for the virus again and again. We may or may not be placed on a 14-day lock down. So not safe!
