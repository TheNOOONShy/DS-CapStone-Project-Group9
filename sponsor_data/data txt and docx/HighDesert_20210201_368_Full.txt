Respectfully,</br></br>

Many words we know, understand, feel, and experience, a course of our daily life. Some of these words would include cold, hot, happy, sad. Then there are more complex words which we only knew in their textual definition, “pandemic”.</br></br>

We now truly know, understand, feel, and are experiencing this word in our daily life. COVID-19, the disease of this pandemic, has brought with it many things including other words such as “social distancing”.</br></br>

Prior to the pandemic I was already socially distanced from most people because I have been incarcerated for the past six years. Estranged from my family and left to survive alone in a dangerous environment. How much worse could things get? Today I have an answer to that question.</br></br>

A year ago, when the news started airing stories about COVID-19 and how bad things could become, I thought, this cannot be good for any one in or out of prison. As the months passed, movement in the facility was restricted, visiting was canceled! Then came the worst news, COVID-19 outbreak within the facility.</br></br>

Overnight things changed into a scene from a sci-fi movie. The whole place was flooded with nursing staff wearing gowns, masks, face shields. No movement out of our cells for inmates. We were afforded a shower every 72 hours. Our vitals were checked daily and we were COVID tested weekly. But how could this have happened?</br></br>

Me, I do not exit my cell for any reason since the whole outbreak started. When my doors opened for a shower, I declined the privilege so that my door can be closed promptly. I do not have a cellmate and since my conviction six years ago I’ve battled depression, anxiety, and at times panic attacks.</br></br> 

I figured I wouldn’t get sick if I stayed in my cell and for weeks I only had two views out of my cell, what I saw on TV and what I could see out of my cell door window. The first was filled with news stories of hospitalizations and a mounting death toll. The second, all I could see is nurses and staff members in full PPE testing people and moving those who tested positive. </br></br>

I know for a fact that prison is not a safe place. As an inmate, you are not safe from violence, abusive authority, or illness. Many times you have no choice but to defend yourself from things that are out of your control. And after any attack of a physical nature, illness included, you will be punished for defending yourself. That’s just prison life.</br></br>

During a world pandemic, you don’t stand a chance as a prisoner. It’s like standing in the middle of the road, watching a truck moving towards you and the only thing you can do is hope the impact doesn’t kill you, but you can’t move.</br></br>

After a few weeks living in constant fear, looking out my cell door window watching this truck loaded with a dose of COVID-19 headed my way, it hit me. I got sick. At first I told myself it was something I ate because I only had a stomachache. But then my whole body hurt and I knew I was sick. </br></br>

All the information I know about symptoms or effects of COVID-19 are what I see on TV. Asking staff any questions regarding what is going on or what to expect results in the same answer: "We don’t know, hang tight." Television only shows hospitalizations and death rate. Not knowing and being kept in the dark about anything will make any situation more frightful, especially when it involves personal health.</br></br>

I didn’t ask questions or advise anyone that I was not feeling well. I just sat there and allowed the virus to consume me. Besides there’s nothing that can be done. There is no cure. By the time I contracted the virus, I was so sad and tired from what I saw on TV. Every time I saw a person on TV crying at the loss of a parent or loved one I felt a pain in my gut and sadness in my heart. Emotionally I felt the pain of all of those images and stories.</br></br>

How dare I ask for help or be scared to die during a pandemic. I have no right! I still feel a deep sadness for all those who have lost a loved one. And for the ones still suffering, my prayers are with you. Stay strong and care for each other.</br></br>

You see I was sentenced to more than three decades of imprisonment. Because of my age I am very likely to die in prison an old man of health issues in the long run. A virus killing me in a pandemic of more than a century would only expedite the process.</br></br>

No I do not want to die. Nor would I hurt myself. But if I could take all the COVID in the world, endure the pain and suffering for others and die with the virus, I would. As long as the virus dies with me and leaves the rest of mankind in the world to live free and without fear.</br></br>

I was sick for more than a week and it was no cakewalk. By the time my body had fought off the virus and my health was back to normal, an officer came to my door and said, pack your stuff, you're moving to the isolation building due to a positive COVID test. See it’s true when people say that the police always show up after something bad has happened. Hey you’ve got to find the humor in a bad situation, right?</br></br>

The building I was moved to housed all the positive and sick people. For those who are not sick but tested positive, they became sick once they were housed with sick people. For some reason my new cell came with freezing temperature and bad plumbing. It was constantly flooded with gray water.</br></br>

After 30 days I was returned to my housing unit. Nothing has changed. We are still not allowed out of our cells other than for showers, which I still don’t go out for, I birdbath in my cell. I lost track of the count but I know it’s been over 60 days. The holidays have passed while we’ve been confined to ourselves. My birthday is in two days.</br></br>

I suffer from depression amongst other mental health issues but I have made it past this virus and so can you. If you lost someone in this pandemic, keep them alive in your heart. Care for yourself as well as others. If you are struggling to stand with hope, think of me. I don’t know you but I will keep getting up every day and will stand with you in mind and spirit from the side of an electric fence.</br></br>

On my worse day of my COVID illness, I laid in bed alone in a prison cell struggling to breathe. Scared. Very scared. Would it matter if I don’t make it, I thought to myself. Who cares if I live? Nobody cares that I am factually innocent. It does not matter that I was falsely accused. The fact that I didn’t harm another person to get here in this prison is of no importance at this point. And my last thought, why am I fighting so hard to stay alive???</br></br>

Stuck in a bad situation under terrible conditions, in a pandemic, I found the strength to live in. So can you! Maybe I’ve survived so that my strength could be extended to you by sharing my experience. Whoever you may be I will keep getting up every day with the fighting spirit and a helping hand for you and those who need it. Please do the same for someone else.
