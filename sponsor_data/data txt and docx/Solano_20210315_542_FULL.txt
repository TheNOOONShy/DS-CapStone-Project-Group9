Dear PrisonPandemic Project,</br></br>

First, I thank you all for the support and hard-work you do for inmates like me. It’s good to know that there are still people who care about us besides our family’s/loved ones. I’ll admit I deserved to be sent to prison for the crimes I did commit, there were so many that I was charged for that nearly cost me my-life though that have no right being on my rap-sheet, and now they’ll be there till the end of time.</br></br>

Our justice system is broke! And because of that I and many others have to spend years in-prison away from the ones we love.</br></br> 

I’m 30 now and still have almost two years to go. I’ve been on the run and locked up since I was just 18. The cops where I’m from think they’re above the law cause of that badge they wear.</br></br> 

They’re so bold they’re telling my family that they’re gonna get me when I get out. Even so bold to ask my counselor when do I get out and told him to tell me they’re waiting for me.</br></br>

That’s a threat and if they didn’t have that badge they’d be in-here with me. Things need to change in our great country. I still love my country even after what happened to me and my family cause I believe in change and it will come one day. I know it.</br></br> 

I also know they’ll always be bad and racist people in this country, but if everything goes good for us that number will be next to nothing. Hopefully sooner than later.</br></br>

Now I know that’s not what you guys are wanting to know about but I wanted to let you know a little about me and let you know that I’m writing a book about me and some of my family’s troubles with the law. So please whoever reads this read my book if I’m lucky enough to get published.</br></br> 

OK here's your questions, “What has it been like to be inside during this time”? Well it’s been very tough on me and my family. I only got to see my son one time the whole seven years I’ve been away. It was a combo of COVID-19 and CDCR moving me around to different prisons.</br></br> 

I started in SQSP then to Ironwood, Arizona, Mississippi then back to Arizona, Shafter, PVSP and now Solano. And almost as soon as I got back up north COVID-19 hit the U.S. hard, we got put on lock down when I was planning to see my son and sisters. And there’s also just being stuck without programs to help us re-inter society.</br></br>

“How do you feel about your safety inside”? Well that’s a good question, the officials that run this prison do not know what they’re doing. They’re moving people around too much and because of it hundreds have caught COVID-19 in this prison myself included. It’s a terrible sickness.</br></br> 

I was down for close to a month and I’m young and healthy. They’re also getting false positives and just throwing them with people who really got it. That’s exactly how I got it. I wasn’t sick till they put me with the rest of the positive men.</br></br>

They packed us all in a dirty gym, then they started kicking people out after a week, way too soon. And they also started sending those men to buildings that had no positive cases till they did just that. Another thing, this is not coming from my-mouth cause I’m sure they’ll be reading this before it goes out and I don’t want to get in-trouble cause I’m close to going home.</br></br>

But people are saying that the CO’s are sending inmates that give them trouble to contaminated areas as punishment. Now I’m being very clear when I say this there are great CO’s that work here but there's also the bad apples.</br></br>

“What has it been like to have reduced visitation from family and love ones”? It’s been very hard on pretty much all of us we only get to talk to them on the phone. The one good thing that the phone company “GTL” did was give free calls to people that have no money. That was a act of kindness that needs to happen more often in our country.</br></br>

Now they know how their family’s health is and their family knows theirs.</br></br>

“How have you been coping with this crisis”? Well so far so good only a few others of my family have caught COVID-19 but we all pulled through okay. But I’m not gonna lie I feel for all the Americans that have lost their lives. I pray for those families that lost their love ones.</br></br>  

It’s a very sad time worldwide.</br></br>

“How have the vaccinations been going at your facility”? Honestly it seems like it’s going fair with the amount of vaccines available. I saw people get shots that probably could of waiting for all the older people to get it first. But again I don’t know those people’s health conditions.</br></br>

Well that’s it I guess, sorry if you can’t use my letter. I would of said more, but that’s not a good idea from where I’m sitting. Hope you’ll understand. Thank you so much for everything you do and the person you are.</br></br>

God bless you and your family goodnight.
