Dear PrisonPandemic,</br></br>

Hello, your letter found me in good health and COVID free. That's the start of the story. It seems like CDCR don't know what they are doing when it comes to the COVID pandemic. The virus already reached the facility I'm in with weekly COVID testing and quarantining the infected.</br></br> 

Out of 200 people in my building about 30 of us survived getting infected. The safety of not getting infected is slim. I feel I'm doing what is needed to be done since I been negative on all 10 COVID tests.</br></br>

But after inmate infected and done quarantined, CDCR puts positive COVID inmate with negative. Which is obviously the wrong thing to do but I guess it’s because there’s no room to handle this pandemic. I’m glad you wrote since I don't get mail. I'm 13 months upon release and hope all goes well and COVID free. Write back with anything you want to know.</br></br>

Sincerely.
