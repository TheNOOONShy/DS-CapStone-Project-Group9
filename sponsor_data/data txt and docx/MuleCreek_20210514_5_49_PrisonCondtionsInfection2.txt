This story was told by a person incarcerated at Mule Creek.</br></br>

UCI: Yes, first God we hope that everything goes well. Um how is it and how was the COVID situation where you are?</br></br>

Caller: Ah well here everyone got sick. There are six buildings here, and of the six buildings, first people started getting sick in one. They took out about 20 prisoners who got sick first. And they put them in another building, in that building they infected the others.</br></br> 

And that’s what they did moving from one building to another until we all got infected. But everyone not one was left uninfected. So they themselves, the same system , caused that. Because if they would have put the first building that got sick, if they had quarantined it, it would not have spread to the other buildings.</br></br>

But they did things wrong because they grabbed those people and quarantined them with other people who were not infected. And that’s how everyone was infected. And the officers when they came from the outside, they were the ones who brought that. And when they were here they didn’t use a mask and we would complain, we would ask them to put on a mask when they came.</br></br> 

But since they are the law, the authority here, what can we do? They do what they want with you and we can only put up with them. And that was how we all became infected. But due to medical errors, that they did not take precautions in that.</br></br> 

And there were a lot of people that passed away because of that. There’s frustration, anger, a lot of anger because they didn’t do things the way they should have. Several people died here when it could have been avoided if they had done things right. But they didn’t do them how they should have.</br></br> 

I only say things that I saw. There may God judge them and God knows what to do in that situation. But it’s sad. And there are many lawsuits because of that.</br></br> 

Because like I said, they did not do things right. And well here they are offering the injection to everyone. Most have already gotten it. There are some who do not want to because they are afraid of the effects it leaves or because of their religion or I do not know.</br></br> 

But there are many who have refused. I was also one of those who was refusing but I thought about it. I spoke with my family and they told me to get it that it was nothing bad, that everything was going to be okay. So I put them on as well.</br></br> 

But yes, in regards to the vaccine, everyone, everyone that wanted to be vaccinated has been vaccinated. Those who didn’t weren’t. Let’s see if they don’t get sick again and make us sick again. Hopefully not.
