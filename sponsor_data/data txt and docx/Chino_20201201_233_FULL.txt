Dear Sir: </br></br>

Written June 20, 2020</br></br> 

I am an inmate at the California Institute for Men in Chino. I am a COVID-19 survivor who spent 12 days in an outside hospital fighting a case of viral pneumonia. My life experiences were horrific - though less from the actual hospitalization and fighting the virus than the host of gaffs, blunders, and outright malfeasance before and after my hospital stay.</br></br>  

I offer the following account of my experiences not to grouse and complain, but in the hopes that they will be used to identify and create solutions to needless problems and suffering by those (like myself) subject to the whims and fancies of the seemingly clueless or uncaring.</br></br> 

When I was transferred to CIM in March of 2018, there were two possible yards in which I could have been placed - "A" yard, or its sister yard, "C". "A" Yard consists of dorms, while "C" yard are traditional 2 men cells. I ended up in "A" 5 - the epicenter of CIM's outbreak.</br></br> 

"A" Yard has 8 (eight) buildings of identical dorms. They are, to my knowledge, unique - as they consist of barracks-like "boxes" open to about 140-plus inmates. The week I arrived, the prison was just finishing expanding each building's capacity by installing additional bunk-beds along each open wall and crowding each entrance/exit door - in violation of CA building and safety codes. One can reach over from his own bunk to touch his neighbors! The non-air conditioned buildings are cooled by two large wall mounted fans at either end of each living area, to create a breeze by circulating the air.</br></br> 

In Jan/Feb of 2020, we all started hearing COVID-19 reports from China/ltaly. I had caught colds, flu, coughs almost immediately upon my arrival here, and commented on the impossibility of us avoiding COVID in our packed "closed-box". I worried because l'm over 60, and previously suffered "walking pneumonia" - both which put me at greater risk.</br></br> 

In April of 2020, the prison moved some 20 inmates from our neighboring unit over to "C, Yard cells as preemptive density reduction. In A5, requests were made for volunteers for "tent living". After volunteers signed up, 'tent housing" was abandoned. Fear of the pandemic increased with news reports on the pandemic outside the prison, and rules about the face masks were announced.</br></br> 

The prison issued "home-made" masks for inmates to wear. They didn't fit, and most inmates refused to wear them inside the buildings. We were made to wear them out on the yard and to/from the chow halls. Their poor fit allowed air to freely flow around the edges.</br></br> 

Prison guards openly violated the Governor's call, while chiding inmates for doing so. (One particular CfO, "Angel" stands out.) I asked my C/O work supervisor what tests staff undergo entering the prison each day. He stated only temperatures were checked. My own worry increased.</br></br> 

Around the last ten (10) days of April, the first suspected inmate COVID-case was taken from building A-5. Then another, several days later. Soon about % a dozen inmates had disappeared after complaining about feeling unwell. We never heard whether they tested positive or not.</br></br> 

On May 1, 2020, the Institution finally tested ALL the Building 5 inmates for COVID-19. On May 3, 2020 I felt symptoms. Headaches, cough, slight fever, sore muscles...etc. Later that same day about 15-20 inmates were removed from A5 to "C" yard for COVID quarantine.</br></br> 

The following day, other reportedly "positive" inmates were moved around the building (A5) to "distance" them from those "negative" (like me). By May 5th, approximately 90 (ninety) "positive" inmates had been moved to one side of A5, with myself and about 20 "negatives" moved to the other. Without any additional testing, the prison moved about 1/2 a dozen of these "negatives" to other uninfected buildings.</br></br> 

None of us ("positives" or "negatives") were required to wear our masks while "in our bunk areas" or actually "on" our bunks. And we all freely moved about, and shared showers, toilets, sinks, and ‘AIR" - though I avoided the "positives" like the plague (pun intended).</br></br> 

The fans at either end of the building continued to circulate the "viral soup" of everyone's coughs, sneezes, and other airborne spittle. Oddly, the institution took away the C-Pap machines for those inmates with breathing problems saying those machines "might" put infected breath-vapor into the air. (?!) No follow-up testing was done on those who tested negative!</br></br>

My inmate work assignment in A5 was 2nd Lead Porter in charge of keeping the building clean during the pandemic. In the month(s) prior to the pandemic's arrival, the institution actually began cutting back on the disinfectant issued to the building(s). My 3/W cleaning crew found it difficult to cover all the areas newly included as "at risk" locations.</br></br> 

During a Captain's meeting in our building weeks prior, I boldly asked the Captain the reason for the cutbacks at this time. Her response was that we were being issued what the prison determined necessary. We "Porters" bought laundry detergent at the canteen to help deal with the prison's cut back.</br></br>

I personally used a 1 gallon bug sprayer to spray disinfectant on all common areas and on mattresses vacated by inmates removed from the building for medical attention or quarantine elsewhere. But it was impossible to let disinfectant sit for the required 10 minutes on sinks/toilets, et al, that are in constant use/demand by everyone. We needed bleach.</br></br> 

Nursing staff/doctors came to our building and took "vitals" after inmates began reporting COVID symptoms. They only took the temperatures of us "negatives" to determine our health. They checked the "positives" by testing temperature, blood pressure, and 02 blood saturation. (I witnessed MANY of the "positives" showing normal temperatures. 99.5 degrees and below was considered "normal". I thought about the testing the C/O's were given in order to come to work each day.)</br></br> 

On May 7th , 2020, I awakened feeling so weak that I could barely walk to from chow (about 100 yards.) I had to stop every 75' or so to rest, and felt about to pass out. At nurse's line, I ASKED to be tested overall. My blood pressure registered only 80-85/xxx. (Normal is anything over 100/xx). The yard's doctor admonished me for not staying hydrated, and had me drink a bottle of "pedialite" (a Gator-Aid like electrolyte replacement.)</br></br> 

Apparently COVID-19 causes the body to need massive amounts of fluids at the same time your body fails to tell you are "running dry". I'd been only drinking what my body told me I needed...because the prison medical staff only told those "positive" about this danger. When my B.P. showed 80-85/xx, the yard doctor ordered me taken to Riverside Hospital for emergency treatment.</br></br> 

At Riverside Hospital, I received I.V. hydration and a new COVID test. I learned that 15% of all COVID tests are FALSE NEGATIVES. The 20 or so of us in A-5 who tested "negative" were just about 75% of the building's population. When I returned to the prison that night, I related the 15% figure to the prison's medical staff, thinking this might be some valuable new information. The prison medical staff's response was essentially, "Yeah, we know."</br></br> 

Shortly thereafter, those "negative" inmates who had been moved to uninfected buildings were moved BACK to A5. One such inmate told me he had been ostracized by the "uninfected" inmates in those buildings, who protested his presence to the C.O's there. He also stated that inmates in the uninfected buildings who tried to talk to, or get close to him, were beaten up by their peers.</br></br> 

On May 12,2020, my B.P., 02 blood saturation and temperature had all deteriorated. I was told I might be moved to the prison's clinic for closer monitoring. At about 5 p.m., I was told to step outside to "talk to medical." Instead of "talk", I was summarily whisked off to Tri City Hospital in San Diego. I still (as of this writing, 6122020) have no idea what happened to my personal/legal property left unsecured on my bunk after I stepped out to "talk to medical".</br></br> 

At Tri City Hospital I was stripped of my remaining personal and state clothing and my I.D. and an officer told me, as he walked out the door, it would all be sent back to my prison's housing unit at ClM. (This would have lasting and unfortunate repercussions.) I was given 02 for three days and returned to CIM that Friday, dressed only in a paper prison jumpsuit and a pair of hospital socks.</br></br> 

At CIM, the prison decided I "wasn't done yet", and immediately sent me to Riverside hospital for more treatment - still dressed in the paper jumpsuit and socks.</br></br> 

The medical staff at Riverside was great. They treated me like a human being, provided me with hygiene items to clean myself and shave. The C/O's tasked with "guarding" me chained me to the bed. I had to pee in a bedside bottle. Pooping required me to ask hospital staff to locate the C.O's and have them unchain me so I could use the toilet about 5' from the bed. (The C.O.'s complained about it every time.)</br></br> 

This wasn't a problem for the first four days, because antibacterial I.V.'s leave you unable to poop. However, once doctors give laxatives to solve that, getting C.O's to unchain you BEFORE you have pooped yourself in the bed, became a "problem". (On the last day I was at Riverside, an officer who didn't want to be bothered with responding at all, simply got a longer chain - allowing me to just go to the toilet whenever necessary.</br></br> 

Riverside Hospital discharged me on the day before Memorial Day. My 02 levels were consistently at or above 90%. For some reason, the prison decided to keep me in THEIR clinic (aka "hospital") for another 12 days - until my 02 levels reached 95%+. Prison C.O.'s working the clinic were annoyed I had no clothes or I.D., and complained at having to find clothes and generate a "bed card" off the computer.</br></br> 

I was put in one of their "rooms" around 8:30 p.m. A C.O. threw me a shredded pair of cast-off state prison pants that reached my knees - and looked like Robinson Caruso had worn them. I also received a state prison shirt, towel, and blanket and sheet. But no shoes, underwear, socks, or T-shirt. The room itself had a sink, toilet, hospital-type bed, and a small table on wheels. There was a 3'X 3' window in the back wall for sunlight. The room was about 10' X 15', with 18' ceilings - all concrete, painted various shades of white to offset the broken linoleum floor.</br></br> 

As I entered the "hospital" room, I immediately noted the absence of any soap, toothbrush, toothpowder, or a state cup to drink from. The C.O. ([redacted]) refused to provide them, locked the door, and walked away. It was 3 days before I was able to obtain a piece of soap to wash with, and 5 days after I got a toothbrush.</br></br>  

I asked for, was promised, but never received a disposable razor. Because I didn't have a cup, and the sink faucet was too narrow to reach with my mouth, and I HAD to drink to keep my B.P. up, or die, I had to use my cupped hands to get water - AFTER having had to use the toilet. Showers are only provided once per week. No other opportunity is given to keep clean.</br></br> 

The prison doesn't contact your emergency contact to let them know your condition. My first day in the prison clinic, I received letters from my family/friends asking why they hadn't heard from me since April. They were worried about me and had heard CIM was hard hit with COVID-19, and would I please let them know how I was doing.</br></br>  

I asked for pen/paper/envelopes, provided even prisoners in detention as punishment for rules violation and was ignored. About a week after entering the prison's "hospital", I was finally able to make a 10 minute call to my brother, letting him know I was still alive. After 5 days, I withdrew my consent for further “treatment” in the prison's "hospital". I was ignored.</br></br> 

In the prison's "hospital" you are alone in a barren room for 23 1/2 hours each day. I spent 12 days with nothing to read, no one to talk to, no way to write anyone. The highlight of each day was the 15 minutes each morning and evening when the nurses take your vitals. As to those vitals, I was very observant of my 02 readings, as they were my ticket OUT of this hell.</br></br> 

The last several days I noted readings of 93 percent, 94 percent, 95 percent. I didn't believe the nurses were recording them properly, so I asked the doctor what the readings were for the previous days. He indicated readings almost 3 to 4 percent points HIGHER, and noted I'd be “out" soon. (I have no idea what/why/how the medical staff reached the stats they recorded. They obviously made them up as needed, but I wasn't complaining, I just wanted out.)</br></br> 

Shortly before being judged "recovered", the prison doctor mentioned ALL the other buildings on "A" Yard were quarantined with infected inmates, and I would be sent to "C" Yard, instead. The doctor stated the design of "A" Yard dorms only were safe for housing either ALL recovered, or ALL infected, as everyone would be sharing the same "herd" characteristics.</br></br> 

My old dorm, A5, had been the first infected, and thus the first "recovered", and had been designated a "COVID Recovered" dorm for older inmates. My bed there was given however, which is why I am now on "C" Yard, despite such unit being exactly fitting my needs.</br></br> 

I am currently appealing for my return to A5, where I would be housed among others with similar COVID resistance - though I have little faith this will occur. I should never have been removed from that unit, as I invoked my right to refuse further "treatment" before my bed space and paid job assignment were given to others.</br></br> 

I would like to return to where my special skills and disciplinary-free programming enabled me to make positive contributions and receive the appreciation of my work supervisors. In a system rife with indifference, it would be refreshing to see some of the aforementioned problems addressed.</br></br> 

A social worker in the institution's "hospital" could once a day easily ensure patients have basic hygiene items, ways to contact their families, or a simple book to read. It's not difficult. I pray someone will respond to my story.</br></br> 

Sincerely,</br></br>
Incarcerated COVID Survivor</br></br>
