This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Kern Valley.</br></br>

I’ve been coping with the crisis the best anyone can. Before the crisis and the death of my grandfather I did a complete 360 in my life. I went back to school and got a BA in Criminal Justice/Poli Sci, and my Master’s in social work. I completed multiple programs such as Microsoft Office, Research, Public Speaking, Strategic Planning, team building, management etc.</br></br>

I became a youth offender mentor, leader, and a substance abuse counselor. I was working toward the preparation of a commutation packet to the Governor. Since November I’ve used the lack of program in the prison due to COVID-19 to better prepare myself for parole or release, even though I don’t have anyone to help me from the streets to file a commutation.</br></br>

I wish the other guys here could find it in themselves to use this time and pandemic to better themselves so that they can be there for their family and friends on the streets. Instead, they’re turning to illegal drugs and contraband cell phones to cope. Vaccinations are coming along. I received my second dose on April 2021.</br></br> 

Why so long you ask? I caught COVID in December. It nearly killed me. I went from 250 pounds to 181 pounds in a three-week time. I couldn’t eat or drink anything.</br></br> 

I caught it cleaning at COVID contaminated stalls. I wasn’t provided the right supplies and hazmat suits to clean and ended up hospitalized after catching a strain of COVID-19. I’m better now, I got my strength and health back.</br></br>

I think that covers all the topics that you listed. I hope I was able to shed a little light for you. If you want to hear of how the COVID-19 pandemic has made corruption and the introduction to contraband worst let me know. If there is anything that you want to talk about or know about, be it, prison, prison politics, prison gangs, or about myself personally please feel free to write.</br></br>

Another topic I can discuss later is phone calls, mails, religious services, packages from family or friends etc. You see you mailed your letter to me on the 20th of April, I didn’t get it until last night at 7 pm, three weeks is good. It was taking nearly a month and a half this time last year.</br></br>

With this I’ll close, as I need to write to some attorneys and see if I can find one to take my case on a pro bono and file for commutation/ sentence modification. I hope that I will hear back from you regarding the pandemic and that I can help you further. Take care and may God Bless you.</br></br>

Sincerely.
