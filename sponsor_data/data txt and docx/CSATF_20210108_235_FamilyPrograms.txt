I hope this response finds you all in good health as well. As for myself, I’d be wrong if I said I wasn’t alright. The good Lord blessed me with another day. That’s basically how I live my life in here.</br></br>

One day at a time. That is if I’m allowed one again.</br></br>

Since COVID-19, what little program we had no longer exists. And we just recently got put on a two week lockdown to stop the spread of the coronavirus from another yard. Before COVID-19 I facilitated Alcoholics Anonymous, and Criminal Gang Members Anonymous.</br></br> 

I voluntarily did this work in every prison I’ve been to.</br></br>

Although participation in self help groups among inmates who are a part of disruptive groups is low, I never let it discourage me. Being that I denounced my gang affiliation when I first arrived in the prison system. Dealing with those who are has been challenging, but I never let it stop me.</br></br>

I believe my life has purpose, and enjoy helping others in this capacity. However prison is not the place for someone like me to try and make a difference. The longer I’m here the greater my chances of losing my life, or extending my stay.</br></br> 

The prison is really set up for me to fail because I have a good head on my shoulders.</br></br>

I just turned 50, and have more years behind me than I have ahead of me. If I make it out of here all I plan to do is something good with the rest of my life, and take care of my mom. She’s a disabled veteran from the army, and I’m her only child.</br></br>

Since COVID-19 I really have reservations about seeing her again. I haven’t tested positive but I’m at greater risk of complications because of my age, and that scares me.
