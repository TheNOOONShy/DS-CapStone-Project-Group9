This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Soledad.</br></br>My delay in writing you about my COVID-19 experience within the prison was an intentional act which I truly apologize. The intentional act has nothing to do with the organization but my personal dislike with the phrase “prison reform”.</br></br>Prison reform has been an echo from the past that continues to find its way catching up to the present (future). In every election, there will be a candidate or two who will address the need for prison reform as if they actually mean it. Prison reform became a phase that the country goes through every year because once something new enters the lives of legislators, the importance of social issue (prison reform) always fades into black or in the back of the agenda.</br></br>I thank you for the effort in combatting the prison system and I’m glad that we inmates can be part of the fight toward change. There were events that has transcribed but I will only write about the ones that strongly affect my hope in humanity.</br></br>On December 2, 2020, I tested positive for COVID-19. On December 6, 2020, I was moved to the quarantine unit. A dorm filled with bunk beds and about 180 people that tested positive for COVID-19. On December 9, 2020, this elderly guy told the nurse he was having breathing complications and requested oxygen. The nurse told him that he would be seen the next day.</br></br> On December 20, 2020, it was pill call in the morning. The elderly man who needed oxygen normally took pills. The officer went to check on the elderly guy as to why he wasn’t getting up for his pills, he was dead.</br></br>On December 17, 2020, my quarantine time was clear and I was resolved of COVID-19; I went back to my housing unit. It should be noted that from December 17, 2020 throughout December 27, 2020 there wasn’t any COVID-19 test being administered or no vital signs checks. On December 22, 2020, I received a “Kit am COVID” ducat.</br></br> On December 27, 2020, a good friend of mine died. On December 31, 2020, I went to meet up with the kitchen officer to talk to him about my concerns on how the administrator was handling the COVID-19 pandemic by violating several health and safety codes. I asked the officer for information on pertaining to the side effect of once you had COVID-19.</br></br>The officer didn’t provide any information that could settle my nerves but told me that if I don’t show up for work I’ll get a 115 and mess up my chance at the parole board meeting. I will leave it at that for now but if you need more inside information please feel free to write and ask. And by the way, I no longer work in the kitchen, I took a stand! So if I get a 115-disciplinary action- then I’ll explain it at board when that time comes. Once again, thank you.</br></br>Respectfully.
