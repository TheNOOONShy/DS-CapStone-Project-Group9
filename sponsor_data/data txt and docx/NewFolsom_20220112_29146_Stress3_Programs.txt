This story was told by a person incarcerated at New Folsom.</br></br> 

UCI: How? I want to know how do you cope with all this during the pandemic?</br></br>

Caller: I write music, I write lyrics, I write songs, I write poetry. You know, I'm trying to get in contact. I'm trying to find a pen pal program so I can write to different people in certain areas because a lot of people are curious about prison, so I like to write people who is curious about prison.</br></br> 

So I can give them kind of a perspective/outlook on prison life. 'Cause they don't allow volunteers to come in this prison and level four, maybe on a lower, the lower level prisons like level one and two or San Quentin. Have you ever heard of San Quentin?</br></br>

UCI: Never. What is that?</br></br>

Caller: San Quentin is located in the Bay Area. They have a lot of programs there. You know, they allow people from the outside. You can sign up to get a walk-through of the prison chaperoned.</br></br> 

You can walk through the prison and talk to inmates and walk around the prison and see how it looks. They don't do that here. This is a level four prison, so they don't that here they don't allow volunteers to walk through here.</br></br>

So, my goal is to find pen pals and give them - my goal is to find a lot of pen pals and let them know what goes on in prison. Because these stories are never really told really. You know what I am saying?</br></br> 

They don't tell, you know, if you hear if you're watching Fox News and you hear there was a murder of an inmate, 'cause someone just got killed the other day. He was found dead in his cell just the other day.</br></br>

UCI: Wow.</br></br>

Caller: Last week. Right, it was on the news, but they didn't say much about it. They didn't say it was only like a flash, you know, it was like a flash. They just spoke about it real quick, and that was that.</br></br>

They don't know what circumstances behind it. They don't know if a corrupt cops was behind it. You know, no one gets the inside scoop of  things. So the fact I'm in here, so I know prison like I know the Bible, front to back.
