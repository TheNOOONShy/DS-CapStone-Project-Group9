This story was told by a person incarcerated at Santa Rita Jail.</br></br>

Caller: Well they’re not taking the COVID tests to try to transfer me during the COVID-19 pandemic because they’re trying to conceal it.</br></br>

UCI: Alright, I see what you’re talking about.</br></br> 

Caller: So it is during – you know it's during the pandemic and pandemic related. They’re violating people's health and public safety by transferring people that aren’t tested.</br></br>

UCI: Definitely, I see it now, sorry.</br></br>

Caller: Huh?</br></br>

UCI: Oh, I was saying – I understand now how it correlates to COVID.</br></br>

Caller: Oh, okay, okay. Yeah, so that's – that’s relating to COVID in another way that they’re jeopardizing the public's interest. You know what I mean?</br></br>

With the database – it's one aspect of it and during the COVID-19 epidemic – during the pandemic epidemic to conceal it, they’re willing to transfer a person without ever being – being tested. Because they can transfer somebody that's infected and infect the whole other state institution of people.</br></br> 

UCI: Definitely. This is a side question to that. Has there been any cases of that going on, like other individuals coming into the prison you’re at right now, and that occurs?</br></br>

Caller: Yes, Santa Rita had a – Santa Rita Jail has the worst epidemic up north than any other county jail. And they’re getting ready to hang it up. But yeah, Santa Rita County Jail has the worst epidemic of it. Because of these kind of criminal actions that these officials are taking.</br></br>  

UCI: I hear you. Hopefully they do get you that COVID test before you get transferred.
