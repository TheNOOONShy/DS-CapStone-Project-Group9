This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Chino.</br></br>

Dear UCI friend,</br></br>

Happy New Year! I’m from San Diego area, and currently in Chino prison (CIM). Never been in prison and am bewildered to say the least. More disheartening due no, family, etc., one out there. Here’s my c-19 story.</br></br>

I'm housed in two man cells on C yard. Also known as east yard. We’re two miles east of main prison. There’s approximately 790 inmates on this yard, except for now we are on a COVID program.</br></br>

One entire building of 100 cells was emptied for c-19 isolation for entire prison, all yards. To do this, inmates were transferred in spring to various prisons. The transfers stopped because supposedly inmates from here were positive c-19, and brought into San Quentin.</br></br>

On September 24th, many inmates were tested here for c-19 and unfortunately many had positive tests. When you get a positive test here, you must pack your belongings and go to the isolation unit on this yard. You lose your cell during this procedure.</br></br>

If you show no symptoms, as I did, you get out of isolation in 12 to 14 days, and put back in a regular building. We’re told we can’t get or give c-19 for 84 days from positive test date.</br></br>

They’ve just begun to retest those that are close or at 84 days of positive. A few, before major testing, had a positive with random testing. Only a handful on C yard, this so-called second wave, so far are positive.</br></br>

Personally, I fear another mass positive tests. I think there was approximately close to 550 inmates on the yard that tested positive. Only approximately 30 to 50 inmates stayed negative on this yard. Of course the only way the virus gets to us is by staff.</br></br> 

We can’t come up with it within a closed public environment. No visits, no religious service, no self help groups 'til who knows when.</br></br>

We are cell-fed and have restrictions. Wear masks and are supposed to stay six feet from one another, which rarely occurs. Heck, we must shower in a six shower-head shower side by side.</br></br>

Don’t get out of cell as we usually did on a normal program. Right now, always changes because of tier quarantines, we get dayroom daily for one and a half hours, at half a tier at a time. We have two tiers side by side on second story building of Alpine. We get outside for approximately two hours, two to three times per week.</br></br>

If by the misfortunes of someone on your tier gets a positive test, your entire tier is quarantined from going to main yard. Still get what they call mini yard, which is an asphalt fenced-in area. Quarantine lasts approximately three weeks. The whole tier gets temperature checks twice daily. What good that is, I don't know. Most who get a positive c-19 test had no fever.</br></br>

For over a month we had to use some old wore out masks. We just got new ones last week. Not sure when we’ll get another one. Those at first it was almost weekly and that stopped in November.</br></br>

I am not sure else what you’d like to know about the pandemic. Any specific questions, please write and ask me.</br></br>

Personally we are more down and out because of it. Especially the lucky ones who did get visits. No visits! They just started video computer visits in special area.</br></br> 

I’ve heard there’s approximately eight to 10 computers locked up for this.</br></br>

For religious inmates, they are not getting services, and I’m sure that affects them. Just being in cell extra hours now affects our mental state. Especially not being able to go to main exercise yard as much now. Who knows when we’ll get our regular program back.</br></br>

First we need to get vaccinated. Even after that I hear we must still wear a mask. Until we lose the masks, we’ll stay on this “not so good” program.</br></br>

Also some inmates, my cellie being one, say they’re not going to get the vaccine shot. So I don’t know how CDCR will handle that situation. No solid word yet if they’re going to make shots mandatory or not.</br></br>

 We shall see. I will take the shot most likely.</br></br>

I wanted to ask if you might know of anyone who would kindly correspond with me? I’m no one and would surely be grateful for outside contact. If you’re unaware of anyone, could you possibly post my request somewhere?</br></br> 

Please. I promise to be a thoughtful and respectful correspondent.</br></br>

You and all at UCI, anteaters be safe out there. Remember “no storm lasts forever.” Wear your mask and stay at least six feet from others. Simple rules that a lot can’t follow.</br></br> 

We need to beat this virus asap.</br></br>

In solidarity.
