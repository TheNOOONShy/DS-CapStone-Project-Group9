Thank you for your correspondence. Health care for me personally has been good. Iâ€™m diabetic, have pacemaker, hypothyroid, and a mild stroke all being addressed and feel I could get no better treatment elsewhere.</br></br>

I admire those of you who go into the medical care profession and wish you all the best. Stay safe, especially during this pandemic.</br></br> 
	
Have a blessed holiday season.</br></br>

Thanks again,</br></br>
