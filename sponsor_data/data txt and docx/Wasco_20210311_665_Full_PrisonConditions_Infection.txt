The struggle continues.</br></br>


To PrisonPandemic, thank you for your concern.</br></br>


I am an inmate at Folsom State Prison. Back in February 2020, I went out to court right before the pandemic began. And let me tell you, it was ugly. The county jails were not ready for something of this magnitude, nor did they care about the health and safety of inmates and staff as well.</br></br>


They continue to load us on crowded buses to take us back and forth to court, it was ugly. They have to be sued. We inmates can’t have soap and cleaning supplies and they wouldn’t even give it to us regularly. They finally started passing out masks but they continued to put us on overcrowded buses with no thought of social distancing at all.</br></br>


People were sick, they would bring them right back in the dorm with people that were not infected. They were bringing people right off the streets and instead of isolating them from us, they were housing them with us. So many people were getting sick until the ACLU sued the sheriff that’s over the jails.</br></br>


I was housed at Robert Presley Detention Center and it was terrible. It was filthy, just like where I’m at now, waiting to transfer back to Folsom. Wasco State Prison is also filthy and nasty. We shower maybe once or twice a week, no day room time, 1 hour of yard, no news on TV, it’s ugly.</br></br>


It’s so hard on us when they took away visiting. I really miss my family. Now they’re talking about skype visits. It’s not the same nor do I want it to become the norm. I haven’t made it back to my prison but I have heard they had a massive outbreak there at Folsom State Prison. I’m not worried though, I’ve been vaccinated already (Moderna COVID-19 vaccine).</br></br>


Thank you for caring. Love and peace.
