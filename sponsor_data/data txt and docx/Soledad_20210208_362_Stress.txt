This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Soledad.</br></br>My delay in writing you about my COVID-19 experience within the prison was an intentional act which I truly apologize. The intentional act has nothing to do with the organization but my personal dislike with the phrase “prison reform”.</br></br>Prison reform has been an echo from the past that continues to find its way catching up to the present (future). In every election, there will be a candidate or two who will address the need for prison reform as if they actually mean it. Prison reform became a phase that the country goes through every year because once something new enters the lives of legislators, the importance of social issue (prison reform) always fades into black or in the back of the agenda.</br></br>I thank you for the effort in combatting the prison system and I’m glad that we inmates can be part of the fight toward change. There were events that has transcribed but I will only write about the ones that strongly affect my hope in humanity.
