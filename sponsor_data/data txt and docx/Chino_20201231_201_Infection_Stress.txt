This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Chino.</br></br>

At first I was happy and ecstatic to be having a sense of freedom, and having contact with my family, especially my elderly grandma who has been waiting for me to come home.</br></br>

My hopes were quickly crushed due to the pandemic because right when I arrived here there was a full blown outbreak here and there was a lockdown with no outside movement. I felt like the rug was swept from under my feet, especially with so much uncertainty ahead.</br></br>

In my hopes I was thinking that the program would pick me up any day but things only kept getting worser and gloomier the mood the anticipation just put even more stress on top of what was going on.
