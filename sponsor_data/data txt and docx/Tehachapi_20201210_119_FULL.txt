This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Tehachapi.</br></br>

Greetings,</br></br>

To who ever this is that wrote me. Well thank you for your kind words. Now I don’t understand what it is you're trying to know about? The way it sounds you want to know what’s going on in here or if they're doing anything for us?</br></br> 

Well I know what this is all about. Well I’m not tripping about telling you my get down. Well you already know my name. Now for my story. I come to prison at 18. And I've been doing 30 years on a 25 to life.</br></br> 

Well you ask what it's been like. It's about the same. As always, I’m on a 180 yard, so there’s never any program anyways so getting no program is not new. And on top of that, I myself have been in and out of the SHU and hole 19 years out of my 30. So not being around people don’t bug me.</br></br> 

But I do miss my family from visiting because, as you know, my people can be dead or I can die myself before I can see them. Now as for thing in here, they don’t care if we live or die in here. You just better hope God is on your side when you get COVID-19.</br></br> 

As for how I been coping, I’m single cell so I work out and draw and write people and family and look at TV to pass the time. Well I hope I helped you on what you were looking for by writing me this letter. Well feel free to get back at me if you were looking for something else from me. Because I’m open up to help you if you ever want me to. Well with respects.</br></br>

PS: Merry Christmas to you and your family.
