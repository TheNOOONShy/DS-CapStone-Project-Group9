This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Kern Valley.</br></br>

What is like to be inside at this time? While it’s never a good feeling to be inside at anytime, the pandemic only intensifies being in prison for me and my family. I received two Moderna vaccines, one on February 5th, 2021, the other on March 5th, 2021. While I’m delighted to have received the vaccines, my heart pains for the countless millions that have not.</br></br>

In the beginning of this horrible pandemic, I was amazed and astounded about what I was hearing on the news. I mean “what the hell,” “China did what,” “is this for real?” I did not want accept what I was hearing, but it’s on the news and it seemed to be real, and it is. I’m like, I’m already in prison, wrongly convicted, incarcerated 27 years, two and half in jail before incarceration and now this!</br></br>

I’m concerned about my family, nephews, nieces, relatives and the people of America humanity, especially the children of the world. My God we need you now! I hoped this COVID-19 pandemic would be a short experience, you know, something that won’t last long. Boy oh boy, that hope was diminished.</br></br>

As news tells it, this monster is real and has proven to have lasting, staying power. Officers in prison, but not all, would not wear their mask, irregular uses of COVID protocols, information of warnings. Officers and staff were spreading the virus to prisoners and officer staff. It was shocking, unbelievable, and alarming.</br></br>

Incarcerated human beings, trapped in a cage of metal and cement with officers spreading COVID-19, which is literally killing people inside. A sort of death certificate and I was not charged murder. Imagine that, seeing news reports of grandmothers, grandfathers, older people suffering, trying to survive, breathes; families in painful despair, grief, horror, agonizing.</br></br>
 
Hurt is not something people should have to bear, it’s not fair. My empathy is for those suffering and those who cost their lives is unrelenting, yet I’m the one in this god forsaken, inhumane cage. I have a deep, deep need to aide in others’ pandemic crisis.</br></br>

Also, much, much respect to all the frontline nurses and others, it’s absolutely amazing, wow! I have been recharged with hope. I do feel then though, what magnificent sacrifice, words are lost for what my heart feels. It’s not easy, it’s heroic by any imagination. Award shows such as Oscars, Emmys, and Tony Awards can’t express what these frontline human beings do, have done, and continue to do for us.</br></br>

A humanity, as Americans, I drown in my appreciation for those who have continued to put their lives on the line for us all. These human beings bravely and courageously face danger and the danger is invisible, imagine that!</br></br>

Also, the science community and their response to this COVID-19 has been a God-send, miraculous to say the least. Isn’t that something? Their discovery of vaccines is greater than the Mars landing, with all its cosmos. These vaccines are saving lives.</br></br>

All businesses shutdown, American economy shattered, lines of starving Americans imminent I seen it coming because everything and everyone are connected. It’s the snowball effect, regardless of position, status quo, race, rich or poor, a disease is not respecter of persons. The sooner we all realize that the better, right?
