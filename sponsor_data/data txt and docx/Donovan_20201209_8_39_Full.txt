This story was told by a person incarcerated at Donovan.</br></br>

Caller: I just wanted to basically just give you a narrative of basically how the, this pandemic, this situation, this unfortunate situation, the whole nation, or rather the whole world, is facing.</br></br>

For us, over here and for myself personally, I have experienced basically, what would you say, kind of confusion at times and despair, not being able to, to see my family, having visits regularly. Also, not going anywhere.</br></br>

We have been on a pretty much in a lockdown. We are, we do have a little bit of access of having dayroom within a very small confinement of 60 to 66 people. The way that I see that personally affected me is really basically from missing my family.</br></br>

But on the other hand, it has also benefited me a lot because during this time I had been able to do a lot of preparation for my board, which I was never able to do before because of classes or work.</br></br>

And, the only thing that I do find sometimes is that there's various, various motives that individuals have personally. Like, for example, people that are going to the board, you know, they are trying to prepare.</br></br>

People who are ill, such as like myself that pretty much have nothing going on. But at the same time we are trying to prepare. But in the midst of all that you also have individuals who just don't give a shit. Individuals which just wanna gamble, wanna play cards and hook. Do not want any change in their lives.</br></br>

And, so pretty much you are within, youâ€™re in the midst of all that chaos of individuals who do not wanna change, individuals who don't really care, individuals who most likely will come back to prison again.</br></br> 

So, to summarize what I have said is basically that the way that these trials has affected us is, number one, that we miss our families.</br></br> 

Number two, we're in a very small confinement.</br></br>

Number three, we're not being allowed to have access to the yard or to anywhere else.</br></br> 

Number four, there hasn't really been anything given to us as far as to any type of therapy, any type of recreation which will help us psychologically and spiritually. We have not been giving any, any religious services or spiritual services.</br></br>

Basically, that's pretty much everything that I have to say. Thank you very much and have a wonderful day.
