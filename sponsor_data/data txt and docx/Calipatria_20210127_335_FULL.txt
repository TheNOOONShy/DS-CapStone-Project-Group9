Hello,</br></br>  
 
I like to first thank you profoundly for your kind words and obvious concerns in such tumultuous (and trying) times. Not often does one receive letters “out of the blue” in here behind enemy lines from complete strangers. But when it does occur, we here, truly are touched and highly appreciative of it. So again, thank you.</br></br>
 
Moving on, the fundamental basis of one's survival here in these trenches is the mainlining of one’s mental health, irregardless as to whatever dilemma we may face be it a life sentence, years upon years in solitary or as is the current state of all of our collective lives, the dangers of living with and through a pandemic the likes of which we’ve never faced: COVID!</br></br>

In an already broken system, the challenge of survival in these current times, has been first, second, and third, in relation to the severity of this thing, as well as our own collective responsibility that we (the prisoners) has to keep in mind how utterly important it is for us, and us alone, to ensure we do all that can be done in our limited capacity to protect ourselves, as we know that 80% (give or take) of the personnel here will be just as careless in their own lives as are a large segment. Of the society are foolishly and recklessly negligent in protecting their own lives, and more importantly protecting the lives of those whom they profess to love.</br></br>
 
We here know the importance of wearing mask, washing hands and keeping safe distance from others. Of course this isn’t a guaranteed remedy in avoiding the virus. However, it has been “scientifically” proven to be an effective measure to keep one’s self safe. Unfortunately, many people here have been plagued by this virus as a result of many incompetent personnel here who failed to take precaution personally, and as such, 100s of prisoners have been effected by this.</br></br> 

My own personal safety is something I protect until the death if need be. But there isn’t enough defense in the world to go round with COVID, but aside from that, my only goal is to continue staying focused and never lose sight on protecting my self here, now, and forever as it seem people in certain segments of society has decided all this COVID stuff is and was fake, and mask are for the “shape shifters,” and so it would appear that those people's goals are to keep COVID around for as long as possible.</br></br>
 
Having been responsible for destruction within my own community, both on people as well as property, I’ve come to learn over all these years all of the other life atrocities those communities faced without my help and others like me, and it is truly disheartened me, to see how devastating this virus has been to the Black community, not diminishing the fact that all communities have been effected by this. Nevertheless, disproportionally have Black and Brown folk been devastated by this pandemic.</br></br> 

The toll it has taking on my family, I’m sure is similar to the toll its taken on other families. Over the years I've grown a sort of detached mind over things that would effect regular non incarcerated people and so, outside of hoping for the continued safety and good of health of my family. I know that all I can control is my own actions and decisions, and people outside of here have to be in control likewise or else suffer the consequences if they decide to play roulette with life, liberty, or personal freedom.</br></br>
 
If I can live with my own decisions no matter how bad many of them turned out be. Other out there need to ask theirselves can they too live with their own decisions, especially if it leads to a loved one dying as a result of said decisions.</br></br> 

Thank you, respectfully, [redacted].</br></br>

P.S. Sincerely, I over-appreciate you for sharing your time with me and those in my current station. I hope I was expressive enough in order to fit whatever future positive reforms you feel can come out of all this. We too hope that something positive can materialize from out of this, as our (to some extent) overall view leans to a more pessimistic outcome. Yet there still exist an optimistic hope that we will never, totally, give up on. So thank you. You/y'all be safe!</br></br>
 
In solidarity, I, you, we stand,</br></br>
