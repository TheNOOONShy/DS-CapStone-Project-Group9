This story was told by a person incarcerated at LA_MensCentral.</br></br>

UCI: Alright, you mentioned the aspect of getting hot meals. How has that been like, as well, at your prison?</br></br>

Caller: Oh yeah, that’s a whole other thing. When I was in prison in the pandemic, they were serving us basically two cold meals. And usually, we’re used to two hot meals, and two cold meals and one hot meal a day.</br></br>

It was just, there were days, I couldn’t believe they would call the two meals that they would serve, meals. It was ridiculous. A couple slices of bread someday and a milk. It looked like we were, it was bad. But it got a little better.</br></br>

And then, for the longest time though, for months and months, we were just getting one hot meal at a time, a day, excuse me, not at a time. And it’s here, LA County it’s the same thing. They just serve one hot meal a day.</br></br>

Again, I just don’t, I don’t know how anybody… I look at it how I survive it but I don’t know how anybody survives these conditions. And they don’t understand that when you treat people they way you treat them, especially a lot who are gonna come out, it’s almost like, I always attribute it to they’re creating monsters basically because no human should have to live like, and eat some of the food they serve. It’s ridiculous.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah. One more question. How did you hear, hear about the, the project?</br></br>

Caller: I heard about you guys in the Prison Legal News.</br></br>

UCI: Okay.</br></br>

Caller: And also, in the Posse newsletter.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah. If you have, do you have any questions? Regarding our project or anything like that, do you have questions of your own?</br></br>

Caller: Before I left, I was planning on sending you guys, like, my 602s. And if I get back upstate or if I get released, I will probably definitely send them to you so you guys can definitely maybe post the responses from CDCR officials from a lot of these serious things that I said that I felt and actually was compelled, felt necessary to complain about and the responses.</br></br>

It’s just mind-blowing. The denial, the delays, the disregard for the complaint and the seriousness of the allegations that I made was just to me, it was mind-blowing, you know?</br></br>

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: And I hope to someday share that with you guys so that you guys can see the responses that are just, it’s just unbelievable. It’s mind-blowing that they would just dismiss the complaints and the things as they have, and the uniform that they answer them with. No regard for human life or the safety of people in these in these confined, enclosed, and cramped environments.
