<em>This story was told by a person incarcerated at San Joaquin County Jail.</br></br></em>

Caller: It was at 4:00 am when breakfast was being served. It was oatmeal and soy sausage, my favorite. Yum. I ate mine quickly and was hungry for more as they had not fed us breakfast for almost a month now, since the COVID lockdown started. They instead fed us peanut butter and jelly sandwiches all day. And with this COVID lockdown, they also have to keep us stuck in our cells 24 hours a day, although lately some COs can be slightly lenient towards what we can and can't do outside of our cells due to the fact that we've now all tested negative for COVID twice. But we need to clear a third test before they'll lift this lockdown procedure.</br></br>

So, with that, I exited my cell, having already eaten my first tray of food, and approached the top of the staircase to politely ask the CO on duty if I may be allowed to go downstairs into the corridor and ask the kitchen workers for another tray of food before they proceed to throw away the usual 20 trays or so that are extra. The answer I was given by the CO was, "No," as he waved me on with his finger, saying, "Go back to your cell." It was only a few minutes later that one of the kitchen workers were passing by my cell, cleaning up trays left around. I then asked him directly if he would be willing to get an extra tray up to me when he had the chance, if he could. He was beginning to tell me "No" because this particular CO is just trouble, as he then noticed that two cells over from mine was a tray left untouched that he would be having to grab and throw away anyways. So, he grabbed it and handed it to me as I began to hear the CO muttering something. But he's got this sort of raspy, whiny-sounding voice, always complaining about something. So, I quickly shut my cell door and ate my food.</br></br>

I assumed he was telling the worker not to do that sort of thing in reference to the possible spread of COVID. Twenty minutes later, the CO arrived at my door, forcing me to sign a write-up while claiming he had told me not to bother the kitchen workers for trays and I went and did so anyway, thereby putting me on a five-day commissary and tablet restriction. What this means for me is that I won't be receiving $50 worth of food I had ordered for tomorrow, including a pad of paper and more pencils that I am now out of. Beyond that, it means that, with me getting released this Friday, hopefully, that the stories I had access to only through the emails that I had sent on the tablet eight months ago will now be lost forever as I cannot copy them down on the paper.</br></br>

It means the brand new set of headphones I had just bought for the tablet are now useless. It means that the $13 I just spent on buying two movies to watch will be lost. It means I don't have a tablet of my own to make phone calls with now. It means I will not be able to pass the time for the next five days by listening to the over $130 worth of the music I had purchased on the tablet at $2 per song. And, finally, it means I can't look at or watch the pictures and videos of my children that I have on the tablet that I check out daily. So, then I am immediately now forced with the challenge of: How do I deal with all this? And how do I process what just happened to me, and why?</br></br>

I realize that he feels that I may have disrespected him by disobeying what he said or what he may have thought he said. So, he felt the need to flex his might and hurt me in the ways available to him at that time. And with that, the more primitive alpha male instincts in me want to reach out to my people and give them his name so that they could then locate his address through various channels on the Web, allowing them the ability to then go put hands on him at his home or worse. But, by now, it's becoming very easy for me to just accept the day for what it is rather than worry about what I wanted it to be yesterday.
