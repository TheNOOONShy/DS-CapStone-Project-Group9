Hello! I’m sharing my true thoughts of my experience with the COVID-19 at CCWF. I wrote a health care grievance up against “health care services” on September 23, 2020 because on August 27, 2020, I along with 3 other inmates were being taken out of our unit and room and placed in a place in which I started calling the “Dungeon”, because it was dirty, filthy, rusty and disgusting in the “Dungeon” building 503 on A-yard. I was kept there for 23 days for precaution as I was told. On August 27, 2020, one of my roommates tested positive for COVID. That’s how this started. We get down there and find out that there’s more than one person positive, there’s several at that time unbeknownst to our population's knowledge.</br></br>

Anyway my 602 complaint focused on the treatment I received while back there by the nurses, the technicians, and mental health doctors. It lacked communication, it lacked compassion, when I would ask about my health and the chances of me contracting the virus since I’ve been placed in a housing unit for alleged safety with several positive cases. And they're irritated with me for being concerned about my safety. When health care fail to properly dispose of their PPE after attending to the positive inmates then yes I have an opinion about it. Which will cause retaliation from correctional staff if not careful! Keep in mind I had to place 602 grievances to both medical and security sides of it.</br></br>

Back to the PPE, they handle the positives first for some reason, then here they come to our doors to touch on us. When I ask them if they could change their PPE I get attitude instead of understanding. They treat us as if we shouldn’t be tripping. My life matters to me, I love me, I am worthy of respect. I committed a crime, this is true. But I am not my crime. I am a human being that wants to live. And I know that the majority of society don’t care about us in prison, yet it doesn’t change the facts. We are people. We deserve respect and dignity like everyone else.</br></br>

I was literally scared for my life in the “Dungeon of 503.” The PPE protective coverings they were wearing weren’t being properly disposed of. Sometimes they would use the red bio-hazard bags and sometimes they’d put them in our regular trash cans along with their gloves. They’d let the positive ones out of their cells to shower, use phones, kiosk machine, all after we were done with our programming for the day. Only to come out the next day to find that no form of sanitation has been done to the location of these areas other than the guards sending in the receiving inmates in orange to so call clean.</br></br> 

While I’m watching from my window how the inmates in orange go in the contaminated shower, get the hair out of the drain, spray two to three times with their spray bottles and walk out of the shower. I knew the so called cleaners in orange never made it over in the phones and kiosk area because the same trash and open lunch boxes, crumbs, etc. would still be there.</br></br> 

So when it was our program time my anxiety level would soar. Scared to leave from my cell to go shower or use the phone. I would be fearful to touch anything, so I’d go to the guards to get some disinfect. Because it seem like every time it was our program time the disinfect spray bottles would be empty. So you see just from what I’ve shared there was and is a lot of room for improvement. With the understanding on both sides about this COVID-19, “We’ve never met her before.” With that being said it was and is a learning process for us all. So finally yea! Hell yea I fear and feared for my life then and now! God bless us all!
