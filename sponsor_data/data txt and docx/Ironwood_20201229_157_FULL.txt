Dear UCI Student,</br></br>     

Seasons Greetings to you and your team. I hope and pray that you are all safe and healthy during this time of uncertainty. I can imagine the challenges you are all facing as students. I want to encourage you and acknowledge you. I am thinking and praying for you everyday. I know that with young men and women like yourselves stewarding our country into the future we will only be stronger as a result of this pandemic.</br></br>

One of the biggest misconceptions about prison that I have encountered is that we are somehow living in some hermetically sealed bubble. I find this to be untrue. I view my life as being lived in a “medium” secured gated community filled with every person that you would find in any other community. We all face challenges regardless of where we live and what level of supervision we are under. There are issues unique to prison as I am sure there are for campus life. There is also much overlap I’m sure. As you rightly identified in your letter, it is not the situations that vary, it is the reactions or responses to the situations.</br></br>

In regards to the pandemic, I am experiencing the same things you are. I take every precaution I can to protect myself and others. I wear my mask correctly, I social distance to the best of my ability, I wash my hands often. Does everyone else? No, that is no different than in your community I would imagine. People either have a healthy fear and respect for the potential consequences of contracting COVID-19 or they do not.</br></br>

Staff is doing what they can. Just like everyone else, some believe some do not. Some have a professional ethic, some do not. Some care, some do not. I do not personally depend on staff to set the example or standard upon which I base my decisions on. So I feel as safe today as I’ve felt every other day. There is no anticipating what another person may decide to do at any given time. I imagine you hope the car next to you follows the rules of the road, however you never know…</br></br>

I miss seeing my mom terribly. My concern for her safety far outweighs any desire I have to see her in the short-term. That is very simple for me. I understand the consequences of making decisions with instant gratification leading the way. Coping with this crisis has not been all that difficult for me. I face every crisis, challenge, issue, and situation the exact same way. I identify my role in it, I control what I am capable of controlling, I change what I’m able to change, and all the rest I surrender to God’s control. I know how to problem solve using logical and critical thinking. I am aware of my emotional state throughout the day. I live a life based on love not fear.</br></br> 

I am able to communicate my needs and desires to my support network. All of these things built upon my foundation of faith in Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior allow me to live my life in victory. I have meaning and purpose which cannot be taken from me. I know that I am worthy of being loved and to love others.</br></br>

My heart aches for the people both young and old who are hungry right now. Those families who are worried about their homes being taken away. My heart breaks when I see the pictures of the people in the hospital. Now can we continue to behave in ways that prolong these consequences? This is of course the trillion dollar question. I do not have enough paper to answer that. If I were to sum it all up, we must love each other. Love conquers hate every single time. I challenge every person who is reading this to be the change you want to see in this world. No single person can fix everything. One single person can affect one other person in a life altering positive way. That is my responsibility and I hold myself accountable to behave that way. Thank you so much for all your work UCI team. I will continue to pull on the rope from where I am. God bless you all.
