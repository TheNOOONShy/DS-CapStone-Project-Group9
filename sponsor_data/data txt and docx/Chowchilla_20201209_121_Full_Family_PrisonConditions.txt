Blessings anonymous,</br></br>

Sent to you and your team of those who fight and care for people like us, who is at the school of hard knocks. Also, thank you for being one of the world's heroes.</br></br>
        
Thank you for reaching out. So my health is fine. Today I had a check up. I have not had one in some time. So I walked in the doctor had her back towards me. So I creeped over her shoulders to look at her nails. They were a little dirty.</br></br>

The doctor’s assistant ask doctor what size gloves did she want. Then I notice the doctor never went to the sink to wash her hands before applying the gloves. Plus the door in the room was a see through. Never in my 17 years have I’ve ever seen that.</br></br>

So I ask, would they cover the window even though they had a pattern. I didn't feel comfortable, people could see in the room. Yes, I did ask the doctor to wash her hands. She ask me how any should.</br></br>

She wash her hands first. She tells me I'm putting on gloves. I replied, yes, I understand, but you must sterilize your hands first before you put those gloves on. The assistant felt I was being aggressive. I told her I'm not being aggressive, it's my right to ask. I said to the both of them you know we have a pandemic happening, you should know this is serious.</br></br>

I was blown away but not shocked of this behavior. They don’t give two craps about us and our health nor safety. They are finding cases almost daily, if not weekly. I hope I explained this well enough.</br></br>

I’m not the best writer. Yes, I thought about calling, but sometimes 15 minutes not enough time to put out things about this place. I want you to watch the documentary called the Belly of the Beast. It's on PBS. It will tell you about what we go through.</br></br>

Yes, I am one of the victims from what is talked about on the doc. For the last week and a half, I have been quarantine. It sucks. My boss told me I might lock down for two weeks. The first day was cool but by the second day, I was ready to pull my hair out. But I am bald.</br></br>

This been more stressful lying in bed, I watch a lot of TV, I write down a lot of movies I want to see, all the books I want to read. Then my mother is 74. And she has been in the house since February or March. She did in home care and have client pass on, so that put her out of work.</br></br>

My moms has done that kind of work for over 30 years. One day I called home and she told me she was lonely. I’m the only daughter. That broke my heart. I do have a date and look forward to something coming down the pipeline for an early release.</br></br>

I'm currently doing time off the 10 year enhancement for a gun charge. How did you get my information? I hope I explained clearly. I'm not a good paper explainer. Visiting is a battle now. It is like a lottery game.</br></br>

We have these kiosk machines where we can make videos but yet they only allowed us to visit once. They claim there’s not enough staff. Lies. They don't want to allow those who has done the work as far as felt held following the rules, etc.</br></br>

We can’t go to a program like a reentry. I’m going to close with this. I pray that one day they will build some apartments for people who are fresh out. Who’s willing to do the work to stay out, hold a job, and be independent. Once I’m out, I'm not looking forward to living with anyone couch hoppin'. Again thank you for reaching out.</br></br>

Blessings to you and stay safe, mask up!
