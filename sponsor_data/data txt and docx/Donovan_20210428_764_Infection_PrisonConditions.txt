Dear PrisonPandemic,</br></br>

What you are about to read should upset you. CDCR has lied about the way it handled the pandemic, at least here at RJDCF. I started journaling in March of 2020. At that point COVID-19 had spread throughout the world.</br></br>

On March 3, 2020, I wrote: Economic stress has become an American Crisis. People are told not to gather in groups of more than 10. The shelves of stores are nearly empty. Schools have closed, sports are cancelled, and people are starting to experience heightened states of anxiety.</br></br> 

It's only a matter of time before a dumbed down society tears itself apart. If we survive this we will be stronger as a people because of it.</br></br>

March 22, 2020: The economy is crashing, the global death toll is rising. Governors are issuing stay at home orders. California’s own stated, “Nothing is off the table when it comes to enforcing the stay at home orders.”</br></br>

March 27, 2020: President Trump signed a 2.2 trillion dollar stimulus relief bill. Will this lead to socialism?</br></br>

April 20, 2020: People are starting to protest. RJDCF has been on modified program since the 7th. The global death toll from COVID-19 is over 160,000.</br></br>

April 28, 2020: Mandatory face covering issued at RJDCF and in San Diego. The beaches were open but closed again.</br></br>

June 1, 2020: Still on modified program - lockdown. Cell feeding.</br></br>

Riots have broken out all over the country. RIP George Floyd. Groups of thousands are looting, burning government buildings.</br></br>

December 21, 2020: Yard and day room program partially opened. COVID restrictions lifted.</br></br>

An outbreak has infected close to 700 people at RJDCF (ABC10 News)</br></br>

For the first time since the pandemic began, COVID tests were given to all inmates who consented.</br></br>

I believe this outbreak could have been prevented.</br></br>

December 24, 2020: Eight people (inmates) in my block tested positive. My celly’s test came back inconclusive. He might be quarantined.</br></br>

December 26, 2020: He was retested on the 24th and it came back positive. I am locked in an 8 x 10 with him. Any chance I won’t get it?</br></br>

CDCR should have tested staff and inmates sooner.</br></br>

Mass testing in CDCR-RJDCF did not begin until after there was an outbreak, at which point people were already dying. People I’ve known for years.</br></br>

December 28, 2020: Instead of quarantining my celly per protocol, he was left in the cell with me for three days and then after I’d already developed symptoms, he was taken to the gym.</br></br>

There's no heat in the gym. It's basically a warehouse. It's cold, filthy, and full of triple bunks of the infected.</br></br>

December 29, 2020: Last night I was racked with pain, headaches, muscle aches, kidney pain, frequent urination and painful bloating.</br></br>

Today I spent the day lying down. Moving makes the blood in my head rush. Tried to do a little painting but got dizzy. Bad headache.
