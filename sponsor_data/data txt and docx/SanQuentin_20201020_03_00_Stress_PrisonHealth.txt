This story was told by a person incarcerated at San Quentin.</br></br>

Caller: But prison is hard on health anyway. And if you don't eat well, or you don't stay active, or whatever, you put yourself in a compromised position.</br></br>

And the goofy thing now is I want to get back from this, I want to- I've got the antibodies, I know I've got em. But I cannot donate blood to people who are doing plasma, because I've been in prison. If you've been in prison more than 72 hours, you have to be out more than a year.</br></br>

So they're missing, they're missing out on, you know, some few thousands of guys that have paroled out of prison in the last 90 days, that could be giving COVID- giving plasma, they probably would be willing to do that. So who knows. It's just the insanity of it all.</br></br>

But it was really bad. And there are guys there that were very sick too, they're still there. Now, I know that there's some efforts to try to get some- not early parole, there's never really been early parole.</br></br>

As a lifer, you have to go to the board. So hopefully, I know, in my case, it helped, that COVID was in fact, active. I went April third.</br></br>

So March 18 is when they locked us down. So I think that had- played, you know, had to play in something. 65, you know, that's the age.</br></br>

So all of this in there. But there are guys that got exposed, that got tested positive that hasn't- it hasn't affected. So how do we advocate for these guys?
