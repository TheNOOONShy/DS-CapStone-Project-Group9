Dear PrisonPandemic,</br></br>

First and foremost, I truly appreciate you sending me a message out of nowhere. I don't hear from nobody so it was a surprising moment.</br></br> 

Anyway as far as this pandemic, it’s been truly rough even though I’ve already been inside 19 years and I’m used to being in solitude. The best thing, I’m on my way out.</br></br>

I’m a three watch porter here at High Desert State Prison. Some correctional officers refuse to give us cleaning supplies because they’re lazy and don’t want anybody cleaning.</br></br> 

We also clean with just water at times. I’ve been stuck here for over two years waiting to be transferred to Lancaster State Prison.</br></br>

I haven’t got sick over the above, it’s just being around germs and other sicknesses stresses you a bit. I stay concentrating on the Bible because it’s the only way. I’m about to write me a book as soon as I get all my materials to start. I’m pretty good in writing as you see.</br></br>

I truly believe that corona was sprayed in the air and it traveled over the world, it’s airbound. I truly appreciate you writing to me, hope we can be friends and write more after. If you need more information please contact me.</br></br>

Stay sweet.
