This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Soledad.</br></br>Hello PPP,</br></br>

It was nice to hear from you and a little interesting. As you already know, I am object to COVID-19 as are you out there.</br></br> 

There has been a constant rise in reported cases here on Central Facility over the course of the last 60 days. This increase is wreaking havoc on the already SNAFU I call another day in the penitentiary.</br></br> 

I work as assignment in the PIA, but since June, I may have worked about a month. Whenever a case is reported within a housing unit, that unit is quarantined for 14 days. I believe it was the second week of November this unit reported a case. The unit was slammed, locked down. I haven’t been out since then. Meals are brought to the door, showers available every third day, two persons per shower room.</br></br> 

I‘ve been to the yard once. The last scheduled yard period was cancelled (SNAFU). Unfortunately, that was the one opportunity this month to purchase canteen. During the quarantine period, reports of positive test result were had as they’re testing the unit about every five days. As of today, some guys were called to their PIA assignment. How long before I return who knows.</br></br> 

I’m in the middle of preparing for a board hearing next year so, I’m staying focused on the prep work, correspondence course, independent study, etc. This keeps the mind positive. Sad to say, but I am a long-time resident of the CDCR so, I’ve learned to not develop a sense of entitlement, even about the lawful entitlements.</br></br> 

I know how CDCR operates and I am doing all that I can do to prepare myself for release.</br></br> 

COVID is restricting prisoners just as it does to citizens out there. Stay in your space as much as possible. Fortunately, I’m alone in this small place, allowing me to maintain some distance from others. My program has changed where I do not go to work, no leisure group participation, yard, canteen but, I don’t stress on it all.</br></br> 

My focus is being prepared for release. COVID is just another factor that prisoners have no control of. I don’t stress about things I have no control of. Well PPP, I am not sure whether or not I’ve informed your curiosities but, if not, get back to me about any specifics, the peaks your interest and I will attempt to provide some feedback.</br></br> 

Thank you for displaying some interest about the wellness of the incarcerated. I don’t know where you’ve gotten my contact info from, but feel free to communicate anytime. Until, I hope that you remain safe in all the chaos.</br></br> 

Peace out.
