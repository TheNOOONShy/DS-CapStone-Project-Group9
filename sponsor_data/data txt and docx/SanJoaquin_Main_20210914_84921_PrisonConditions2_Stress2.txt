This story was told by a person incarcerated at San Joaquin County Jail.</br></br>

Caller: Now then, once again bringing me back to this moment with me reading out my story in front of these men, about one or two of them – about one or two each of them from the various groups throughout the jail, all of them very committed to their cause, and I began telling them how in the past I basically jumped around from what's considered from one gang to another as well as the fact that I'm also mixed race – of mixed race now running as the strongest man with the whites, and I also eat food even if a black man touched it, I'm breaking all their rules.</br></br>


And I could see the – I could see as their eyes are growing wider and wider with every word I said, some of them having now even jumped out of their chairs and running around saying things like, oh, hell, no. Oh, hell, no. As they would then sit back down and try to explain to me all the rules I was breaking and what the consequences would now be, even though I already knew. I slowly calmed them all down little by little explaining to them it's now better for them to – to not – it's now better for them to not be hypocrites as they sit here attending to this bible study every night trying to better understand what God wants from them.</br></br>


I then went on to ask them to imagine if they're – the love of Jesus was sitting there in jail with them. Well – well, then how would they expect him to act? And would he then fall in line with all the jail politics or would he then blaze his own trail in fighting for what he knows to be true by telling them that all men are equal with love and compassion and that it's better to live in harmony with one another rather than to continue the practice of this segregation?</br></br>


Well, slowly but surely they all then stood up at the table in unison telling me how much courage it must have just taken for me to have this conversation with them and telling me that I'm a better man than they are, and with this – and with this moment forward, and especially with what I just told them all, that they would all stand together and protect me and make sure that no harm comes – ever comes my way.</br></br>


And with that, same as in a cage fight, having a superior intellect is oftentimes your best weapon in being able to sometimes see three or four moves ahead of what's to come, knowing what your opponent will do – do next before they even do; therefore, in times where it may have seemed like you just made yourself vulnerable, that you may have instead asserted a tactical calculated risk to achieve your desired outcome whereas in a – this cage – whereas in this cause – case – excuse me – whereas in this case, I wanted nothing more than to change the – these men from within, to change the course of who they are, even forcing them to feel as if they had come up with it on – the idea on their own.</br></br>


Inception works that is the best – inception – inception works the best for helping a person make changes in themselves that can then last a lifetime. Doing something like this can take a lot of courage. And when it comes to guts, well, I've got all the guts and glory. I thrive on glory. Glory is often what motivates me and also feels great to look back on. And that's the end.
