This letter was written from a person incarcerated at Solano.</br></br>

To begin, I work in the prisons optical shop where we produce glasses for medical patients and state prison inmates. Throughout this entire pandemic PIA administrators did what they could to keep it running even during the time of the stay-at-home order called by Governor Newsom. It is clearly obvious that their desire for the mighty dollar trumped the health and safety of inmate workers. In spite of lingering effects of my recent traumatic experiences along with my debilitating pre-COVID medical conditions, I'm being forced to work.</br></br>
 
In spite of lingering effects of my recent traumatic experiences along with my debilitating pre-COVID medical conditions, I'm being forced to work.I'm being threatened by supervisory staff with receiving disciplinary actions should I fail to show up for work. This reflects how insignificant my health is to the business. Daily pressure is placed on us workers to wear N95 masks however staff had a care-free attitude about keeping their own masks on. It is well-known that the only way Solano prison inmates would get infected was by way of staff.</br></br>
 
Initially, I personally did not mind working during COVID because I believed I was helping fellow Californians be able to see. I did what I could to stay COVID-free; wore a mask, washed hands frequently, and stayed six feet apart when possible. Today, I don't feel comfortable or safe anymore.</br></br>
 
In the housing units, it can hold up to 256 inmates and typically we have approximately 210 inmates. Sometime around May of 2020, each building removed 12 double bunked beds (every bed is double-bunk) and the number of inmates remained 180-190. I mention this as we have been over-crowded at Solano prison since my arrival in spite of the Federal 3 Judge panels order to reduce all prison populations.</br></br>
 
It is physically impossible to socially distance. Having a bunkmate means our faces are only three feet apart separated only by a slat or sheetmetal which the top bunk man sleeps on. When he coughs, sneezes or drops something from the top bunk, it comes down onto the bottom bunk leading to eventual spread of infection. This certainly does not make me feel safe health-wise or protected in my bed area.</br></br>
 
Additionally, when we went to sit at a table in the dayroom to do schoolwork, write letters, or hobby, the metal tables are not sanitized regularly or when done, not properly. The same foes for our dining tables in the chowhall. While we been instructed to sit two to a table, socially distancing is not feasible due to overcrowding. When seated across from one another, we are only three feet apart, not six. The next table behind, in front of, and across from where I sit at puts that inmate only three feet away as well. Not a conducive environment for remaining COVID-free.
