Dear PrisonPandemic,</br></br>

Let me begin by thanking your team for caring enough to show us that are in prison, that you all care about all of us. I truly can’t say enough how happy I truly feel about the caring words that were in your letter. Well, I am a Black male that will soon turn 60 years young. I truly don't look or feel that young.</br></br> 

I've been down for 16 years, which is a long time but I am being told that I'll been look at in 2025 to be released.</br></br>

Thank God, I am from CA, but I've been all over Cali. I was told that in early December, that I had COVID, which was bad. I found it hard to breath and I also had a cough that really was bad. I was sick, with bones ache, headaches.</br></br> 

My chest was so sore that I had to use an inhaler to breath.</br></br>

I lost all taste, and smell for about two months which was bad. I just got my taste and smell back. I can say that I was taken care of as long as I told medic what I needed. I am now about 95 percent better, being locked up which was all my fault.</br></br>

It is always hard to be away from your loved one, but you have to stay strong, and smart on how you care yourself. Only because if you show weakness, you’ll be used, which is crazy. I am very safe, because I show all that I don't wish for problems. But you would not want them either, so I am safe so far, thank God.</br></br> 

Visits, well it is truly hard because we are now given video visits which are for 30 minutes, which is better than none at all.</br></br>

Well, I have been in places where there was a lot of stabbing such as High Desert. But here, is better as far as doing time, but I've never been where it gets hot, as in 120 degree. I hate it here, but I have to stay out of trouble which isn't hard at all.</br></br> 

All my loved ones are up north, in the Bay Area and Sacramento. Daughter lives in New York, so I have to wait anyway. Sorry for my penmanship. What is best, just asking. Thank you and stay safe.</br></br>

God bless all.
