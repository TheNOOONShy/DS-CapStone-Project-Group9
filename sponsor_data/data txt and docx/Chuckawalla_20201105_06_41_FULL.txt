This story was told by a person incarcerated at Chuckawalla.</br></br>

Caller: I'm at Chuckawalla State Prison.</br></br>UCI: Oh, okay. Cool.</br></br>Caller: It's a level two facility dormitory setting.</br></br>UCI: A level two? Awesome. Chuckawalla. Okay. Awesome. So what is - what are the current conditions of COVID at your prison?</br></br>Caller: Right now we're at six deaths and we went up from six positives to 191 within a month and a half.</br></br>UCI: Wow.</br></br>Caller: We are skyrocketing back up. And there's an outbreak in D facility and in C facility.</br></br>UCI: Wow. So in a month and a half. So can you give me a rough estimate of when that month started and is it in October, is it recently?</br></br>Caller: October.</br></br>UCI: It's October?</br></br>Caller: In October, yes.</br></br>UCI: Is there anything that's concerning you - I mean, obviously, you know, the pandemic, but is there anything that's going on that's concerning you about how the prison has been handling all the outbreaks?</br></br>Caller: The outbreaks were very - they were scary. I didn't…</br></br>
UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>Caller: - my wife or my mom and my loved ones, of course, but when it first…</br></br>UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>Caller:	- through in March, they were mixing the yards from A yard to B yard</br></br> UCI: Hmm.</br></br>Caller: - yard and we went from having no positive to the whole yard being infected. It was just - it's the flu on steroids. I love my taste buds for two weeks and -</br></br> UCI: Wow.</br></br>Caller: - for the…</br></br>UCI: You tested positive?</br></br>Caller: I tested positive.</br></br>UCI: Okay.</br></br>Caller: And I've tested twice already negative.</br></br>UCI: Good.</br></br>Caller: The only symptoms I got, I was fatigue and I lost my tastebuds for two weeks. But administration, they - they're still not taking it serious. They mixed up the yards, they mixed up the buildings. Right now everybody is healthy and strong in our building. We just recently had B3 quarantined because two inmates already tested positive once again. One works in the kitchen. And I haven't been in the kitchen since March because that's where everybody has been getting sick.</br></br>UCI: Is that where you used to work?</br></br>Caller: No, no, no. I -</br></br> UCI: Okay.</br></br>Caller: - here in the yard, but everybody that's gotten sick has come out of the kitchen, so -</br></br> UCI: Interesting.</br></br>Caller: I have not been in there to eat. I just go get my lunch. I stay away from the kitchen. But administration, they don't take it serious. They don't wear their mask. Inmates don't wear their mask. You have officers letting inmates go out to yard to play sports and mixing up with the other yards.</br></br>And they're cross-contaminating still. The PSR says we're not supposed to mix. We're not supposed to be with any building. We're supposed to be kept away under escort if another building's out. They have no regard. We have inmates coming in our building from other buildings, and we don't know if they're carrying anything or they're got sick or whatever. One of them was the program office clerk and his cube got quarantined. One of them tested inconclusive and he's coming in all the buildings. So they're -</br></br> UCI: Hmm.</br></br>Caller: - they're not taking anything here. They want to come to work. It's -</br></br> UCI: Yeah.</br></br>Caller: Yeah, they're trying to open us more program and they can't contain the situation right now, so I - I actually --</br></br>UCI: The -</br></br>Caller: - stopped playing sports just so I don't hang around with too many people now.</br></br>UCI: Do you find that a majority of prisoners are also concerned or - I'm sorry - your peers are also concerned or do you find that more of your peers are kind of leaning towards the side of not taking it seriously?</br></br>I mean, how are your feelings with the facility and the overall general vibe of the facility?</br></br>Caller: I basically feel that it's every person's responsibility to take it serious. Like I –</br></br>UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>Caller: - my wife and kids since March. And I'm a lifer that's been incarcerated for 30 years and I'm trying to get a parole date in my advancement, but I don't want to get sick again. So it's kind of - it's kind of a betting that no one's taking it serious because they're, like, well, you're not sick.</br></br>Nobody's sick. I go, it doesn't matter. You're still accountable. You're - you're making a choice to constantly not walk around with your mask on. And they blame the officer for bringing it to us, yet you're at the podium and you're hanging out with them without your mask. So you're the blame.</br></br>UCI: Yeah. So you said that your - everyone no matter what, you know, position you hold, has to wear a mask; is that correct?</br></br>Caller: They tell us to wear the mask, but at the end of the day, to be brutally honest, like, everybody has the mask around their neck. And when they talk to an officer they'll pull it above their face or administration's walking they pull it on their face and wear it accordingly. But nobody is wearing their masks the way they're supposed to. The officers have it around their neck. They - it - it's just - we're not going to get better if they don't take it serious.</br></br>UCI: Yeah. I - and I can imagine that coping inside the facility with many other individuals from your viewpoint aren't taking it seriously. Is there anything - I mean, you said you don't go to the kitchen anymore. You don't play sports anymore. Is there a differencing of opinions on how to cope with the pandemic from facility to facility, from, you know, different parts of the in - the institution?</br></br>Caller: Well, it - it just kind of doesn't make sense because you have a yard that's healthy and then they're bringing inmates from reception now. We receive…</br></br> UCI: Oh, okay.</br></br>Caller: We got some from Tracy and we got some Wasco. So they're bringing these non-infected inmates or potentially infected inmates to our yard, and basically everybody is apprehensive and unknown and - it - we kind of, like, put our guard up does he got it? Does he not? And basically they feel outcasted because we basically know who's in our environment and now you're bringing somebody new.</br></br>Is he going to get us sick? Is he going to get us sick? Is he going to get the building quarantined? So a lot of anxiety and frustration built up. And then people haven't seen their family or loved ones, so it's just accumulation of things on stress. Like, it's on somebody's shoulders.</br></br>UCI: Yeah. Absolutely. Build-up of stress. You said you haven't seen your family since March? Is that when they locked down everything or - they took away your visitation? Okay.</br></br>Caller: Yeah, took everything. I was expecting a family visit, as a matter of fact, with my two daughters and my wife, and we weren't allowed to get it because of the pandemic.</br></br>UCI: That's - and how has your family been coping with that? Are you still allowed - I mean, are you still allowed phone calls on a regular basis? Kind of -</br></br> Caller: Oh, yeah.</br></br>UCI: - describe that.</br></br>Caller: I - I call them every day, but, I mean, they have their meltdowns. They're coping with it best they can. Knock on wood, none of my family members have gotten sick from it. My wife and my mother-in-law, my - my nieces, my nephews, my grandkids, they're all taking precautions now to get it and I've been really blessed. None of them have got it. Just me. But they - they have had their meltdowns because they haven't seen me. So it - it's stressful for the kids, too. Like my grandkids, I haven't been able to enjoy them or bond with them or see them.</br></br>And my - my kids have not missed a weekend since I've been incarcerated. This is the longest period they've been without seeing me. Even my wife. So it's tooken a big toll.</br></br>UCI: Yeah. And you said in the beginning that you don't tell your family what's going on inside the facility; right?</br></br>Caller: Well, when I got sick I didn't want to worry my wife. And she noticed it, like, what was wrong, and I didn't tell her.</br></br>I told her I felt tired and I was taking, like, two or three naps a day and finally I - I lost my tastebuds and she goes, are you sure you're all right? I said, yeah. Once I got my tastebuds back and we tested, she's, like, you're going to end up testing. I go, I know, I'm going to be negative. She said what? And that's when she panicked. So I had to tell her and my mom…</br></br> UCI: Hmm.</br></br>Caller: - going on. I just didn't want them worrying because people are dying and I - I didn't need them having an added stress to worry about me being sick or where it was going to go.</br></br>UCI: Absolutely.</br></br>Caller: Of course, like everybody else I just manned up and didn't go, but it was…</br></br>UCI: Yeah.</br></br>Caller: - horrible experience. Like, it was bad.</br></br>UCI: Absolutely. And you said they're shuffling people from, you know, A, B, C. Would you explain - would you elaborate on that for me why are they shuffling people around?</br></br>Caller: Well, in theory, they feel that if they remove the positives from the building, the people that are negative won't get sick.</br></br>But what they still don't understand is at the end of the day, that whole building is going to get sick.</br></br>UCI: Hmm.</br></br>Caller: They just leave everybody where they're at, quarantine the whole building, let them ride the wave out. But they're mixing up - what they don't understand is they're testing these dudes, they test negative, then they move them from B yard to A yard, then they test them a week or two later, then they're positive. Now they got moved to another building, another yard, now they infected somebody else.</br></br>UCI: Yeah.</br></br>Caller: Like this virus is - is airborne. It's, like, really easy to catch. You could hug somebody and get it. Like, it's really bad. And the -</br></br>UCI: Yeah.</br></br>Caller: - dormitory setting and recycled air, so they're not opening up -</br></br> UCI: Okay.</br></br>Caller: - doors to circulate new air. It's just -</br></br> UCI: That's interesting.</br></br>Caller: - [unintelligible] air. And it's eight people to cubes. So we're - we're like shoulder to shoulder.</br></br>UCI: That's so interesting. Well, as far as testing people go, are you seeing that they're testing people maybe a little bit too late?</br></br>As you said, you know, they'll test negative, and then they get moved, and then all of a sudden they're positive, so do you feel like their testing of individuals is too late or too premature and then they don't catch it?</br></br>Caller: Well, right now they're just doing tests at random.</br></br>UCI: Okay.</br></br>Caller: So they might call ten people per building, and if one of them persons tests positive, then they remove their whole cube, which is eight people, and place them in ad seg.</br></br>Which they're penalizing that cube and they're penalizing that person. They have a machine that they put out there for administration called a Sofia machine, which gives you the results like within two or three minutes.</br></br>UCI: Really?</br></br>Caller: So that's what they - the officers say because the officers allegedly are getting tested every two weeks and that machine tells them if they're positive or negative right there.</br></br>UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>Caller: So my whole thing is if they know that an inmate is going to test, why aren't they using that machine for the inmates, leaving them on the yard before bringing them back in the building and just quarantining that one individual rather than making everybody uncomfortable.</br></br>Like you shouldn't get punished for being sick and our - you need me to call you back again to finish this or -</br></br> UCI: No. No, no, no. You are more than welcome to call back.</br></br>Caller: Okay.</br></br>UCI: I am - I'm going to - we're going to switch people, so I would call back -</br></br> Caller: Okay.</br></br>UCI: - maybe in about six minutes or so. But it's been so great to talk to you. Thank you so much for calling. I appreciate it.</br></br>Caller: And I will give the information out so you can get more stories from people so they could circulate and call.</br></br>UCI: Thank you so much. You have a great night.</br></br>Caller: No, hey, you, too. Be safe. Stay COVID free. Thank you.</br></br>UCI: Thank you. Bye.
