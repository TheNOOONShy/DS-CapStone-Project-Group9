This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Jamestown.</br></br>

Since this epidemic hit in March of last year, I've probably taken more than 15 tests; testing me for COVID-19. Each time I receive a piece of paper with negative results. And the paper is just becoming more clutter with all the rest of the paper being swapped around here by this institution.</br></br>

My job assigned is being a kitchen worker. My job assignment is considered as a critical work as well as those who work along with me in the kitchen.</br></br>

At the Sierra Conservation Center, which is what we all refer to as Jamestown, has three yards: I'm on the A side, also called Calervaras. On this side, it's mostly level one inmates who will soon be, if not already, eligible to go to camp.</br></br>

There are a few lifers who will soon be suitable to be released into society, who are on this yard, but not so many. On the B side, which is where most inmates are level two is also called Mariposa.</br></br>

There are more lifers there because most of them have received many years. The last yard is the C yard, called Tuolome. This yard is where the segregated housing unit is held and the SNY (Sensitive Need Yard) is.</br></br>

To make a long story short, damn near all of Mariposa B side was infected with the virus. Those that were older and at risk were moved to the segregation unit that is on the Tuolome C side.</br></br>

Individual who work in the kitchen such as myself, were working up to 16 hours a day. And getting threatened with disciplinary actions if they took any days off meaning: they- we worked seven days a week.
