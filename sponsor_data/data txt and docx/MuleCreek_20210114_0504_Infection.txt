This story was told by a person incarcerated at Mule Creek.</br></br>

UCI: What would make the situation at your facility better? Just like training for the staffers? Or do you guys need any other sort of help?</br></br> Caller: Yeah, staff to have the correct training on what to do and for staff to have repercussions if they don’t follow the rules. ‘Cause like we gotta follow rules, they should have to follow the rules too.</br></br>UCI: And how have you or other inmates been coping with all of this? Are you guys able to have like, at least help inside? Or is there anything that you can do to alleviate the stress?</br></br>Caller: Well like I’m CCCMS, and I’ve put in numerous requests to talk to my clinician and I still haven’t been able to talk to him. Before I put it in, I had to put it in like five or six times and then my clinician will finally come out and talk to me. But I put in like, multiple requests tryin’ to get to talk to him about what I’m going through and stuff like that and I haven’t been able to see nobody.</br></br> And then like I said with this broken ankle I got on the 9th, I’m still waiting for surgery, the hospital told me I needed emergency surgery, like right away and today’s the 14th and I still haven’t had surgery. And I put in multiple requests to medical and they still won’t respond back.
