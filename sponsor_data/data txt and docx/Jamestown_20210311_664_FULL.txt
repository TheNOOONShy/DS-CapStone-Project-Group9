Greetings! To you and your colleagues!! I hope you all are feeling tremendous today. Anyways…</br></br>

I received your short letter dated on Feb. 2021, pertaining to the pandemic and how it’s affected us all as prisoners. Well I just wanted to say thank you for taking the time to reach out, I do appreciate and support what you guys are doing at UCI.</br></br>

So yeah, I don’t mind sharing a lil about my personal experience during these difficult times. To begin with, it has been overwhelming. Stressful some days due to catching COVID-19.. Even though I’m vigorous, the virus physically ran me down for a bit. I experienced mostly all symptoms, so it was frustrating.</br></br>

I’m feeling much better now, testing negative. I didn’t take the vaccine because I felt it was too soon. Plus, since I’ve caught it, my body has the antibodies to fight it. Hearing rumors, for instance like, it would make you sterile.</br></br>

I was like, I’m cool, I don’t know. Maybe in the future. If anything, I’m more concerned about my family’s safety. Wondering if they’re ok, see them, or if they’re financially struggling to make ends meet. I’m unfortunate to be unable to get visits due to work schedules and long travel distance. But I don’t get discouraged, even though it would be nice once in a while.</br></br>

My main goal in here is to stay focused, take advantage of positive programs, education, looking forward to coming home soon. But due to the pandemic, everything is placed on hold (programs) till further notice.</br></br>

So the way I’ve been coping with this crisis is reaching out to family and friends, devoting my time to working out, studying, reading interesting books, drawing, and listening to music. That’s pretty much it, everything else I leave it on god’s hands.</br></br>

Well I hope this gives you an insight on the perspective of an inmate serving time. Thank you sincerely.
