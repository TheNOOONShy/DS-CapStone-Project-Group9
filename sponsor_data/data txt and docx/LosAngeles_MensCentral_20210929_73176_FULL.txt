This story was told by a person incarcerated at Los Angeles County Men's Central Jail.</br></br>

Caller: Since I've been here, I had an 83-year-old guy that was next door to me, and they called him out. He came out positive for COVID. I never seen him again.</br></br>

Found out he died. Died in the hospital over here. Since I've been here, during this COVID, my father, who was doing life in prison in [redacted], he got COVID. He almost died from it and he's still suffering from complications from it.</br></br>

I've lost my uncle to COVID since I've been here. Right now, I can't even call my family. My mother's got cancer.</br></br>

My sister, she's going through breast cancer and chemo right now. I can't call her. I don't have no family support at all.</br></br>

I came down positive with COVID in here. The only thing they did with me is take me to the hospital over here at - next to the county jail. The only thing they did for me is give me aspirin.</br></br>

So, I sat there and suffered the whole time. Since I've been here too in this county jail during this COVID I - I have post-traumatic stress syndrome. I'm not supposed to be isolated like this.</br></br>

And - the the psychiatrist came and talked to me. Gave me the wrong medication that almost killed me, dropped my blood pressure so low that I fell out of my cell, cracked the back of my head open.</br></br>

And now I'm scared to even take the medication here because these nurses here in the - they don't care about us. They just use us for guinea pigs, pretty much. I haven't had a hot meal in here in three years.</br></br>

The dinner that we get in here is the only hot meal that we have in here and it's always served ice cold. I mean, I mean, come on, you know, this is - this is unhumane.</br></br>

Then I'm being labeled my crime in here. I have a high-profile case.</br></br>

UCI: I'm sorry to hear that so much is going on in your facility. But that's exactly what our project is here for. We want to bring this stuff to light. And I'm curious what the vaccination process has been at your facility?</br></br>

Caller: Okay, yeah. They came around with it and they offered it to us. At first I didn't want to take it because I was real skeptical of it. Like a lot of people are thinking it changes your DNA, and then you know, all this other stuff that's supposed to be going on, thinking it's the mark of the beast and all this stuff. But they come by and finally offered it to us.</br></br>

When I took it, the first shot, you know, it was kind of painful after, and then the second shot was a little worse. And my dad was saying the same thing over there where he's at. He said that the - the second shot made him real sick.</br></br>

He's still - it's been like probably months now since he's taken that second - second shot and he's still having pains in his chest and in his kidneys, he said. So, yeah, there's a lot of people skeptical about it.</br></br>

UCI: Okay, I see. And how often are you - are the people in your facility being offered the vaccine?</br></br>

Caller: Since I've been here, I've seen them come around like twice.</br></br>

UCI: Have they come around recently?</br></br>

Caller: No. Not recently, no.</br></br>

UCI: Okay. And how has your COVID situation in your facility affected your loved ones?</br></br>

Caller: I haven't talked to - I have an eight-year-old daughter out there. I haven't talked to her in three years. And I've been - and since I've been in here, I hadn't, like I was saying, my uncle in [redacted] died from COVID.</br></br>

So, it's affected our family a lot. It's affected me real bad because it's put a lot of stress on me worrying about my 78-year-old father who has just - who just had like three major heart attacks in the last probably year now.</br></br>

And since he's had like a bad heart, he's got emphysema, the vaccine really affected him real hard. He's still having like health problems over it.</br></br>

So you know like we were kind of thinking what's going on with this vaccine? A lot of people were thinking that, like you know the long-term effects of it. They don't trust it.</br></br>

UCI: Right. And have you noticed reduced visitation and programming since the pandemic began?</br></br>

Caller: Ma'am, I've been in isolation for three years here in this LA county jail. I only get an hour of TV time a week out in the TV room by myself. And I don't get no other interaction at all with the other inmates.</br></br>

I haven't even seen a pastor or chaplain on this row in months. So, there's like no religious support in here. There's nothing new.</br></br> 

We don't get to see our families. The mail only gets passed out to us once a week back here. So, yeah, you know, it's real stressful on us inmates.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, considering how secluded you are how have you been coping with the crisis?</br></br>

Caller: How am I coping with it? I don't have no choice. I'm in isolation. I'm sitting here plugging out of my mind right now, you know?</br></br>

Since, I can't call my family. I don't have no support whatsoever. The only one that I-</br></br>

UCI: Are you there?</br></br>

Caller: You know like a lot of the checks and stuff like that. And us inmates in here, you know, we should get them too.</br></br>

UCI: I'm sorry. Can you repeat that last - can you repeat that last sentence that you said?</br></br>

Caller: Sure. I said like a lot of people out there are getting the stimulus checks. You know, you know like to help them, but people in here, inmates, they don't have family support and can't get the stimulus checks. You know, I feel that we should be able to get one too because we're - we're in here going through it too.</br></br>

UCI: Right.</br></br>

Caller: You know like people in here like me, who don't have family support, we can't buy like, you know like, stationary, hygiene articles, and stuff like that.</br></br>

UCI: And are you being given the correct like sanitation or masks or PPE while you're incarcerated at the moment?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah. They - when I go to court they make me wear a mask. And then when I come out of the - I only get to come out of my cell just to go to the TV room once a week.</br></br>

And usually I haven't bothered with a mask because it's just me. I'm just walking by myself down the hallway escorted by a - by a deputy. Then they throw me in the TV room by myself.</br></br>

And other than that, I don't have no other contact with the inmates or anything like that. Like all my meals come to me in my cell. They got a shower in my cell.</br></br>

I'm in a single cell all by myself. The telephone gets rolled to me. Like right now I'm talking through a tray slot in my door to you. The telephone is like outside of the door.</br></br>

UCI: Okay.</br></br>

Caller: And I've seen quite a few people in here die. You know that really hit me hard when that 83-year-old guy that was next to me died. Like he waved to me bye. He told me that he felt fine and I never seen him again.</br></br>

And I found that he died in the hospital from COVID. So, that really - really hit us real hard back here because we just really liked that little guy, you know little peppy little Jewish guy. Really cool little guy.</br></br>

UCI: And are you guys aware of the general–</br></br>

Caller: That guy was a cool guy.</br></br>

UCI: I'm sorry. Repeat what you were going to say.</br></br>

Caller: I said that the little old man that was next to me, he was 83 years old, so we all kind of liked him. He was a little diamond broker. Had really cool stories and stuff.</br></br>

So, when you're back here in isolation, like I am, and that's all you got to talk to, you grow real attached to the person, you know? And then when I never seen him again, I found out that he died from - from COVID. It really hit me hard.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, I can imagine that being your - one of your only sources of coping through the crisis.</br></br>

Caller: We have each other, you know, when we don't have no family support or nothing like that. Like at the same time this was going on, back in November 2018, they had that California fire growing, and my grandparents and my - my aunts lived up there.</br></br>

And at the same as this was - that was going on my mother found out I was in here and it was just so much stress on her that it gave her a heart attack and it killed my mom. So, you know that was real stressful on me. I had to go through that in here too.</br></br> 

Then we had the mum - outbreak of mumps in here. So, yeah, it's get's pretty bad. And then, you know we don't get our cells cleaned out every day like we should.</br></br>

I'm lucky if I get my cell cleaned out, like mopped, you know where they - like maybe once a week. So, yeah it's pretty unsanitary. This whole jail is so - so nasty that they're supposed to be tearing it down, I hear.</br></br>

UCI: And are you aware of the general population's experience with COVID, or is your knowledge kind of focused mainly just on people that are in solitary, the people that you have seen?</br></br>

Caller: Well, well I've - well, from what I've seen like when I was like talking about that little man that died from COVID, it hit us all real hard because everybody on my row was back here like, you know they liked him. So, it hit us real hard, and a lot of people were stressing over their families getting it and not trusting the vaccines. I would see deputies walking around in here with no mask on like they don't care.</br></br>

UCI: Right. And is your neighbor the only person that you're aware of catching COVID in your row?</br></br>

Caller: I've caught it myself in here.</br></br> 

UCI: And how was your experience–</br></br>

Caller: Quite a few people - How was my experience? They took me over to the - they put me in a cell by myself and the only thing they did for me is give me aspirin.</br></br>

UCI: And they didn't check on you?</br></br>

Caller: They don't - they don't - ma'am, I'm like the biggest piece of crap to 'em in here. You know I'm in here with [redacted].</br></br>

And then I got a high-profile case, like I was saying too. And so, they look at me like I'm crap. They don't care about us in here.</br></br>

You - that 83-year-old man, he told us bye. He said he felt fine. They walked him out to the hospital and I never seen him again.</br></br>

And then when like I told you when they gave me the wrong medication in here too. Like this was back in March and I hit my head. They - you know they give us the wrong medication in here.</br></br>

It takes months to see a doctor in here. It's pretty bad. And like I said too, like you know like we're going through this too, and we don't even get a hot meal back here.</br></br>

When we get our meal it sits in the hallway and it's ice cold when we get it. You know ACLU or somebody like that should come in here and investigate this.</br></br>

UCI: Right. And we hope that putting these -</br></br>

Caller: I wish they'd do that.</br></br>

UCI: stories up, helps you guys get that.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah no, I hope something gets done. I remember you know, like I'll be 55. I can remember coming through here when I was a kid in the 80s. It was - it was real bad.</br></br>

You know, the cops in here used to beat us down with flashlights. And now they got cameras everywhere and stuff, so they don't get away with it like they used to. So, I'm glad to see that change in here.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, that's good to hear.
