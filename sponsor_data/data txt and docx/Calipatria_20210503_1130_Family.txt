If I had to say, that’s what it feels like, the first week the news hit I had just proposed to my fiance. Imagine that a week later we are being told we can not see eachother to futher notice and all of a sudden it all comes crashing down. The very next thing was the tissue shortage, you think people outside of prison had it tough imagine not have none at all.</br></br>
 
Safe to say me and my celly at the time had one roll to last us two weeks it wasn’t easy but we made it possible. Just when you think everything will be ok we had an outbreak, it was about six month into the pandemic. No more yard, showers on hold, phone calls limited and dayroom cancelled. What did I do?</br></br>
 
I have already been sentenced why am I being punished. That was the feeling. Will I make it out? I wonder if my family is ok, that was the thoughts.</br></br>
 
I guess all we could do now is pray and watch the news eventually someone donated mask and that was very nice of them however the spread was not slowing. Eventually we all heard someone died and you think it is real. The only thing I could do is write home as much as possible, I worked out to stay healthy and I did not eat much of the food I did not know what to think.</br></br>
 
The extra packages each quarter was a huge help allowed me to have food and be ok. Not seeing the family has no form of expression. It is the hardest thing to deal with everyday walking up not being there because I am here, now I can not even see my family at all.</br></br>
 
Coping was not easy I just kept busy. Self help classes, college courses, reading and learning about stocks anything to keep my mind off of reality. Then someone close to you dies and you hear your family has caught it including your father and you feel helpless. What would you do?</br></br>
 
What could you do? That’s what I did. I prayed harder and kept my faith finally the vaccine was ready but you have to watch that because you don’t know what may actually happen to us if we take it. That is how I felt although I never caught COVID-19 I decided to take the Moderna vaccine and that was a better safe than sorry choice.</br></br>
 
Now I am getting ready to see my fiancé 15 months later and it’s a blessing. She made it. I made it we made it. This is the Third week visitation has been open and an hour isn’t long but it is worth every minute.</br></br>
 
I hear we can only hug and then no touching plus we have to test before and after the visit. I think things are starting to get better and I am still praying for other people because everyone didnt make it but I am thankful we did.</br></br>
 
To Whom it may concern stay blessed, stay positive, stay focused and dedicated. #PeaceAndBlessings #WordsAreRich
