Solom,</br></br> 

Time sensitive, tonight PBS news hour showed a segment on people with - CFS Chronic Fatigue Syndrome - with an affected person describing the condition, which is similar to COVID-19 survivors that have similar symptoms, that will be diagnosed as CFS after six months of persistence. The point is I am a Gulf War vet - and we have chronic fatigue syndrome also - so here it is.</br></br>

Vaccines are good for people. However congressionally directed research has uncovered alterations in genetic expression, due to multiple vaccines are carrier fluid that is a cause of genetic polymorphisms. The research advisory committee on Gulf War Veterans illness suggested using saline fluid nasal flooding and there have been at least one clinical trial with limited results from specific saline on specific DNA.</br></br>

I used this saline from OTC onsite, and I might be the first vet to recover from CFS. (My saline was not acknowledged despite good results). I have mailed you a label already, the point of this letter is the PBS story mentioned CFS and COVID survivors are same diagnosis as Gulf vets.</br></br> 

Here is tricky part - don't panic public. Vaccines of the past affect COVID survivors that did not get COVID vaccine, because they will live with symptoms due to past genetic alterations from vaccines of past. People that have gotten COVID vaccine and have rare blood clots it's because past and present carries fluid for COVID-19 and whatever past flu shots.</br></br> 

Even if one person dies from a million vaccinated there are several that will live with chronic fatigue syndrome - thousands of CFS people. It is all DNA specific. So if committees from congress had saline formulas limited trials for specific people and a general suggestion to try saline fluid to hydrolize or remove genetic alterations by unbinding carrier fluid from DNA.</br></br>

Why are they not flooding everybody’s noses that have chronic fatigue syndrome - vaccine related blood clots - neuro inflammations. Because saliva is cheap and harmless. There is a missing link. I personally contacted a committee member trying to share this label and he said. What helps one person might not help others. This is sad logic. Other researchers showed genetic PON 1 enzyme discovery leading other research to exploit genetic manipulation.</br></br> 

Google PON 1 enzyme Gulf War cohort hispanic field workers, I am a Mexican, Irish - broad DNA spectrum. This saline helped my CFS overnite which is believed to be impossible - saline is free here and harmless - miracle remedy being ignored. So people deserve a chance to have at least one professor that will investigate this saline specific formula.</br></br> 

Other saline had limited testing. Why hold out? It’s fuckin saline fluid harmless - cheap. I believe it will erase vaccine damage and remove physiological suppression of thousands of people with chronic fatigue syndrome because I am a Gulf War vet - honorable discharge and it removed my chronic fatigue syndrome. Somebody is hiding something about vaccine side effects because they are observing what genetic suppression makes DNA site stronger over time.</br></br> 

However, the actual suppression itself can only make DNA site stronger by capping site which prevents DNA site enzyme from flowing into bloodstream. Therefore autonic processes are missing enzyme or piece of natural formula. Resulting in haywire CFS symptoms so saliva would uncap DNA site that was suppressed. If suppressed for long time then stronger DNA expression results from saline uncap.</br></br> 

PON 1 enzyme has already been manipulated in hopes of military use. So the government has good people and selfish people. I am a distant relative of Queen Elizabeth and she is trustworthy. She does not know me personally. However she might be suspicious of genetic experiments of Gulf War vets so please send her a copy or post this label.</br></br> 

Because if the public realizes chronic fatigue syndrome could be results of past vaccine side effects they will panic. However this saline solution was dismissed by a committee member, why? I mailed so many labels to VA even Research Advisory Committee on Gulf War Veterans' Illnesses (RACGWVI) who suggested basically any saline - non specific - why the lack of interest.
