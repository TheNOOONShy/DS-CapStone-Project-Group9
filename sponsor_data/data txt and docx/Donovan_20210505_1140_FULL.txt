Dear [redacted],</br></br>


Good day to you!</br></br>


A college student, amen… what is your major?</br></br>


A pleasant surprise receiving your brief note in reply to your inquiry, yes the COVID-19 pandemic was a traumatic shocking World wide scary situation no doubt, a few prisoners died I believe from the virus. I have received both Moderna vaccine shots already as it was a bad position with over 350 inmates infected via test?</br></br>


Everything is going okay now, most all prisoners have been vaccinated.</br></br>


Listen, I am from the Valley area and will be paroled there soon looking for a room to rent, any suggestions you may have would be greatly appreciated in advance?</br></br>


I have a true story, i.e., falsely convicted, exculpatory material evidence was withheld from jurors that need to be re-polled upon my release from custody with a team of lawyers working in my behalf.</br></br>


I realize you stated no legal assistance and I am not asking for any, a friend that will help with positive reforms, absolutely!</br></br>


Looking forward to hearing more from your end, stay in great spirits AA.</br></br>


Sincerely yours.
