This story was told by a person incarcerated at Chuckawalla.</br></br>

Caller: Okay. Well, the virus has broken out over here at this prison.</br></br>In the beginning, staff was very loose and negligent with moving inmates from yard to yard, building to building, quarantine certain inmates with positive - actually quarantine positive inmates with negative inmates at certain times. Then we had started doing temperature checks, vital checks, and as soon as someone had a high fever they would take them to center health.</br></br>Then a couple days - within a couple days of that, they'll bring them back and mix them up with the negative - inmates that have tested negative. So the whole time we have been separated from each building. There's three buildings on the yard. And they quarantine each building by themselves.</br></br>They were doing that for a period of time, and then after like a month or two, then they started letting - no, they started being a little loose with it again and - and letting us go out with other buildings when we weren't supposed to. At times they would wear their mask, at times they wouldn't. They would start enforcing rules and making sure we were six feet apart and doing that social distancing, and then, you know, like I say, you know, then things started getting loose and they'll just let everyone roam around free again. Since then, medical staff hasn't came in the building yet. They'd been doing it about once or twice a month with vital checks and temperature checks.</br></br>As far as testing, just today three block got tested - everybody in building three. There was two confirmed positive cases and earlier in the day they were issued an N95 mask. And four block and five block has yet to be issued N95 mask. We just have face cloths that they gave us about March or April.</br></br>Since then it's been the same. You know, it's just we're - we're still being quarantined from the other buildings. Three block right now is on quarantine, like I said, and they've been - they've been going to yard less and they going to the dining hall less, so they're keeping us away from them. That's pretty much it. It's about the same thing every day, though.</br></br>UCI: Okay. Are you able to recall how the situation was handled at the beginning of the pandemic until now month-by-month?</br></br>Caller: Can you repeat that?</br></br>UCI: Are you able to give a month-by-month recount of the - of how the situation was handled? Do you - do you remember anything else about maybe how it was handled at the beginning, how it's changed now?</br></br>Caller: In the beginning it was crazy. There was just too much moving around.</br></br>It's like putting somebody infected with people that haven't been tested yet or - or haven't been exposed. So what they were doing in the beginning was just very careless. You had A yard with confirmed cases and they brought everybody from A yard to B yard, which made no sense because we weren't even exposed to it until they brought staff and - and other inmates from that yard to - to B yard.</br></br>But it seems like everything they do, whether it be medical wise, whether it be movement, or the way they run the certain programs, it's never the same. CDC switches their mind, you know, from the next minute to the next hour. Nothing is consistent with them.</br></br>UCI: Okay. What would you say is the most troubling thing for you right now in regards to the pandemic?</br></br>Caller: Can you repeat that one more time?</br></br>UCI: What would you say is the most troubling aspect of your situation in regards to the pandemic?</br></br>Caller: At times it is stressful. It's stressful because it doesn't seem like they know - they don't know what to do, and at times I feel like they do things on purpose with movement. Nobody really wants to move, nobody really wants to go to quarantine, nobody wants to go to outside hospital because they say we have -</br></br>- they say we have to quarantine for 14 days before we go to outside medical, go to medical, and then come back and quarantine for another 14 days. Our property gets lost. It's the movement and the way they - they handle the program here at CVSP that makes it a stressful environment. So not only are you threatening us sometimes, sometimes they don't - not - not were physical, but, like, with, well, we're going to move you or you're going to go ad seg or you're going to go to quarantine.</br></br>Your whole group is going to go to quarantine. That right there is a stressful and it creates a stressful environment. And then we, as inmates, you know, you know, have to deal with the correction officers because it's not medical. At the end of the day, it's going to be the correctional officers and it just creates a hostile - hostile environment. So it - it's the movement that we don't like. And to keep moving us just because somebody's sick, it - it creates stress on us.</br></br>And then that's the one thing that we don't like.</br></br>UCI: Okay. So what do you think would make the situation at your facility better?</br></br>Caller: You know, that - that's kind of tough because at any moment - at any moment, somebody could come down real sick and actually, you know, die from it, and it - it has happened. But, you know, they're in - they're in - this whole thing right here, you know, it's just - there's - there's really not much they can do.</br></br>There - there's no cure for it, so to be moving us and to say things, you know, things are better like this if we move you guys and you guys, you know, we understand it - it's an outbreak, there's a virus, it - it's deadly, people have died already, but to make things better, I - I mean, I guess stop - stop movement. And whoever is - is positive would - would have to be moved themselves. Instead of moving, you know, a cube which holds eight and move the whole cube out and they move them back, I mean, that's - I think if it's just the person that - that is positive or maybe has health issues, focus on that person instead of focusing on eight people.</br></br>So that's - that's what I believe.</br></br>UCI: Okay. How have you been coping with the crisis?</br></br>Caller: How - how am I what?</br></br>UCI: How have you been coping with the crisis?</br></br>Caller: I kind of stay in my area or stay away from a grouping. A lot of people that like to group up and, you know, come down here and watch, you know, TV from - from the day room or sit at the table with four or five guys, I try to do three or less and just - just stick to a small crowd.</br></br>I do a lot of writing, read books, or - or go outside and keep - keep my distance. So that's the only way we can cope in here and, you know, get on the telephone and - and talk to our loved ones and see how they're doing out there. There's really not much to do. Just last week we heard that we were going to go back to school, so they're going to open up school and - and behind the wall, which is a vocational trade I'm in - auto mechanics.</br></br>Which I don't understand. That's another thing they do, too, is they start opening up programs and start letting us go about and intermingle with each other, which I don't - I don't know why they do that, so - but that - that's the way I cope with it. So it's not much I can do and I don't really want to put myself through a lot of stress, which we are, but that's - that's a couple ways I cope with it, though.</br></br>UCI: Oh, okay. What's it been like for your loved ones?</br></br>Caller: What - what - say that again?</br></br>UCI: How has the COVID-19 situation at your facility affected your loved ones?</br></br>Caller: They're stressed out, too, because they can't see us. They're always asking if, you know, visitors are going to be - are they coming back and, you know, I mean, that's just basically what it is. It's just the - the non-contact with family, that - that's - I can tell because when I call on the phone, sometimes they're not happy, you know, and maybe it's just because they miss me.</br></br>Or, you know, also got a cousin that's in prison, too, and he - he - he'll be a - he'll be out with - </br></br>
UCI: Please remember that we're not ident - mentioning any identifying information.</br></br>Caller: Okay. Yeah, other than that, you know, it - I mean, all we could do is just, you know, have faith and pray and, you know, just hope for - for the better.</br></br>UCI: Thank you. What else do you want people to know about your experience?</br></br>Caller: There's not much. I mean, I'm young. I'm young, so I'm healthy, so I'm [unintelligible], but you still got a lot of individuals here that are - that are older and that have a health problem, so that's - that's kind of like a - a number one concern with their with mine that, you know, I - I feel for these older gentlemen here that have to go through it, too, with poor medical, you know, and they - they really don't - don't snap to when people, you know, feeling sick, and sometimes that right there takes a toll on us, too, as well because seem like they don't care.</br></br>Not too long ago, maybe like a week ago, a older gentleman really couldn't breathe or had problems with chest pain and I think one of them said, I will take you later. And they took him later. So that was kind of weird, but - sometimes they have an attitude of they don't care or it's not a big deal or we all got it, so who cares. So that's kind of a - it's a - it's a - it's been an experience going - going through this incarcerated.</br></br>It's - I don't think we - none of us would have ever seen this before or even thought it would happen, so that's kind of a - that's kind of a bad experience to go through in here. There's really not much we could do, so that's pretty much it.</br></br>UCI: Okay. Is there anything else that you'd like to say? We have 15 - we have until 15 minutes.</br></br>Caller: Nah, that's pretty much it. Any questions you want to ask.</br></br>UCI: So what is the current COVID-19 situation at your facility?</br></br>Caller: What was that?</br></br>UCI: What's the current situation? Like what's going on, like, right now?</br></br>Caller: They tested three block. They issued 95 - N95 masks.</br></br>They have them on quarantine, they have D nine on quarantine. Other than that, that's pretty much new.</br></br>UCI: Okay. Is there anything else that you'd like to say?</br></br>Caller: No, I think that's pretty much it.</br></br>UCI: Okay. Thank you so much for calling. It's now 7:37 p.m.</br></br>Thank you very much for participating in PrisonPandemic. I'm going to stop this call and recording.</br></br>Caller: All right. Thank you.</br></br>UCI: Thank you.
