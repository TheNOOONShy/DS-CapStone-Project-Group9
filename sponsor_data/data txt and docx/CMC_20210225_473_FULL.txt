This letter was written by a person incarcerated at CMC (California Men's Colony).</br></br>To PrisonPandemic,</br></br> 

Greetings and more love to ya,</br><br/>I’m sitting here pleasantly perplexed, surprised and blessed. I received your letter of encouragement just ten minutes ago and I’ve read it at least four times already. I must thank you for expressing your care to a total stranger, I just love how God works in our lives.</br></br>As for my story, I am a 54 year young lifer whose been incarcerated for 25 straight years. My crime should have sentenced me to 11 years in total but because of the three strikes law enacted in 1994, I was also sentenced to 25 years to life. That’s a total of 36 years to life for a crime that should have sentenced me to 11 years total.</br></br>Since I’ve been incarcerated, I've lost my mother, my father, my brother, and several cousins. On top of all that then comes COVID-19. I stay to myself as much as I can and hardly go outside, a choice of my own. The only way any inmate could ever catch COVID-19 is by way of staff who work in the prison. We haven’t been allowed any visits for at least a year now so how else could we test positive for COVID-19.</br></br> 

Please don’t misunderstand me, I in no way blame any human being for this seriously sad sickness that has plagued our earth. It is what it is sad to say, I also can't wrap my head around the fact that there isn’t yet a vaccine that has been FDA approved, but those of them in power say we must get vaccinated. Here at CMC, medical has been offering vaccination shots to all who will take it.</br></br> 

At the same time, the paper work given to the population about the vaccine clearly states that it is not FDA approved and it also says all the side effects that may happen. It’s all way too much for me, I am a heart patient and I do not play around with medications or my health.</br></br>So I wont take up too much more of your time for now, I'm really happy to now have an outlet to express my thoughts as feelings. Trust me you will hear more for me. I want my story to be an open book for all to see and no, not anonymously. I am and yes, “hear me speak: I want the work to know my story ok.</br></br>I have lots more to say so please be prepared and God bless you.</br></br>Yeah by the way I put everything in God's hands.</br></br>Sincerely your newest friend.
