This story was told by a person incarcerated at Salinas Valley.</br></br>


UCI: Okay, and how has the COVID situation been for them. Please continue.</br></br>


Caller:  Well, the COVID situation goes up and down because staff basically continue to bring the COVID into the house. Also, they don’t really wear their masks -- they wear them on their chin, and they see individuals like that as well, so the COVID situation goes up and down. They might tell you that it’s low, but they lied because they just had issues the other day. But, the thing about that is, I stayed in my room so I don’t, you know, I never received it.</br></br> 


But, what they do, they move inmates from one unit to another, and that is cross, cross-contaminating, you know, the whole thing. That’s how people is getting it. Also, you have staff bringing it in, and they speak with people knowing that they might have it, they might not have it. Then, tomorrow, which is April 22nd, they’re supposed to search the whole unit. Now, that’s dangerous because, for you to have all your officers into a unit search knowing that there’s a chance that these guys have COVID.</br></br>


UCI: Mhm.</br></br>


Caller: But they leave them in their rooms instead of separating them from the GP, you know?</br></br>


UCI: Mhm.</br></br>


Caller: Yeah, I mean, you know, what they’re doing here is very disrespectful. It’s foul, and they’re doing what they do because they feel like they can do it. Staff is bringing in COVID, but then, you know, kids get the temperature thing done. You know, that’s not really saying a person has, well, has it or not, because they can have a low temperature and still have it, you know? So, it’s not good, you know? You know, like I said, they just had a situation the other day where somebody had COVID.</br></br> 


UCI: Mm.</br></br>


Caller: So, you know, all it takes is one person. You know, we don’t use no type of disinfectant at all. They don’t let us use it, nothing like that. So, you know, if you’re trying to stop us from getting it, that’s impossible. You know what I mean? You know, with me, I have issues with breathing, so that’s why I stay in my room. You know, so that’s what’s going on here. Oh, and they’re also transferring people. They transfer them in, they transfer them out. That, that means you don’t know who has it, you know? So, that’s what’s going on in Salinas Valley State Prison.
