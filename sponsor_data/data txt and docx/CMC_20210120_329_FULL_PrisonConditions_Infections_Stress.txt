So I got sick with COVID, coronavirus. I’m okay. Better now. I was working in the main kitchen, 15 to 16 hours, from 4:30 a.m. to 7 p.m. Volunteer and they did the rapid test and I was found having the virus. They do a cotton swab in the nose. Not too pleasant.</br></br>

Anyhow, I’m in quarantine for 14 days restricted. Programs, masks, lockdown, cell confinement. No family visits. Contact is minimal. Six feet and masks. Bleach crews wiping down everything. Jobs stopped. Laundry. Diner. PIA. And quarantined program.</br></br>
 
The loss of contact with has been hard with family and this pandemic. The lockdown caused a stir in these cells. Thank God for TV and programs they do show. The loss of yard is hard for me. It’s part my coping and time management. And since the virus and the program modification time has drug along very slow. Time dreading the days. I run and do bar to work, and since the virus I haven’t been able to.</br></br>
 
All this makes me miss my freedom and makes me think to think on bettering my choices for the future.
