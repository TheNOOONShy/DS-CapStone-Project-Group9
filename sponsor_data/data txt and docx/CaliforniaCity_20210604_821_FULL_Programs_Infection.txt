This story was told by a person incarcerated at California City.</br></br> 

UCI: Great. Okay. So, tell me about your experience with COVID-19.</br></br>

Caller: Man, okay. It was - it was hectic. At first, like we didn't know what was going on, and you start hearing, like, you know, we're locked down.</br></br>

Our normal - our normal program, which means that we come out from like 8:30 to 3:45 - 8:30 a.m. to 3:45 p.m. That's when we come out under normal circumstances. Then we go in for count time to count every inmate.</br></br> 

Then we come out for dinner, and then we come out at night again after dinner from 7:00 to 8:45 p.m. And then we lock it down for the night. That's a normal day for - that's a normal day for, under - that's a normal day for, under normal circumstances.</br></br>

But then with the COVID-19, when everything happened, we started getting less and less programs. They started shortening up our days. And then we started, like, we have to start wearing masks, and we're starting hearing like that people are dying out on the streets.</br></br> 

And we're like, "Whoa. What's going on?" And like we're worried that - that nobody brings it in and stuff. And you know like, there's really no way to bring it in, but eventually people started getting it.</br></br>

They started quarantine us. We started coming out less and less.</br></br>

But it was a very scary experience, knowing that you're locked in the cell and you can't do nothing and you're trapped, because I guess if it's airborne, everybody around you starts getting sick. And - and it's just like you're - you're limited to the time you're going out now.</br></br> 

You're only going out for like an hour a day, two hours a day. And then by the time, that's probably like earlier 2020, March, June. And then by August, probably August-September, we're starting to get less and less time out of, like just wandering like outside of your cell.</br></br>

And we started getting locked down all day every day for like two months. And then we don't get no phone calls or nothing. And then out of nowhere we started getting like a - like a 15-minute phone call.</br></br>

And - and man, it was just - it was crazy because a lot of people started getting - a lot of people started getting sick. A lot of people started getting sick, and they said.
