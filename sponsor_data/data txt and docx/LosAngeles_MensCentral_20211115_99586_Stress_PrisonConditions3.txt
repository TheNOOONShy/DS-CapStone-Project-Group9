This story was told by a person incarcerated at Los Angeles County Men's Central Jail.</br></br>

Caller: But let me get the vaccine because you are saying that I'm a carrier, and that scares me more than anything knowing that I could have something and it doesn't affect me, but I can affect someone else. That right there is kind of, like, what touched me or made me feel that – that – to need to get the vaccine because I wasn't going to get it. I wanted to wait until more tests and more – to find out the long-term effects because I do have a lot of things that I question about this vaccine, but then once you tell me that and then in order for me to go back to prison, they forcing me to be vaccinated.</br></br>

They say that I can't go back to prison unless I'm vaccinated. So it's kind of, like, okay, we're – I wanted the Moderna or the Pfizer vaccination. Okay well, they only offered me the Johnson & Johnson. Three times, they like, “Oh, we give you the Johnson & Johnson. You're either going to take the Johnson & Johnson or you don't get which one.” I'm, like, “Well, can I pick?” “No, you know, this is all we offer.” So it's, “All right.”</br></br>

So I end up having to take the Johnson & Johnson just so I can try to leave this county jail and go back to prison.
