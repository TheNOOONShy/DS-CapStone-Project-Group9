This story was told by a person incarcerated at John Latorraca Correctional Center.</br></br>

UCI: I see. And how has the COVID situation in your facility affected your family as well?</br></br>

Caller: They actually – I've had people that got sick with it. My grandma is 70-something years old right now, she's sick with it. And I'm not able to go and see her or – you know?</br></br>

UCI: Right. And so your family isn't allowed visitation. Are they at least allowed any calls or video chats?</br></br>

Caller: They give us a - they give us a phone call, once, every Monday. But it's a five-minute call. If it hangs up or it gets disconnected, it's automatically gone until the next Monday.</br></br>

UCI: Has that happened to you, where you're on the phone for not the full amount of time and it cuts off?</br></br>

Caller: Yes, it has.</br></br>

UCI: Does that seem like it's a common occurrence among other inmates as well?</br></br>

Caller: I would say yes.</br></br>

UCI: Okay. And I'm assuming that inmates have brought it up to the staff. And did they have any response to that, as far as trying to get you guys in contact with your family during this time?</br></br>

Caller: I have - I have no idea with that. I know that, from the few times I was able to get in contact, I was able to contact my brother. But, other than that, I - I don't know.</br></br> 

I mean, they really don't answer back a lot on – there's a thing called, "grievances." We could write a grievance and try to get a response. But-</br></br>

UCI: So it doesn't seem like they're even listening to the grievances is what I'm hearing.</br></br>

Caller: Yes.
