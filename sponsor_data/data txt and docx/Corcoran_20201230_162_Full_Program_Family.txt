This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Corcoran.</br></br>Well as for my experience here during this pandemic, it's been scary, lonely, and very hard. Especially with the visits. I’ve lost my wife during this because she couldn’t take the pressure. And loneliness.</br></br> 

The program has been all messed up. One day we up running. The next we slammed. It’s taking a toll on me. Especially with my case, being a lifer.</br></br> 

For example, I need help right now because there has been a change with the sentencing in Los Angeles. I’m talking about the George Gascon D.A. for Los Angeles policy sentencing. I’m currently doing enhancement time, 50 years to be exact.</br></br>

I finished my base term. All I’m doing is enhancement time. According to the new policy for Los Angeles, I should be home.</br></br> 

I’m sorry I’m writing you behind your letter but at the moment I don’t have any means for paper. Any how, I hope you guys can help me.
