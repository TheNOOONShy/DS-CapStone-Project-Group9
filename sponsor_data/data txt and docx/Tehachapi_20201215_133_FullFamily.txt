Dear PrisonPandemic Project,</br></br>

During this pandemic, it's been kind of difficult at times. From going to visiting to see my family every Saturday and Sunday, to not seeing them at all is a bit frustrating. We are on a lockdown type of program, so the friends we have that are in the other buildings, we don't get to see them either.  So now is a time where you really get to know yourself. Some people just sit in their cells and do nothing. Others either exercise or find a hobby.</br></br> 

I've found myself writing a lot more to loved ones, and exercising five times a week. We only get one 15-minute call per day, so I tried to call my loved ones and let them know that I'm good. Because when I don't, let's say for three or four days, they tend to get worried, so I try to keep everyone updated as much as possible.</br></br>

They're doing a good job with the social distancing, and mask wearing, so I feel safe. I just pray that things get back to normal soon.</br></br>

Until then though, everyone please be safe. Best wishes!</br></br>
