This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Soledad.</br></br>

The main method of communication between the inmate and his family is the phone. As soon as the virus officially entered this prison, albeit, on a separate and unconnected yard. Staff took the correct and expedient of stopping all contact visits.</br></br>

This left US mail and Global Tel (expensive collect call system) as the only two sources for an inmate to be in contact with his family. We all know the problems and delays with the US mail even before COVID. And now you quadruple that with staff shortages within the prison because of infections amongst staff, real or feigned. They get paid whether they are here or not.</br></br>

So now we get to phones. If one is in prison, his relationship is already stressed and strained, and now I'll describe a 15-minute phone call. First, as a result of cost cutting, and CTF being an old prison, the phones, 18 of them in a row, for 1,200 inmates, are located outside with no awning or protection from the weather.</br></br>

If it is 40 degrees and raining, and if you want your call, you are going to stand in line for an hour or two to make your call. Why an hour or two? Do the math 18 phones, 15 minutes each, 1,200 inmates. Even though all 1,200 inmates are never on the yard together, the revolving phone line is.</br></br>

So, 72 inmates per hour is the rate on the phone. Now if there are 600 inmates on the yard, and only half (300) want to use the phone, then you may stand in line three to four hours to make your 15 minutes collect call. In the rain in the cold, if there is no unexpected early yard recall.</br></br>

And right now, because of the restrictions placed on us due to the unpreparedness of the prison, we are only getting a shot at yard where the phones are every three to four days and only for an hour or two at a time. Now you have people cutting and bullying their way into line, wow prison is just like free society.</br></br>

And allow me to detail what an actual call sounds like with elderly parent. You dial the number using Global Tel phone monopoly, the phone tells the person on the other end, they are receiving a call from an inmate in the CDCR. Even though they already know what that because they had to create an account to get the collect call in the first place. It's just interrupting your call.</br></br>

Hello. hello. Delay. Yes what. Hello, are you there. What e you there. Yes hello, How are you doing. Good. That's good. How is mom doing and how is her health. Well I got some bad- recorder message; "You are talking to an inmate from the California Department of Corrections, Soledad, California. You and your caller are being recorded."</br></br> 

All of that was stated at the beginning of the call, but now interrupting and eating up more of your phone call. Bad what is she alright. Oh yeah she is doing fine, I was just going to say I got a bad crack in my windshield. Now you are already more than half through you treasured phone call.</br></br> 

Hey did you get a chance to order my quarterly- recorder message; "You are talking to an inmate from the California Department of Corrections, Soledad, California. You and your caller are being recorded." What were you saying now before the recording. I was asking if you had a chance to order my- recording: "You have 60 seconds left on your phone call," ten seconds later the phone automatically cuts off.</br></br>

It maybe days or weeks before you get the chance to go through that gain. Now imagine standing in the rain for two hours only to have no one answer right then. Because the only time of day that you can call, the person you are calling is at work.</br></br> 

I can see, at a glance, this can sound like whining. And very frequently you hear, "well you should of thought of that before you went to prison." </br></br>

Undoubtedly some of you are obnoxiously nodding your head yes because you agree. The problem with this thinking is this; the law is the law whether you are incarcerated or not. It is against the law to rob someone on the street and it is against the law to rob someone in prison.</br></br> 

If the objective of CDCR is to correct one's behavior, and you agree with that idea, then you can't say, "I as a tax paying citizen want these criminals locked up for breaking the law, because I am a God-fearing law-abiding citizen."</br></br>

And then say, "now that you are in jail, criminal, I support the idea of having correctional staff break the law whenever they feel like it and show no example of human decency, because you're in jail and that's what you get". Kind of smells like hypocrisy.
