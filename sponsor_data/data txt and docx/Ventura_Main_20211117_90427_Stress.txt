UCI: How have you been coping with the crisis?</br></br>

Caller: Visiting my parents, looking at the sun. Catching a glimpse of the shine. Reading the Bible, of course. It's been cool. We have a whole Bible with traditionals or like traditional speculations on it</br></br>

And working out on the ground. Accepting everything – complying. Comply, comply, comply, comply. Speak. You know, lunches – breakfast, lunch, and dinner. I’ve done the vegan. They have high protein, there’s regular – I don’t know why anybody would try and stay on regular. High proteins the way to go.</br></br>

Because you get double servings of some proteins. The breads really good in here – they have sourdough they have like pastry dough and then they have nine grain bread. So just enjoying things.</br></br>

There’s commissary but commissary's kind of a rip off, but I threw up in here. I got stomach flu. So that was kind of fun, I kind of threw up and it kind of released a lot of pressure I had on my neck. And I had the runs and that was not fun. But the shower helps – hot shower – there’s hot showers in the morning.</br></br>

You just gotta kind of get lucky. So just choosing your days. Like it helps you appreciate things once you figure it out. But in the beginning you – if you have a large spectrum, if you’re competent – because I am kind of competent. I know how court might be.</br></br>

And I would want to participate but given that I’m kind of innocent in my four charges I wouldn’t really want to. So I’m going the long route, the long safe route.
