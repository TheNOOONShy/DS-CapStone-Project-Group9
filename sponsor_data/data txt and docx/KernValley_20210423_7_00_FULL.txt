This story is told by someone incarcerated at Kern Valley State Prison.</br></br>


UCI: What has the COVID situation been like at your facility?</br></br>


Caller: I would say at first it was like- it was like everywhere, you know. It was pretty much a toss up. Nobody knew you know, what- what was the proper condition and the proper you know, maintenance of the whole issue and you know. We were given masks and we had to wear them when we come from one of our cells and you know, however, you know.</br></br>
When we go cell call or whatever, we still have to drink out of the same drinks. Well, not the same drinks, get our water from the cup. From the same water faucet and- and you know. The food situation. Everybody pretty much has had it around here.</br></br>
I had COVID I think in January? Maybe in January. Well you know it was, it was just- you know- nobody could get a handle on it. You know, finally it was the week we’ve gotten the vaccination, most of us has. It’s pretty much under control but you- you know in the beginning of it all, there really was, you know.</br></br>
I guess it was ground zero for everything you know, for everybody around here. It was- it was just a new experience and you know, finally they- they were sanitizing the showers after we took a shower. The phones, after each phone calls they were sanitizing them. But you know that’s a couple months, it took a couple months to get to that stage in this situation.</br></br>
It was- at first it was like. There was no program. There was no program, nobody could come out. Nothing. You know? They were scared for, for themselves. You know, the officers and the administration and you know, for the inmates I guess as well too. You know, they don’t want us inmates having no contact but you know now, things are a lot better.</br></br>
Things are a lot better and a lot of news. You know, inmates have pretty much a strong new system that has to do with each other. Bacteria, living in close- close quarters anyway so. Majority of us here, in this prison, I think like three people have died in this prison. Maybe, um shoot.</br></br>
I think at least like 90% of the population in here has had it. And you know- we, we have still have like the after effects like coughing at night. Like right as before I’m about to fall asleep. You know, I’m like a little, you know a little slower. Like in my workouts and stuff. But you know I got both of the vaccinations and they- they’re pretty good at that spot on, 28 days later.</br></br>
They give you the second one and for me like that vaccination was worse than the actual having COVID. You know, it wasn’t that bad it was like a mild flu, when I had it. But you know, still. We were allowed, they tested us maybe the first. At first, two to three weeks, two weeks. They tested us like every week.</br></br>
You know, they want to make sure nobody bringing it in and that was a good thing. But as anything, it slipped through and you know, it cell. Cell by cell, section by section, they were sending a lot of us in different blocks. There were quarantine blocks on every yard and, you know. They kept us separate when we tested but at first you know kind of making us tested afterwards, we were like “Nah” I’m- we’re not going to test you know because they were going to move us. I mean, we made it difficult as well.</br></br>
I’m not- I’m not going to share COVID. When I had COVID I didn’t know. It was- I couldn’t taste, I couldn’t- I had a light fever. But it was, we’re recuperating- most of us are recuperating from it. Right here, right now.</br></br>


UCI: How has the vaccination situation been like at your facility?</br></br>


Caller: It’s pretty good. As soon as they’re- they’re allowed vaccinations. I think I got my first one, oh shoot. Maybe. I don’t know, it’s been a while. They- they came around. Anybody who wanted one, got one.</br></br>
In the beginning, those who got COVID, it was on paper, they got COVID, they couldn’t take them until 90 days or maybe, 75 days later. And it- when their time was up, they came around and tested- I mean asked if they wanted the vaccination and, you know. They shot them with it and three weeks later, they shot them again. And- and you know it was.</br></br>
It was our- our facility, our yard. It’s pretty much a- it’s open enough. You know, we’re starting school, just for our building, so you know we’re having contact with our precinct staff now and. You know, most of them have been vaccinated, some haven’t.</br></br>
You know, that’s basically been our situation. If you have it, that’s on you but most of us have protected ourselves and- just so it doesn’t hit us as hard as it did last time but. Yeah, the vaccinations they’re. They’re pretty much- they’re in full swing. I mean, anyone who wants one, wants one- if you want one now, and you didn’t want one earlier, and that you refused. You can write them- and you write the sick call slip and they’ll call you in. They’ll put you in- they’ll just call you up and give you a vaccination.</br></br>


UCI: How has the COVID situation affected your loved ones?</br></br>


Caller: My loved ones?</br></br>


UCI: Yeah like, with visitations and everything</br></br>


Caller: Oh yeah well, I had to get like you know, video visits. And you know, they give us video visits here. Well, at in the beginning when they did charge video visits, it was once a month for half an hour</br></br>


Automated machine cuts in: This call and or phone call will be recorded and monitored.</br></br>


Caller: Once a month for half an hour and you know, we came out and you know we had to talk to our visitors through a- through a Skype or whatever set up they had. And you know my- my yard has, actually, fortunately have tablets here. We have tablets so we email our family from our cells and you know, they can contact us and- and get a hold of us immediately.</br></br>
But you know their situation barely opened up last month so we get one hug in the beginning, and one hug at the end. And it’s only one visitor and we can’t buy food and it’s only a bottle of water that they give us but, you know. For us you know we’re so blessed to have that because we didn’t have that for over a year.</br></br>
But you know, that’s where it’s at for now, hopefully. Every- every two weeks we get our rooms opened up more and more and hopefully they allow visitors. They expand it you know because now it’s only once a week. If- if your people get tested three days before they come in and then- they have to take that rapid test when they want to come in one a week so. You know, that’s pretty much- they have to pay 100 bucks. To take that 15 minute test. And that’s pretty taxing on our families.</br></br>
That’s not- that right there’s not cool. Not everybody has that you know. That- that pretty much visiting situations right now. If you got- if you can pay for your test- your rapid COVID test and your family can come in. And if not, that’s not happening.</br></br>


UCI: How have you been coping with everything?</br></br>


Caller: You know it’s- you know it’s not. I mean right here we got the tablets so, you know we’re not as stressed out. It hasn’t hit my family situation too bad you know, a couple people have got it and you know, they survived but. Now I have other friends and family who have- whose family hit it and you know it’s close home. And you know, all those who died and grandparents and you- you know it’s been hard.</br></br>
It’s been hard on them, seeing them go through it you know. That affects us because we love them you know, and it’s like “wow” you know. It’s not real until- for us you know, because we’re in our own little world. We’re in our own little box. You know, it’s not real until it happens either to your family or somebody close to you.</br></br>
That’s, it’s been depressing. And that respect to see it on the news. You know, a lot of people- it’s harsh I mean I imagine doing the same for everyone out there.</br></br>


UCI: What do you think would have made the situation at your facility better?</br></br>


Caller: I can say it could have made the facility better, it could be more sanitation as far as, in the beginning. Like we didn’t have a lot of, they- they said they’re passing out soap and you know they passed out soap like. Some, extra disinfectant. We don’t get disinfectant. We don’t get disinfectant unless- unless you have a, what’s it called a poor, a care taker.</br></br>
Someone who’s janitorial. The other building, an inmate and, you know- you’re not going to see disinfectant unless you- you have a relationship with them. And you know, they’ll get it for you but I can tell it could have been better sanitation and that’s pretty much the big thing.</br></br>
You know right now, we can’t even have handballs, or soccer balls because they don’t want us playing with each other. But you know, in the beginning it wasn’t anything like that and they took them and they just recently took the handballs. Which, for us we don’t really- we don’t really.</br></br>
It’s not that we don’t care it’s just- you know a lot of us already had it. We get it again, we’re not tripping but yeah. It’s just more sanitation, more social distancing. We come out for cell call and it’s, 30, 40 people and you can’t social distance. Only thing they did was have the counter with a mask on and that’s it. </br></br>


UCI: Is there anything else you want other people to know or anything you wanted to share about your experience?</br></br>


Caller: No, no not pertaining to the situation. You know, a friend of mine had just got your letter you know and you know, he shared it with me. And I was like “Look I do interviews on Youtube for you know, stories written by current prisoners and I feel like I can articulate” and you know, write books and stuff so you know. I’m like, let me share this through insights that I have and my- my facility.</br></br>
Well, not my facility but my- well yeah my C yard. Just C yard because I don’t know what’s going on in the other yards but. In this yard, I can shed a little light on what’s going on and for people out there to understand and you know, it’s getting better. It’s getting better. In the beginning, I’ll say it wasn’t. First six months, it was- it was just. Alien, it was. Cops and administration too it was-</br></br>


Automated machine cuts in: This call and or telephone number will be monitored and recorded</br></br>


Caller: There’s a lot better handle on it but then again, the worst- the worst is over for us so. You know, we’re waiting. We’re waiting to go back to program. We’re waiting to you know, get back up and running and so. You know, I mean that’s all I can conclude with that you know.</br></br>


UCI: Thank you so much for participating and calling in to PrisonPademic. Feel free to also send us any pictures or write in, your friends can write in. Your friends can call in. I mean you guys can call in and write in as much as you’d like.</br></br>


Caller: Ok yeah. Yeah I’ll do the- the people who would like to do interviews with the. I mean, I don’t care that my name is out there like, the way they run these phones now. Like for your service, so you know, everyone has their own prison ID when they make a call now. So they know who’s calling. They- they know who’s calling and who’s making these payments now, throughout California. So, it is what it is. I don’t care about repercussions. They know me, and they know it is what it is but yeah. It’s just you know.</br></br>


UCI: Yeah we will edit out any names or anything that is- before the conversation or during the conversation. Just for your safety and everything like that. But also some people- if your friends don’t want to call in, you’re also more than welcome to write in as well.</br></br>


Caller: Ok yeah, yeah I’ll probably. I’ll probably send you guys a letter just to elaborate you guys a little more on the you know. Chronologically what’s going on in this facility. I mean, you can post on your website like, I guess for me I don’t care.
I mean, they know my name. They know my books, the books I write and you know. Everything but yeah , yeah that’s what I’ll do and if you guys want to post it. If not, use it as- for your personal knowledge. Maybe have somebody else in the future you know, help the family file lawsuits or whatever. You know, whatever is going on</br></br>


UCI: Thank you so much. That would be greatly appreciated.</br></br>


Caller: Ok well, you have a good night and hoping everything works out for the best</br></br>


UCI: You as well, feel free to call or write in whenever you’d like. Thank you</br></br>


Caller: Alright. Thank you, thank you. Good night </br></br>
