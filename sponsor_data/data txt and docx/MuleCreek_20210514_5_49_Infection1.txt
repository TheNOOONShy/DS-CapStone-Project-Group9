This story was told by a person incarcerated at Mule Creek.</br></br>

UCI: Thank you so much. And um have they given vaccines where you are?</br></br>

Caller: Yes, they have already given us the vaccines. Yes, and I got the, I didn’t want to get the vaccine because I was scared. But I got one dose and I got dizzy. It knocked me down for three days too.</br></br> 

I felt a lot like the flu, a lot of headaches. A body ache, fever. And well, at the three, four days it passed. And then they put the other one on me.</br></br> 

And I thought that would not happen again but it did happen again. They put it on me just the day before. Which was, now it’s Friday, they put it on Wednesday. And right now I’m sore again and I’m going through the flu and headaches again.</br></br> 

Right now I have a big headache. Although this has happened this has stayed stuck in my head. Because I wake up and I wake up with a headache. I have to take a pill. A tylenol or whatever to calm the headache.</br></br> 

And I think that this was left, I think from the injections or from COVID. I do not know. But I did not suffer from that before and right now I am. Every day that I wake up, I wake up with a headache.</br></br> 

I don’t know, I just ask God to help me and to cure me well, and to be healthy. And well, I’m close to getting out and I hope that I come out well and healthy. And to be able to see the family that I have left on the outside. I won’t be able to see some that I love very much, which was my mother and brother.</br></br> 

They were the most important in my life and they are not going to be there but there’s nothing we can do about that. Nothing but to keep going and try to overcome all this. It has been a bad experience but at the same time it’s a lesson that God gave us to pay attention to ourselves and to pay attention to other people. And take care of  ourselves, love each other more.</br></br> 

Try to help each other in everything.
