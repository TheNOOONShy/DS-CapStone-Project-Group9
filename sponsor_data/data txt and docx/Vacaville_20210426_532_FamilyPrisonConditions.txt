This story was told by someone incarcerated at Vacaville.</br></br>

UCI: How has the COVID situation at your facility affected your loved ones?</br></br>

Caller: Oh, well I called my mom. I called my mom and my sister. I just called him yesterday and they're doing good. They don't, my mom don't want to take, my mom don't want to take this shot, you what I mean?</br></br>

UCI: Mhm.</br></br>

Caller: I mean, uh, I think my sister already took this shot, but they're doing good. Thank you for asking about them, you know.</br></br>

UCI: No problem.</br></br>

Caller: Thank you very much.</br></br>

UCI: And so what has it been like for you to have reduced visitation and like programming?</br></br>

Caller: Oh, they got it. They got for a while. They just had it. They gave us free phone calls on the, the, the, the, the people who run these phone, people. They gave us free phone calls for once a month but if your family have money they're able to put money on their phone and you call them.</br></br>

And, but now they, they opened up the visiting where your visitor got to get here an hour before, so they could take the, take the tests. And if they're negative, they can come in and visit. But they also got the, the, the Skype visiting where you can go down there and you can visit on Skype to your family for half hour.</br></br>

UCI: OK, that's good, that's good.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, it's real good. Yeah, it's real good. Yeah the, the prison here is real good.</br></br>

UCI: Okay.</br></br>

Caller: Good care of us, you know what I mean, but a lot of my friends have died.</br></br>

UCI: Ah, I'm sorry to hear that.</br></br>

Caller: Oh, that's okay, you know what I mean.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: Here today gone tomorrow. Just gotta make the best of it, you mean?</br></br>

UCI: Right.</br></br>

Caller: The best thing about the future, it only comes one day at a time.</br></br>

UCI: Definitely.</br></br>

Caller: Just gotta be ready for today. You just gotta make the best of today, you know?</br></br>

UCI: Yes. That's so true.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah.</br></br>

UCI: What else did you want the people to know about your experience?</br></br>

UCI: Well it's just, I guess it's what you make it, you know? If you choose to be a sad doggie, go be a sad dog or you could be a happy dog, you could be, you mean? Life is what you make it. And I just choose to make my life the best I can and try to put my best foot forward.</br></br>

And you know, just, in the same day, I, the same, I been here for about 30 years, the same day that I took my corona shot I went in front of the parole board, half hour later I went in front of the parole board, and the parole boarder’s on Skype. They got the Commissioner and Deputy Commissioner, and they found me suitable to go home.</br></br>

So I'm very blessed so I didn't have no side effects of the, people say you have like the soreness and this, I didn’t have no soreness or anything like that, but it all worked out good.</br></br>

UCI: That's good.</br></br>

Caller: The parole board, it all worked out.</br></br>

UCI: That's it's so great to hear. Well, that's currently all for me today and I thank you very much for participating in the PrisonPandemic. Please consider telling your friends about us and seeing if they would like to call in.</br></br>

Caller: OK, I will do that. Okay, can I call in again one day again?</br></br>

UCI: Oh, yes you can.</br></br>

Caller: Oh, good, thank you so much. Thank you so much.</br></br>

UCI: You have a good night.</br></br>

Caller: I'm happy prisoner. I'm a happy prisoner. Okay, thank you.</br></br>
