This story was told by a person incarcerated at Norco.</br></br>Caller:	So, what happened was, the reason why I wrote you guys and then I wrote a person's name is because I was in a reception center prison, right?</br></br>UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>Caller: And you know, people go home. You know, people go home and other people would go up to that person's bunk and they'll check the lockers and be like, "Oh, I wonder what so and so left behind." Do you get what I'm saying?</br></br>UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>Caller: So, someone paroled and I found, well, it was my job to clean the empty racks, you know? Like, I was a porter in the dorm that I was in. You get what I'm saying?</br></br>UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>Caller: So, I cleaned out this rack and I found this cover letter basically saying, "Hello," the person's name. Telling me a little bit about your guys' study and what was going on, you know? So, it said that not just that person, but if other people wanted to contribute or call the number or whatever, you know?</br></br>UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>Caller: So, I wrote, but I wrote it to the person that signed their name on the cover letter.</br></br>UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>Caller: So, I write poetry and stuff. You know, like, I'm not really so much looking for a pen pal like that. Like, "Oh, I need a pen pal." But I just like to post my poetry, you know?</br></br>UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>Caller: Like, I would have wanted to write a specific poem about the pandemic, about incarceration. You know, personalize, you know, it in regards to, but I didn't know if this was still going on. I didn't know if, you know, like how old that letter was.</br></br>UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>Caller: That that person had. You get what I'm saying?</br></br>UCI: Yeah.</br></br>Caller: So, that's why I called your guys' number. Because your guys' number be busy. Like, it'd be, it'll go one ring and then it'll say, "You have a prepaid call," but no one answers. You know?</br></br>UCI: Yeah. We do get calls. We are currently still active. So, yeah, sometimes the hotline can be a bit busy. But thank you for calling. You can definitely still send more poems to the address that you sent that one. If you want to do one specifically about COVID or about your experience with incarceration, that address is still accepting both types of submissions. So, you are welcome to do that.</br></br>Caller: Yeah, I sent a poem but it wasn't about COVID </br></br>UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>Caller: It was just, like a poem, just to showcase my poetry and stuff. And so, I didn't know who got it. I don't know if it got accepted. I don't know if you guys are going to post it if it wasn't about COVID.</br></br>UCI: No, I think we're posting just most, all the submissions we're getting because they're all expressions, you know? I don't think it necessarily has to be specifically about COVID. Just maybe something, you know, that you created while you were experiencing what you're experiencing, you know?</br></br>Caller: Now, I lost a relationship to COVID, you know? I lost a relationship to COVID and the poem that I wrote was, like, a poem to the person that I lost, you know?</br></br>UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>Caller: And it was pretty much like, you know, what could I put into words? What could I put into words that we didn't experience firsthand? You know.</br></br> 

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>
Caller: What could I say on letters? What could I say through mail that I didn't say to you in person? Or it was like an analysis of how, because of the incarceration, because of the pandemic, because of multiple things, multiple factors that played a key role in, you know, my relationship going from blessings to curses, from healthy to toxic.</br></br>UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>Caller: And so, it was like a breakdown of that. So, I felt like it was COVID inspired, so that's why I sent it.</br></br>UCI: Yeah. I mean, whatever you send, we're posting that on the website, as well. So, thank you so much for your contribution.</br></br>Caller: Is it still recording?</br></br>UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>Caller: Can I audio record it? Could I audio record the poem that I sent you guys?</br></br>UCI: Can you audio record? What do you mean? Do you want to send-?</br></br>Caller: Since you're recording right now, can I just say the poem verbally and-</br></br>UCI: Yeah, of course. Of course. Mm-hmm.</br></br>Caller: Okay. So, it's called, [redacted], all right?</br></br>UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>Caller: We don't accept each other for who we are. That's our biggest problem. We tolerate the differences, but the divide is constantly evolving. We should be problem solving, working together as a team. The purpose of getting close to somebody is so nothing could get in between. When you scream, I want to scream. I'm yelling in frustration.</br></br>It delights me to share my knowledge. I can't allow you to become complacent. Time isn't considered wasted as long as we're advancing as it passes. I swear, sometimes I want to let it burn, but I can't get past the ashes. I'm searching for a passage. We need a road to compatibility. I wish we had everything that's needed so I could provide you with security.</br></br>Not luxury but necessity. I wish that we were blessed with the strength that's needed to overcome the times when we get tested. My best friend, my confidante, my fortune, and my destruction. I fiend for you. You are my drug. Without you, I can't function. There's something and there's nothing. I'm having bouts of indecision.</br></br>I'll ride for you, I'll die for you, baby. It's like my heart that's in a prison. You've got your opinion and I've got my opinion, but can we strive to be objective? If you could prove your point by facts, I swear that I'll respect it. You're selective and I'm selective, but still, we chose to kick it. Your style ain't my style, but I swear I'll never dis it. I'm explicit, I'm arrogant.</br></br>I'm lawless and unruly. You're personal, you're emotional, but nothing surpasses your beauty. Is it our duty to be conflicted? Is confusion clouding our better judgment? Is forgiveness disappearing or are we just holding grudges? You're my crutches. I lean on you.</br></br>You held me when I was broken. I apologize for all the times I did not return the token. Are we broken or reparable? Is it even worth it to consider? If God's love is all we need, then we shall be delivered. Hey. You think that shit recorded cool?</br></br>UCI: Yeah, that was great. Thank you for sharing that.</br></br>Caller: You like that? Yeah. Thank you for listening.</br></br>UCI: Yeah, of course.</br></br>Caller: Yeah. But I'm going to write these people, these [redacted] people.</br></br>UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>Caller: Thank you for sending me that information.</br></br>UCI: Yeah. And if you ever want to just submit a poem, as well, like you said, you like to submit them. We are, you know, accepting them. While we do prioritize COVID stories, we accept art and expressions that you submit, as well.</br></br>Caller: I have a lot of poetry that I've been looking for a forum where I can showcase my work. I have a lot of poetry that deals with many issues. You know, like people in the fields, working in the fields, being exposed. I have a lot of poetry that maybe not just COVID related. But I'd like to also, maybe it could get posted or.</br></br>UCI: Yeah. I mean, you can send whatever you like. I'm pretty sure that they're just asking for, you know, expressions. So, I feel like that also counts, you know?</br></br>Caller: Yeah, I'll write something COVID related. I'll write something, maybe that will talk about having to wear masks, having the pandemic hit our people.</br></br>UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>Caller: You know, stuff like that. I just wanted to make sure that somebody was at the receiving end, that's all.</br></br>UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>Caller: Like I confirmed with you today.</br></br>UCI: Yeah.</br></br>Caller: Do you know any other spots where I could send poetry to? Do you know any other spots that will accept poetry, like topics of poetry?</br></br>UCI: That I'm aware of, other than the pen-pal program at UCLA, I don't think so.</br></br>Caller: No? Okay. Well, thank you for letting me share. It's been a, it's been a fruitful night. God bless you.</br></br>UCI: Thank you. Have a great night, as well.</br></br>Caller: You too. Bye.</br></br>UCI: Bye.
