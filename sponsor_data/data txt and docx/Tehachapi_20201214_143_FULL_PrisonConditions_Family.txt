Hello to whoever reads this, I’m a 36-year-old white male. I am currently housed at CCI Tehachapi State Prison. I’ve been here four years and I am serving two life sentences.</br></br>

Doing time here during a pandemic is really frustrating. You do way too much cell time and there are no programs to speak of. Right now, yard is about once a week in a small, concrete courtyard enclosure. We go with one building section with about 10 to 15 other men.</br></br> 

You’re lucky if you make it in to the canteen in the month. They have a building just for COVID-infected people. They test us about once or twice a month. They are real quick to respond to any medical slip turned in for any sickness.</br></br> 

Last week, someone two cells away from me was infected with COVID. They moved him away about two days after testing us. We have to wear our masks when we leave the building.</br></br> 

I can only use the phone once a month because I don’t have a job. I’ve been here four years and I still haven’t been given an assignment.</br></br> 

I communicate through letters, which take one to two weeks to get to me. It’s very disheartening and causes a lot of worry for my family. One of my family can get sick or God forbid, die, and I wouldn’t know till two weeks later. I’m stressed out not knowing anything.</br></br> 

Hopefully, things will change soon. I am looking forward to everyone who wants one, getting vaccinated. I am sick of worrying about our health, but I am thankful for the things I do have. For my family who loves me and for being well.</br></br> 

The correction officers and free staff, I try to stay clear of, they are the spreaders. Some of them wear masks when they are around us, most do not. This is a problem.</br></br>

Thank you for your interest. Pray for us sinners. Goodbye.
