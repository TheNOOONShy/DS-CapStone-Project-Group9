This story was told by a person incarcerated at San Bernardino West Valley Detention Center.</br></br>

UCI: Okay, and how has the COVID situation been like at your facility?</br></br>

Caller: They make us wear our masks, and we have to stay six-feet.</br></br>

UCI: Do they - do they enforce it, or do they actually like do it - like does it actually happen?</br></br>

Caller: Yes, they - they make sure that we wear our masks, even before we go to court.</br></br> 

UCI: Oh, okay.</br></br>

Caller: And if - if you don't have a mask, they'll give you a mask.</br></br>

UCI: And inside your facility, like while you're in there right now, do they make you - do they require you to wear it?</br></br>

Caller: Yes, they require me to wear a mask.</br></br>

UCI: Okay, and how has the vaccination situation been like at your facility? Like are people - are they giving vaccinations or?</br></br>

Caller: No, I don't - I don't think they're giving vaccinations out. Well I haven't received one.</br></br>

UCI: Okay, you don't think they're - they haven't offered you one or like the ability to get one either?</br></br>

Caller: No, they haven't.</br></br>

UCI: Okay, and how has the COVID situation affected your loved ones, like getting in contact with them?</br></br>

Caller: I'm not sure. I haven't received a letter from them, and I don't know when, but that's how I contact with my family members. I write them letters, but every - every letter that I wrote them, I have not received one yet.</br></br>

UCI: I see. And so are you allowed to have - like are there any programming that's happening right now or any visitation that's - that can happen?</br></br>

Caller: Yes, they - they have a little group that goes on. They don't - I don't know if they have it anymore, but they have a little group that goes on.</br></br>

UCI: Do you know what the group does, like what it's for? Or you just know that there is a group?</br></br>

Caller: I'm not - I'm not sure what the - what the group is. It's one of the clinicians-</br></br>

UCI: Okay.</br></br>

Caller: That do it.</br></br> 

UCI: Oh, okay.</br></br>

Caller: Like they - if you want to go to group, then we all come out, but if you don't want to go to group, then no one comes out.</br></br>

UCI: And so, what do you think would have made the situation better at your facility when considering COVID? Like is there anything they could have done better or that you think would have been better if they did?</br></br>

Caller: If they let me free. No, but, honestly, no, because we all wear our masks.</br></br>

UCI: That's good that they're doing - at least enforcing that. I know a lot of - I've been receiving a lot of calls where people just say that, you know, masks aren't enforced, and no one's really social distancing, and you know. So, that's good that in your facility, they are enforcing masks and just trying to keep people, you know, safe as much as they can.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah.</br></br>

UCI: And so is there anything else you want people to know about your experience during COVID?</br></br>

Caller: You have to keep your mask and your gloves on at all times.</br></br>

UCI: Alright. Well, that's - but at least that's good. At least you're, you know, staying safe, protecting yourself.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah.</br></br>

UCI: Alright, but thank you very much for participating-</br></br>

Caller: But they don't let us wear gloves in here.</br></br>

UCI: They don't let you wear gloves?</br></br>

Caller: No, they just let us wear masks.</br></br>

UCI: Oh, okay. That's good, though. Alright, but thank you so much for your participating in Prison Pandemic, and please consider telling your friends about us and seeing if they would like to call in and share their story as well. I think it's important, to just - I think it's important, you know, people calling in and sharing their stories, whatever it may be.</br></br>

Caller: Okay.</br></br>

UCI: Alright, thank you so much. Have a good night.</br></br>

Caller: You too.</br></br>

UCI: Thank you. Bye-bye.
