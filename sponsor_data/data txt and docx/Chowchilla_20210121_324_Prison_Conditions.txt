On January 12, 14, and 19, 2021, approximately 37 reception center and ad-seg inmates were moved into building 512. The 512 population was assured that these inmates had been COVID-19 tested and would just be housed in the building temporarily. On January 16, 2021 COVID-19 tests were administered to all residents of Building 512. On January 20, 2021, results were received indicating that two (2) 512 residents had tested positive, including one who was released from ad-seg on 12-14-20. Administrative and Medical staff put all residents of 512 at risk by housing inmates from multiple other areas within Building 512, an area that had been declared “stable” and was due to be off quarantine status as of 1-21-21. This failure constitutes deliberate indifference, neglect, and violates multiple constitutional protections of all inmates housed in Building 512.</br></br>
