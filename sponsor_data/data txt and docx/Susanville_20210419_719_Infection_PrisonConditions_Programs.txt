This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Susanville.</br></br>My story starts at Maryland, California. I heard about COVID-19 it was December 2019, and they cancelled visiting. I haven’t seen my family since April that year. I got transferred to another facility because that one got closed.</br></br>

I arrived a Susanville CCC March 17, 2020. About one month later things only got worse.</br></br>It went to half the population to just one building at a time it was 34 and got reduced to 24 people out on the yard for one hour. So you had to make a choice from going to get your package or calling phone or eat or library. And you only got to come out about every two or three weeks. And then had nothing for about two to three months lockdown.</br></br>Our building serviced the second wave the three waves came and all hell broke loose. One guy came up positive so they split us up put ten of us in an empty building and 10 more people a positive. The move more people from another building that they were expose to COVID. They sent them in with us. Long story short we all got it.</br></br>It was impossible to avoid no matter how much we cleaned. Our water down disinfectant didn’t kill it. I got off quarantine and moved again and got in next in with another 24 people who were all positive. I got off insulation but that time I felt like I had a bad cold. I lost my smell had body aches, runny nose, coughing and shortness of breath.</br></br> 

I went back to work as the yard crew I was the only one out there and a couple of others.</br></br>I saw the whole yard for the first time in about 12 months. January was here now it was a messed up year. No school location or self-help group or worship service. I thought everything will get better but no not yet.</br></br> 

I work serving food to all the population accept for about two buildings that didn’t offer it. Then I clean one yard and I see my friends suck and starving.
