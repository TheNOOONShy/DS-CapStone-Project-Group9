You sound like an intuitive individual, and caring, and likely a humanitarian. Wondering at how things would be in this present social tragedy for our youths, those in the free world and those in prisons.</br></br>

You’re right to think that the effects of the same cause are devastating in prisons too. I’ve attempted to convey the extreme dangers to us here at Sierra Conservation Center, but they fell on deaf ears.</br></br>

After reading the Erik Von Steich case from San Quentin’s tragedy, I began to compare the similarities of dangers in our prisons, to those expressed to the courts by Steich, in San Quentin.</br></br>

For example, one, the cells in San Quentin were said to be so small that you could touch both walls by stretching your arms. In our confinement conditions, 32 inmates could stretch their arms and touch their neighbors’ elbows!</br></br>

Two, imagine these 32 inmates trying to watch TV in a space one fifth that of the bedding areas.</br></br>

Three, ventilation in San Quentin, was said to be poor ours was non-existent, aside from opening windows. Further, there have been new ventilation systems here on the facility’s roof for more than five years, and are still there! Even when ventilation was so being scrutinized by the so-called auditors of safety.</br></br>

Four, CDCR will tell you that they care so much about inmates communicating with their families. But here, even in the extreme circumstances, the phones that have been promised to be installed since before the pandemic, are still in warehouses. So, 12 phones for 1,200 inmates is the reality of our first amendment privilege here.</br></br>

Further, the phone privileges are handled by inmates, so much of the time, extortion is practiced to get on the phone. Give me some money, and you might get a call, my homie is first though.</br></br>

Still further, our tier has 16 dorms with about 512 inmates when as packed as they’d like to be it. And when yard is released all of us go running to the single phone list on a eight by 12 piece of paper on the wall. Doesn’t that sound pretty damn dangerous?</br></br>

There is no recreational equipment in order to be safe but the area around the phone list is just fine the way it is. I could play an unheard of 20 on 20 game of basketball and it would be safer than making a phone call, or checking for my name on the phone list! Imagine the soccer field, it’s easily an area 100 times the size of a dormitory, with less people on it while playing, but safety matters then?</br></br>

I’ll share with you some of the injuries from the simple deprivation. My cholesterol level has risen 30 points and I’ve gained nearly the same amount of pounds! My only outlet for stress, anger, and exercise, has been stripped from me, on a false pretense, that CDCR cares about my well being.
