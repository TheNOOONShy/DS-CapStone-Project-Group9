Greetings to you, my friend suggested that I write to you, because he knows me and some of the things that I've been doing and figured it would be a great idea for me to share what I've been doing and how I have been conducting myself, especially doing this pandemic, which has been very trying. Before the pandemic I'd been using my time very constructively.</br></br>

I have three inventions, which is patent pending that I'd been working on, by reaching out to people, businesses and even colleges, to pay someone (an affordable price) to do animation illustration or 3D-printing prototype of my invention so that I could present it to companies to show how it would improve their product line.</br></br>

The pandemic interrupted my progress in them regards to my invention, and this facility in particular only contributed to matters being made worse, because of the incompetent behavior of this administration, which only brought about chaos and confusion, which contributed to loss of life as well as some having many long lingering help problems. It's so many missteps, deliberate neglected action of derelict responsibility to mention at this moment.</br></br>

At this moment, I am basically trying to make contact with you to: one, help in any way that I can, and two, see if your college has available assistance that I am seeking, which is any program at your college has that does animation presentation or 3D-printing prototype. Note: I will pay for it myself, I'm just seeking a price that's reasonable and affordable.</br></br>

I believe that there is a very big and substantive opportunity that I am presenting, not only beneficial but exposure that would be positively highlighted for your college or your program in particular. I just recently started a GoFundMe page and I'm requesting for you to go to it. Note: I am not asking you for any funds, but for you to just review it and gain a bit more understanding of what I'm doing.</br></br>

I am going to end this letter now, but I'll be trying to make contact with you by calling. One last note: I have a lot to offer in many substantive ways, art, music, poems, books, movies etc. Also insight into the system, I am in tune and in touch with individuals in here that have actively transformed and have solid stories and works to share.</br></br>

Take care. I wish you wellness and strength and I hope to hear back from you soon, so I haven't enclosed SASE for your response.</br></br>

PS If allowed I would like to be added to your website.</br></br>

Sincerely.
