This story was told by a person incarcerated at Chino.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah. So, you said you tested positive. What was the quality of your care like when you were, when you were positive?</br></br>

Caller: Oh, it was, it was good. The quality before was kind of weird because like I said, I don't think that some of the nurses they brought in kind of knew what it was because we were all in one building. And they were doing random testing at first, and then as they tested positive they would move them to an isolation ward.</br></br>

And for us, they would come and once somebody tested, they would quarantine the building. So, we would have to stay in for two weeks to make sure nobody you know got any symptoms. So, what they were looking mostly was for symptoms, which was a fever, you know cough, and all that.</br></br>

And at the beginning, the first wave it's just like, not that many people. Like me, myself, the only symptom I had was like a light, mild headache, and runny nose. But everybody in the building caught I guess what everybody believed would be a cold.</br></br>

And anybody that has a symptom of fever or any type of other symptoms they would move them to isolation. So, a lot of people didn't want to move. So, a lot of people would kind of like, take medicine and you know wipe themselves down before you get tested and try to not show any symptoms at least while they were being tested.</br></br> 

But yeah. Besides, after that, like I said, when we got the second wave towards the end where everybody got sick. Then they came in and tested everybody in the whole building. And that's where, like I said, like over 85 percent.</br></br> 

So, like over 80 people on each floor came out positive. And they moved them all to an isolation ward. And the isolation ward was pretty good. I mean, the nurses will come in, we would get our vitals taken twice a day.</br></br> 

They gave us a lot of fluids. They tested our oxygen level, our blood pressure, and temperature, twice a day. Other than that, we're just, I mean, we are at prison. So, it's like we're in a tiny little room and we just could come out for 15 minutes to go take a shower, you know make a quick phone call and then we can head back into the cells.</br></br> 

I mean, that's expected because where we're at. But other than that, I mean, the care was pretty good. When we had it. Once the two weeks were up they just sent us back out and they're just waiting to see what else happens.
