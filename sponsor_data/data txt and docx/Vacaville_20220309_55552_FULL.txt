This story was told by a person incarcerated at Vacaville.</br></br>

UCI: The first question I have is, what facility are you currently housed at?</br></br>

Caller: I’m calling you from California Medical Facility.</br></br>

UCI: Okay. And what has the COVID situation been like at your facility?</br></br>

Caller: [unintelligible].</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, sorry. What has the COVID situation been like at your facility?</br></br>

Caller: What’s the current situation I’m going through right now?</br></br>

UCI: Yes. What has the COVID situation been like?</br></br>

Caller: The COVID situation?</br></br>

UCI: Yes.</br></br>

Caller: It’s been kind of rough. You know, you have to try to keep yourself in good health and keep yourself clean and stay away from other people and try not to catch the COVID-19. If you do catch it, you’re supposed to report it to staff so they can get you some help.</br></br>

Right now, I have. I’m high risk on the list for COVID-19 and I’m doing everything that I can do to not catch the COVID-19.</br></br>

UCI: Definitely. Do you think they have given you the resources where you can do your best to stay COVID-free?</br></br>

Caller: Yes. I’m trying to right now. I’m trying to stay COVID-free by staying by myself and I’m in a closed living environment but it’s kind of difficult to stay away from all the people. But you have to be cautious about the things that you do and how you do it. And how you take care of yourself around here. Cause it’s easy to catch it.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, definitely. Have vaccines been accessible to you?</br></br>

Caller: Say that again please.</br></br>

UCI: Have COVID vaccines been accessible to you?</br></br>

Caller: No, they have not. I have not had it yet.</br></br>

UCI: Okay.</br></br>

Caller: I haven’t.</br></br>

UCI: Has it been offered to anybody in the facility yet?</br></br>

Caller: Yes in this facility.</br></br>

UCI: And how has the COVID situation affected your loved ones?</br></br>

Caller: I beg your pardon?</br></br>

UCI: How has COVID affected your loved ones?</br></br>

Caller: How did it affect me?</br></br>

UCI: You or your loved ones.</br></br>

Caller: Huh?</br></br>

UCI: Sorry, how has the COVID situation affected your loved ones?</br></br>

Caller: Oh, it’s just kind of bad. My brother had COVID. He had COVID-19. He had to be quarantined for about 10-14 days. He had [unintelligible]. We try to keep in contact [unintelligible] in case something bad happens we would know. We’ve talked to each other before it do happen.</br></br>

UCI: And how have you been coping with the crisis?</br></br>

Caller: It’s been kind of difficult for me because I’m not used to having my life turned upside down due to COVID-19 and that I have to carry myself in a certain way. That I have to follow the rules and regulations according to the facility to try to stay COVID-free.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, definitely. What has it been like for you to have because I know you said you’re in a separated area. What has it been like for you to have reduced visitation and programming?</br></br>

Caller: If you have COVID-19, they put you in a separate area, in another part of the institution. They warn everybody that you got it. But they separate you from the ones who do not have it.</br></br>

UCI: And what about programming and visitation? Has that been reduced?</br></br>

Caller: About medication?</br></br>

UCI: Visitation?</br></br>

Caller: Yes. They have. They normally take you to the outside hospital. Either take you and put you into another [unintelligible] where they can keep a close eye on you and find out how you’re doing and take a lot of tests. They normally test you everyday and make sure you feel alright or sick. They check your temperature, your blood pressure, and stuff like that.</br></br>

UCI: Okay. What would have made the situation better at your facility?</br></br>

Caller: What happened?</br></br>

UCI: What would have made the situation better?</br></br>

Caller: What kind of situation is it? Where I am at?</br></br>

UCI: Like is there anything that the facility could have done to make the COVID situation a little bit easier on you?</br></br>

Caller: Yes. There is a lot that could have been done such as you know, make sure that they give you cleaner for your hands. Make sure that you’re able to take a shower whenever you need to shower. Make sure to keep the air around your place clean and have the cell clean. Stuff like that.</br></br>

UCI: Okay. What else do you want people to know about your experience?</br></br>

Caller: Well, you know, listen up. They can keep inmates far apart so they can socially distance. Six feet distance right? But it is difficult to stay socially distanced from another inmate while you are in the same institution, you know what I’m saying? So you have your own cell, your own living quarter.</br></br> 

UCI: Yeah, definitely.</br></br>

Caller: I’ve been so close to other inmates all the time.</br></br> 

UCI: Yeah, definitely. That would be a huge help. That’s it for my questions. Did you have anything else you’d like to add or any questions you have?</br></br>

Caller: No, I just want to keep in contact with you and if I could help your organization. Please let me know, okay?</br></br>

UCI: Okay. Oh, I’m sorry. I do have one more question for you. Has the facility mentioned to you about a new vaccine mandate for all staff at California facilities?</br></br>

Caller: You gotta say that one more time.</br></br> 

UCI: Has the facility mentioned to you about the new vaccine mandate for staff at California facilities?</br></br>

Caller: I can’t hear what you say.</br></br> 

UCI: Sorry, that was a little bit of a long one and I know the connection is not too good. Has the facility told you anything about a new mandate for staff at California facilities?</br></br>

Caller: A mandate?</br></br> 

UCI: Yeah, a vaccine mandate.</br></br> 

Caller: A vaccine mandate? Yes, they have said something about a vaccine mandate. [unintelligible] I’d like to have my booster shot. 

UCI: Okay. That’s good. Okay, then that was my last question. Yeah, did you have any questions for me and anything else you wanted to add?</br></br>

Caller: No, I don’t have any questions. I have a comment I’d like to make to you.</br></br>

UCI: Oh yeah.</br></br>

Caller: You keep your head up and keep doing what you’re doing and stay positive and have your eyes set on the [unintelligible] so you know what God is and we will be there.</br></br> 

UCI: Thank you so much.</br></br>

Caller: And keep me in your prayers.</br></br>

UCI: Thank you. I will do.</br></br>

Caller: Have a good day.</br></br>

UCI: Thank you so much. Thank you so much for calling and if you have any updates and anything else you’d like to share, feel free to call us again or you could also write us a letter.</br></br>

Caller: Alright.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah! Thank you so much. Have a good night.</br></br>

Caller: You too. Good night to you.</br></br>

UCI: Good night. Bye bye.</br></br>

Caller: Bye bye.
