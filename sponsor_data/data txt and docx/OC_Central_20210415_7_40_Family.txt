This story was told by a person incarcerated at OCJ (Orange County Central Men's Jail).</br></br>


UCI: Yeah, understandable. And at that point like, with reduced programming and all that, it also comes with reduced visitations, right? So how, in regard to visitations with family members, how has that affected you?</br></br>

Caller: I mean it kinda sucks not being able to get visits and all that, but, I mean, I stay in contact through their phone, so for me it’s not that bad. But for some people that don’t have people who can put money on the phone like that, I guess it must affect them a little bit more.</br></br>

Even though they do get two free calls every Monday, it’s only five minutes. What do you gonna do with five minutes? Say “hi,” “bye,” “I love you,” that’s it.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah. From your perspective, I don’t know if you know, but how do you think your family is taking this situation, where they can’t visit you and they lack social contact with you, things like that?</br></br>

Caller: For me, obviously when someone comes to jail and all that, obviously the whole family suffers with him. It kinda sucks being limited to just phone calls, but, I mean, I don’t how to explain it, but I guess my family longs to see me, too. But, at the same time, we both know that there’s nothing that we can really do.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, that’s really understandable, and I’m sorry about that.</br></br>

Caller: You’re good, you’re good.</br></br>

UCI: In regard to anything that’s going on in the facility, is there anything that you would want people in the outside to know? You know, so we can be aware. For people that aren’t so connected with what’s going on in the facilities. Is there anything you would like them to know?</br></br>

Caller: Well, not really. Just kinda sucks, no hot meals. And then, I understand it’s like routine, but they do raid our cells a lot, and, sometimes, some personal information gets taken from us, but that’s about it.
