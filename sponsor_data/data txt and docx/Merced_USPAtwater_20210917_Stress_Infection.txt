Back to COVID though, it's been getting into jails and institutions mainly by the staff bringing it in, I say that to say the government should make it mandatory for all staff to have the vaccine or they will be terminated. Once it enters the building and someone contracts it they lock us down until further notice (two to four weeks at minimum) and the infected staff member gets two weeks paid leave while we're left to tough it out or suffer better said.</br></br>

I will go ahead and say that I took the vaccine the first chance that I got, in West Virginia. They sent me to Atwater USP to this RU program, thatâ€™s the only reason I'm even on the West Coast. I'm originally from the East Coast as I've stated.</br></br>

At the beginning it was stressful and I really honestly was somewhat kind of scared for my life, which is weird to say because I'm in prison my life is already at risk of being murdered by inmates and staff for that matter then I had to think about a virus that I can't even see, it was really tough. Then I got the vaccine and felt better but now all these other variants are showing up which has me wondering all over again now if things are really going to be okay in here, out there, and also all over the world.
