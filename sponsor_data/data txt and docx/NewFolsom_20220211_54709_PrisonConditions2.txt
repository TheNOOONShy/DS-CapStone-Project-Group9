This story was told by a person incarcerated at New Folsom.</br></br>

Caller: Well, this is like dealing with, I'ma say with the appeal system, basically also, I just learned that even though it's not a direct deal with COVID, but it's like just come to find out that they passed the new policy on May 2020. And then turned around, and the new type of thing came out on June that those policies that they had in there are not in there.</br></br> 

Now they just passed out another new book for July 2021. And they just gave it to us last week, so therefore, they're almost like seven months behind.</br></br>

UCI: Mmhmm.</br></br>

Caller: See these loops. What they did is, they're saying is, no longer we can file appeals at the institution. It's a grievance or complaint, and see the difference between the appeal and the grievance, the grievance is just the complaints.</br></br> 

They're not held legally abide to the grievance. That if you file an appeal the appeal, hold them up under the guidelines of the California Penal Code under the governor and state law, and they're held responsible by law.</br></br>

So if you're not filing, you canâ€™t file an appeal. Then they're not responsible for a lot of the rules and rules and regulations that they violate and break. So I got an appeal back yesterday, and it stated on their California State Prison Appeals Office. 

And see, I've been questioning this situation the whole time, because in these new books that came out, there's nothing in there with all these new fake policies they got. Because they're saying that they have 60 days to respond to you.</br></br>

And if they don't respond in those 60 days, you don't get no response, period. it just goes away. And that's what they did.</br></br> 

They've been holding people's appeals anywhere between 60 to six months over that timeline, and I filed petitions in the court where I go to, where they held them over a whole year. And then tell me that I get no response because they failed to respond to it in 60 days. And this is the this is the type of illegal tactics that they're using.
