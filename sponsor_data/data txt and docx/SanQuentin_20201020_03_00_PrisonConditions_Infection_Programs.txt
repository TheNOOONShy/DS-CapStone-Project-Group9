This story was told by a person incarcerated at San Quentin.</br></br>

Caller: So COVID at San Quentin started from nothing. And because of a bumbling judge, turned into the worst prison disaster, they're calling it that. Population I think was like 4,000 at San Quentin.</br></br>

They dropped it down to around 33 hundred with from March until like, about when I was paroling there, and within I think 10 days of my parole from there, there was almost two and a half thousand cases confirmed out of 33-34 hundred inmates- what the hell? So in a timeline, March 18, they said, okay, shut down. No more volunteers, nobody is coming in, no more programs, no more church, no more music, no more nothing. Boom, everybody is in the cells.</br></br>

Everybody is going to have meals brought, we're going to do a modified program. The whole prison is going to go on this and we're all going to rally together to beat this, and everybody's going “okay, that's great.” At the beginning of June, so we had March, April, May, right. Beginning of June is four months: zero cases, among the inmates.</br></br>

Few guards- they would on- but see they would only test if you said “I'm sick.” They didn't want to do general testing, the prison. The guards, they asked them, “Are you sick?” They say no.</br></br>

Fine, go to work. Well, if you're making $35 an hour, $30 an hour and you're making time and a half and working overtime and doing that five days a week or four days a week, are you going to turn the money down because you have a little bit of a cough or something? Probably not.</br></br>

So who knows where all those cases started coming in. There was a judge, I think it was [redacted] who I was been told that he was the guy who was appointed federal receivership over the whole states in 2006. Because the medical situation was unconstitutional it was horrible.</br></br>
