This story was told by a person incarcerated at Chuckwalla.</br></br>

UCI: And what is the current COVID-19 situation at your facility?</br></br>

Caller: Well, I already went through the symptoms and all. Really, the treatment of the medical in the facility, how, you know, they mistreat us, and actually it's like a, it's not a, how would I say, an observation unit. It's actually worse than being in the ad-seg unit.</br></br>

UCI: Okay. Okay. What is troubling or concerning to you?</br></br>

Caller: It’s really the lack of the medical treatment in the facility and the constant change of medical nursing. I’m saying that they're actually bringing in new newcomers that actually don’t even know what’s going on and how to treat us and everything during this pandemic.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm. How was the COVID-19 situation handled at your facility at the beginning of the outbreak?</br></br>

Caller: They constantly, they constantly moved us around. Once you’re tested positive, they move you from one unit to another unit, and then another unit, and it’s like you don’t feel the symptoms until they put you actually in one whole unit with the rest of the people.</br></br> 

And that’s when you start feeling all the symptoms, and you’re around a lot of people and the, how would I say, the social distancing, you’re sleeping right next to a person two feet away from you.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: So, there’s really no, there’s really no separation in, in this housing unit, and it’s just a housing unit, not a cell, not a cell. There's dorm living, not cell living.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>

Caller: So you got eight people to a cube, and like I said, you’re like two feet away from each other. You know, they - all they just want to provide you is really like Tylenol or some kind of cough suppressants or something like that, but really there’s nothing else they do for you.
