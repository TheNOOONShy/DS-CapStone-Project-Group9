This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Soledad.</br></br>

As I begin writing this on December 23rd, and confirmed by my December 24th swab test I was negative. However, without leaving my cell for any reason to avoid COVID, when they tested me on December 30th I am now infected, as is my cellmate. Our only contact with anyone was at our door, by correctional staff, inmate food servers, and the medical staff.</br></br>

As a result of the same test on the same date, 32 inmates all in my vicinity all tested positive. We're all locked down, and no one went anywhere. So they are infecting us. The medical staff conducting our vitals, go cell to cell to cell.</br></br> 

Without changing their gloves and without cleaning the oxygen sensor they stick on our fingers one inmate after the other.</br></br>

I wonder how it is spreading? It is peculiar, that these inmate infections are happening about 30 at a time and all within the general vicinity of each other. If I didn't know better, it is as though they are infecting us in batches to ultimately achieve herd immunity, just saying.</br></br>

As a result of being infected by staff, they now have uprooted me from my cell and housed me in the dorm. I am in an open-air dorm with 156 infected inmates. The bunks are not six feet apart. I am on a top bunk nearest the main door coming into the dorm.</br></br> 

My bunk is head height so every infected inmate passes less than six feet from me, exposed on the top bunk. I wonder how it is spreading.</br></br>

Tent city</br></br>

Ten minutes ago, at 8:30 at night, I was in dorm city. Now after pushing a cart with my property in it, through the mud and cold, I have arrived at tent city. Tent city is comprised of 13 eight man tents. 12 for sick inmates and one for staff. They look like FEMAS tents.</br></br>

Last night was the third night in the tent. The tents have heating and air conditioning but someone forgot to tell the company that supplied the tents and generators that preventative maintenance must be done to ensure such things, as fuses, are in working order. The temperature in the tent this morning was 41 degrees. As it was yesterday and the day before.</br></br>

So, I'm infected with COVID, brought in by staff. And now at 2:45 am when I need to use the restroom, I get out from under every stitch of covers that I have, up off my cot, sick, and walk 50 yards to the porta-potties. In the 30-40 degree range, across the dewy wet grass to do my business. Then I head back to my frozen cot, and slip back into my wet sheets from my fever breaking.</br></br>

When the little herd of medical staff come back to do vitals, we all line up sick, outside in the weather. We could go in the 13th tent that the cops use, but the cops don't want us filthy vermin in there. Plus, it's cold outside and their heater damn sure works, so they don't want to come out in the cold.</br></br>

It's cold enough that the medical staff giggle and sheepishly ask us to stick our fingers in our pockets so that they are warm enough to provide correct readings on the equipment. Here's a real hoot for you, at least to the medical staff.</br></br>

I'm a fat white, balding, 37-year-old, but my blood pressure is normal. On one of the vital checks the machine said my blood pressure was like 187/95. I said I don't think the is right. The RN just chuckled and said â€œYeah, half the time this junk equipment doesn't work right".</br></br>

That's funny, right? I'm just a stupid inmate. That according to the CDCR gets the best medical care, even better than people on the streets. Oh and I "should have thought of that before coming to prison", right?</br></br>

Well after 15 days in the tent city, I have been, thankfully, cleared to move back to a cell. Of course, not the cell I had and not with my old cellmate. So, from beginning to end, I started in my cell, got infected by staff, went to dorm city, then tent city, and now back to a cell. Not one thing is different.</br></br> 

No new precautions. No increase in disinfecting areas. No change in staff behavior towards protocols. What was the point in all that movement?
