This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Vacaville.</br></br>

Hey these days have been so unbearable, I've been in and out of quarantine all last year. We were not allowed groups and I was in department of mental health. I was denied board last year and my mom was sick. I only have five years left, and I wrote the governor to beg him to let me out to a halfway house or a sober living program.</br></br>

I'm doing enhancement time, my controlling case was only resisting arrest and zero criminal threats, and I was sentenced to 20 years. I got hit with ridiculous enhancement time, which should have been illegal. Help me get in touch with our governor. Tell him I don't even know my kids, never met my daughter at all.</br></br>

I'm in here over a woman scorned because I had another girl pregnant. Now I might lose my life because I started messing up out of anger. My trial was set to fail me and possibly get me killed in the county riots and prison riots.</br></br>

They won't let us out. Just throw us in a cell and forget we are human, they expose our food to air, we don't get laundry. This place has no outlets for TVs. I'm trying to go to a mental hospital till I go home. I've burned my skin with flames on 10 different occasions. I've had skin grafts. I've sliced open my wrist and veins. I've hung myself a couple of times. Hear voices.</br></br>

John 16:24. I'm 40 years old. I'm bipolar and I hear voices and sometimes see things. I was in my fathers' hands on Christmas when I was three, and he blew his brains all over me while dying in my arms. It's all on record. This happened in Fontana, California.</br></br>

Just a man who wants to make it home to his kids and start a new life. I gave my life to Jesus Christ and the Father has a plan for me. I'm going to baptize and shower the homeless and poor. I'm gonna start a chain of food trucks and do CDF firefighting.</br></br>

I went to fire camp, and on the first number I was discharged successfully, and didn't get to tell the jury in which that would have raised reasonable doubt and got me acquitted. My lawyer failed to call my old PO as a material witness because people were calling him lying on me.</br></br>

Dear self, hey.</br></br>

Hello, how are you doing out there, safe I hope. Say, thank you for the letter, I was shocked because I don't have any friends who write or visit. You sound like a young angel, God bless your soul and your family and support group.</br></br>

My grandmother passed Easter Sunday and I was on suicide watch, due to self-harm. Say, self, you should always do the right things in life because jail is no place to be. I've been praying for God to let me get my story exposure because I'm a father of 4 16 year olds that I love and miss crucially dearly.</br></br>

Two sets of twins, two girls by a lady, and two boys by another lady. My mom has my sons who are bad, I think because I've been locked up their whole life. 15 years. I was on the phone with my son in the pandemic because he had motorcycle accident and had to get a cast. I was so worried, me and some officers got into it, behind his insensitivity, he said I don't care about your son leg, get off the phone.</br></br>

Now I have a court case because three officers jumped on me. This was past December, and now grandmother passed. It's just been so unbearable, self, I've been contemplating dying by pills. I'm still going through so much.</br></br>

I just want to go to a yard where no one else politicking, mainly as far as prisoners and staff also. Because I've been getting into so much behind my mental illness and checkered behavioral past. I keep begging the warden to let me parole. I've changed, the board denied me last year, and I have a job waiting, car, and living. My mom is disabled now, she needs me home. Come hear more story.
