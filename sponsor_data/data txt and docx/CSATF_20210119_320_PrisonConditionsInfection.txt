This letter was written by a person incarcerated at SATF (California Substance Abuse Treatment Facility and State Prison).</br></br>COVID-19: I caught COVID-19 twice, once in 2019 and then in 2020. Both times I almost died because I was thrown in a cell without care “a cold cell” (40 degrees). I believe CDCR is using COVID-19 to kill off prisoners who are old, disabled, sick because it cost them too much to maintain them financially. I recently costed them about $200,000 in 2018-2020 (medical).</br></br>I’m 66 years old, with diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure, cirrhosis of liver (L-4), mobility/hearing impaired, incontinence. On 12/6/20 I was told I had COVID-19 and I was placed into solitary confinement without any activity, no day room/ no yard/ no showers/ no diapers/ no clothes exchange, while I have “pneumonia”. This lasted 30 days till 1/6/21.</br></br>It was severely cold in cell with “no” heat at all. The cold cement walls were like a coffin. My legs, hands were frozen, so I could not move them very well. They said the heating was messed up, but on the day I got out of solitary confinement the heat magically came back on.</br></br>I caught COVID-19 because nobody properly cleans anything. Nobody wears masks, the showers are filthy while over 50 prisoners a day use them. It’s impossible to practice safe distancing because many prisoners don’t wear masks, and touch meals often serving, and many are very low functioning “mentally”, and should not even be in prison, they should be in a mental facility.</br></br>I still have pneumonia but it’s getting better no thanks to CDCR. I believe that in order for a crime to be designated as serious/violent crime, there must be medical records and financial statement to support the conviction.
