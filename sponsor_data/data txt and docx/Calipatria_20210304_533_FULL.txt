This letter was written by a person incarcerated in Calipatria.</br></br>2-25-21</br></br>Hello PrisonPandemic,</br></br>My name is [redacted], and please excuse my late response, but you have to forgive me because lately IÕve been all in my COVID feelings. IÕm very much appreciative of your care and your support for me and my fellow inmates because your letter is proof that Incarcerated Lives Matter.</br></br>This pandemic has been crazy, huh? But only if the real world knew how crazy COVID-19 can be behind bars. I promise you that my letter may be late, but my hurt, pain, and cry for help comes ready-made. So, if you can truly help me or us then, please! Write back, so I can know that my words are heard, because if a crime goes unpunished the entire world will be unbalanced.
