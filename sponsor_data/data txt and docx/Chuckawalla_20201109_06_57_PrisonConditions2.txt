This story was told by a person incarcerated at Chuckawalla.</br></br>

Caller: Well, from the beginning we were getting a test every single day. Excuse me, we were getting a temperature check and we were also, that was three times a day or three times a day.</br></br>Two times a day, excuse me, we were getting a temperature check. And then about a month, maybe two months later, we ended up receiving the swab, nasal swab test. And the majority of us came back positive. And then as time grew, all of us were positive. So, it was fine.</br></br>And then it came back with 12 inmates that were negative. So, they had them sign a waiver saying that they'd like to stay here a month with the rest of the inmates that were positive or be transferred to another yard. Which at that time, their yards were infected also. So, it didn't make a difference what yard an inmate got transferred to.</br></br>They weren't giving us any type of, you know, chemicals whatsoever because they said we don't have none, we don't have none. But yet, you know, the porters, they have to do what they do, which we understand. But at the same time, we needed for, you know, to keep anything and everything wiped down. They supplied us with five masks which are fairly decent.</br></br>But as time went on, of course they get used. And to hold them on our face, you know, the bands get stretched out. So, we improvise. And of course, that ain't working, you know, so you have to discard it and turn it in. And of course, you get somebody else's used one. So, that's kind of it in a nutshell.</br></br>UCI: Okay, for our last minute, is there anything else that you would like to share about your experience?</br></br>Caller: Like I said, you know, they're putting us - we're all clean and healthy in this area. And then they bring inmates. That's the most important part, you know, we don't seem to understand why they would bring an infected inmate in with us that are not infected.
