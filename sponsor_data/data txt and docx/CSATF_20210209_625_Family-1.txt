Caller: I mean, man, it’s harder to stay in touch with loved ones. Visit them, see them. I have a little son, you know, it’s hard to explain to him that, like he understands, COVID and all that, but it’s hard to explain to him why he can't see me or come visit, you know? So, it’s kind of a burden on them also. It just makes it more difficult to be in touch, just the letters, you know?
