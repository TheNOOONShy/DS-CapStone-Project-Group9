This story was told by a person incarcerated at Elmwood Correctional Facility.</br></br>

Caller: Okay. And when - when someone gets booked, they are sent to a building where there's only single-man cells. And you're - you're placed in there for at least a night.</br></br>

And then after one night, if you have tested negative for COVID, you are moved over to the medical unit. They call it, which is, I think it stands for medical building. I'm not real positive what it stands for. But anyway. We're placed over here.</br></br>

And we're supposed to be – it's basically a cell that can hold eight women. There's four bunk beds total in the room with a sink and a toilet, basically. And we are supposed to be in there for 14 days for quarantine.</br></br> 

I guess just to make sure that you're symptom-free before you can be moved from this unit on. Unfortunately, it's not well monitored. What has happened is we've been in this room for – I'm going on for eight weeks and you're only supposed to be here two weeks.</br></br>

And the problem is they keep funneling in more and more people into the room. New people kind of go in and out like a revolving door. And therefore, you're getting exposed and re-exposed. So, that's been the problem, why we've been here for so long.</br></br>

And - and then after – what's supposed to happen is after that two-week, that 14-day quarantine, you're then supposed to be reclassified to go onto more of a dormitory - style of living quarters. And so, that's what we're obviously hoping to do and get out of here. What's so bad about the place that we're in right now is we're locked in the room for 23 hours a day, with no access to the outside.</br></br> 

I haven't seen the sky and the only hour that we're able to come out is to be able to shower. And then we go into a room where there's a TV and there's some telephones that we have access to. Besides that, we're locked in that room for 23 hours a day.</br></br>

And we can't exercise. We can't breathe in air. And it's - it's very hard.</br></br>

The food's pretty bad. We've had maggots in our food. From what I understand, and I'm not positive, is that the men used to cook. And provided pretty decent meals.</br></br>

But since COVID has hit, they're using an outside vendor to, you know, ship the food. And it's being shipped from Washington. I forgot the name of the vendor that's shipping it. But it's somewhere from Washington.</br></br>

And the food is expired by many months every time we eat it. And the beginning part of November, we actually able - were able to see maggots in our food. Many of the girls here have then since gone on a hunger strike because of the spoiled food.</br></br>

And then they just kind of depend on the food that they can buy with their own money through commissary. What else? The guards are okay here. They've not been mean really to us like that – or anything like that.</br></br> 

They've - they've been pretty decent. But the problem is understaffing. And when there's understaffing, we go into a lockdown.</br></br>

And what I mean by a lockdown is we are literally locked down. We cannot leave the room at all. So, instead of the 23 hours in the room, we're there 24 hours.</br></br>

And then we don't even have access to a shower. And we're probably in a lockdown on average between three to four days a week. We're - we are confined to our room for 24 hours a day. And that goes on.</br></br> 

We just – we were in a lockdown last night. Right now, obviously since I'm on a phone, we are not on a lockdown. And going back to the programming time, that one hour that we're allowed to go out.</br></br>

We never know what time it's gonna be. So, it's not like we can tell, you know, our family. Okay, we'll call you at 6 o'clock or we'll call you at 7 o'clock or anything like that.</br></br> 

Because we literally have no idea. And right now, it's, you know, 9 o'clock. So, sometimes, you know, families are not available at that time.</br></br>

And certainly, our attorneys are not available at 9 o'clock p.m. So, it's very difficult to have contact with the outside world. So, we're really kind of at their mercy as to when we can come out of the room and use a phone.</br></br>

And as far as like writing people, you know, we can write letters and stuff like that. But we are not given any - any pens to write with. We're given pencils, but no access to a pencil sharpener.</br></br>

So, once that pencil goes dull, we have no way of writing at all. And as far as paper goes, you have to buy paper if you want to write anything. And you have to buy an envelope, and buy a stamp, and all that kinds of stuff.</br></br>

So, it's not as though we have good access to any of that. So, anyway, I think that's probably it that I can remember right now off the top of my head.</br></br>

UCI: Thank you so much for sharing all of that. I'm so sorry to hear you're going through this. Oh my gosh.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah.</br></br>

UCI: I have a couple of follow-up questions. How many women would you say are – are - well because you said you're in the - it's all ladies that are in your section right now, right?</br></br>

Caller: I'm sorry? Can you say that one more time?</br></br>

UCI: Oh yeah. Well, how many people would you say are currently in quarantine with you guys?</br></br>

Caller: So, there's – let's see. Hold on I'm going to put the phone down for a quick second and count how many rooms there are. Hold on.</br></br>

UCI: Oh, okay. Thank you.</br></br>

Caller: Okay. So, there's eight rooms of eight women each. And then it's strange because it seems like we're on some sort of a medical floor. And, you know, since I'm only confined to my room, I can't like take a tour of the whole floor.</br></br>

So, I don't - I'm not certain. But I know that there's men on this floor too. And I know that there are a lot of cases of COVID right now.</br></br> 

And we're literally next door or down the hall from those people. And that's scary in itself. The other thing I forgot to tell you is we don't even have hot water running in our sink.</br></br>

So, you would think with COVID, you would want to be extra clean and be able to wash your hands properly with warm water. And we don't even have that. We have cold water.</br></br>

And that's it. And then the showers are very dirty. Very, very dirty.</br></br>

They're supposed to be cleaning those I think after each use. We're lucky if the showers are cleaned, you know, every few days maybe. And a ton of people are going in and out of those showers regularly.</br></br>

So, it's scary as far as the COVID goes. And, you know, you can't force the inmates here to get vaccinated. It is their choice. I've been vaccinated, but many have not been.</br></br>

But they are tested. But that test is only as accurate as the day you test, right? So, you just don't know what you're being exposed to here. And we don't have hand sanitizer because they're afraid that people will drink it and get drunk off it or something. And so, we have very little to keep ourselves, you know, free of this.</br></br>

We are given masks. But as soon as you go into your room with seven other women, you're not wearing your mask inside the room. You're wearing - you're wearing your mask just to travel from your room to the shower.</br></br>

Or from the room to the telephone. I'm sorry, I've got to cut the call short. The guard is here, and we need to go back to the room.</br></br>

UCI: Okay. Thank you so much for calling. We appreciate your time. I know you said you only get to come out for an hour a day if that. So, thank you so much for using some of that to call us and share your story.</br></br>

Caller: Oh, I'll try back tomorrow.</br></br>

UCI: Okay, sounds good. We'll - we'll be here tomorrow. Thank you so much.</br></br>

Caller: Thank you.</br></br>

UCI: Have a good night.</br></br>

Caller: Bye.</br></br>

UCI: Bye-bye.
