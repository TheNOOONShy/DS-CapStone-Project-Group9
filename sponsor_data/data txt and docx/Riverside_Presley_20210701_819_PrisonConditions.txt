This story was told by a person incarcerated at Robert Presley Detention Center.</br></br> 


UCI: So, what facility are you currently housed at?</br></br> 


Caller:        I'm at Robert Presley in Riverside.</br></br>


UCI:        Riverside. And how has COVID been like for you at your facility?</br></br>


Caller:        As far as me, it hasn't affected me at all except for the way they run things right here. I guess it was different. Instead of everybody coming out at once, it's mostly down to quarter tiers. I'm in a pod day room where there's 20 cells. So, they're only releasing five of them every hour.</br></br>


        So, a majority of the time, we'll get twice a day to come out for about 45 to an hour, and that's because of the COVID I hear. Before, it was everybody out at once, you know, and lock it down every hour and then come back in. So, that's how COVID has affected that as far as day room anyways. But do you have a question and, like, something specific?</br></br>
