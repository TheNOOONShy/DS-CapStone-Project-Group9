Dear PrisonPandemic,</br></br>

First and foremost I would like to give a special thanks to the UCI organization for taking the time to reach out to me. I’m also delighted to hear from your guys’ organization and get to know a 'lil bit of this program.</br></br>

As far as I’m doing, I’m getting by just fine, just taking it day by day. Thank you for your concern on my health but unfortunately I, myself caught the COVID-19, besides this I’m good. I also want to have hope by the time you receive my letter, it finds every single UCI organization family doing much healthy.</br></br> 

This experience for me in this pandemic has opened my eyes on life. Such as, my family cause you never know what can happen and other thing is the small things like spending time with them can be special or even a hug.</br></br>

Well the pandemic life in prison for me has been not so well for me due to poor rules in here. As I was staying, I was one of the inmates to caught the COVID. There is nothing we can do but hope everything goes good. My experience in here with no visitation has been real difficult without seeing my loved ones.</br></br>

But one good thing in this pandemic is allowing us to get two free phone calls to any one of your liking.</br></br>

I want to ask if the UCI can help me with anything, such as educational programs to better myself or programs of any kind? Thank you for your lovely time and asking me to write to you guys and hope to also hear a 'lil bit. Please be safe and take real good care of yourself.</br></br>

Respectfully.
