This letter was written by a person incarcerated at San Quentin.</br></br>

Some, more evident than others, overpopulation. Scarce medical attention available and the inner workings of the corruption and criminal behavior of the CDCR system. I among the incarcerated have been sentenced and convicted, which is our punishment to society.</br></br>

However, we were not sentenced to death. Many of us, have embarked on a path of rehabilitation, change, and insight inwardly, as well as out. Yet there is an unspoken rule of punishment reflected in the nonchalant way we are handled and cared for.</br></br> 

This disdain, or indifference, was clearly shown to the population here at San Quentin State Prison, that resulted in the death of 28 inmates. During this unfortunate time, we have not been issued proper supplies, hand sanitizer, disinfectant, proper PPE, and of course space.</br></br>

We have been shuffled around to display an illusion of a reducing population. There has been fabricated reports expressing things are better, and our needs are being met. And that guidelines are being met, these factions are reflected in the court order the reduce San Quentin population by 50 percent which exposed those reports as I said fabricated.</br></br> 

CDCR is attempting to transfer inmates to further avoid these issues. Sadly, we were into the second wave of this pandemic and little to no action has been taken to avoid another terrible spike. Only forced transfers to other institutions also now active in high number of COVID-19 cases.</br></br>

This again is that evident careless behavior, and notion that incarcerated lives are less in importance, and obviously needs little to no planning and attention to our wellbeing. We are however in high hopes of the coming vaccine now available to the public.</br></br> 

Thank you for your concern, and for taking the time to reach out to us.
