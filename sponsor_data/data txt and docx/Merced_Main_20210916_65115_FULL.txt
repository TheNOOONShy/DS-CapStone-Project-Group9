This story was told by a person incarcerated at Merced County Jail.</br></br> 

UCI: Oh. Okay, great. Thank you. So, tell me about your experience.</br></br>

Caller: So, I've currently been incarcerated since before the pandemic. And since the pandemic hit, there's been a lot of things that have affected us. As far as, first of all, like, visits with our families that would occur on the weekends.</br></br> 

And also from visits, family visits, which would be where our families got to come in and spend time with us overnight. And since the pandemic has started, we don't have those anymore.</br></br>

No in-person visits, nor do we have family visits where I could spend time with my children. Also, due to the pandemic, like we no longer have school or church or NA, AA, any of the classes that we were given prior to that. In prison, we only get out every other day for a shower and to use the phone.</br></br> 

And we are fed meals in our cell. We are lacking exercise. The mail is taking longer. And it's just, for me, the whole thing through the pandemic is missing my family and not having a way to be in touch with them.</br></br>

UCI: And I know you're pretty much on lockdown still. Is that right?</br></br>

Caller: Yes, ma'am. Like, I came out to the county jail because I had another charge of a DUI, and, like, we have more  - we have more freedom in this county jail than we do in the prison. In prison, we wear our mask everywhere we go. In our cell, out of our cell, which I know is good. But, like, in here, like they don't do any of that.</br></br>

UCI: Is there a push right now in, you know, either facility to get vaccinated?</br></br>

Caller: In prison, they are. They, like, come in like twice a week and are telling people about the vaccinations. And like there's a signup sheet in my unit right now, which, let me see, 120 women are in each of my - in my unit. And there's six units where I'm at. And I think last knowing, there was only 20 women that were not vaccinated in my - in my housing unit.</br></br>

UCI: Wow. And because of this push, then, are they doing anything to help with being able to see your loved ones?</br></br>

Caller: No. No, not at all. And I feel like, I know like the world has opened up, so I feel like we should be able to have visits, you know? But as of yet, like, we weren't able to have family visits where our families come and stay with us, you know? I have young children and I would like to like remain in contact with them.</br></br> 

And, so, where I'm at is, it's a long ride. So, for my family to come visit for, like, the day, is like, it's not cost efficient. So, the only way I can see them is through the family visits, which is two - three days and two nights that we get to spend together.</br></br>

UCI: So, what did the facility do as far as being able to have visitation right when the pandemic hit? And then, has it changed at all? Have they done anything differently? Kind of describe that to me.</br></br>

Caller: So, when we, when the pandemic hit, they just - one day, we had visits, the next day, we didn't. What they have done to - they've, like, put in video visits, but it doesn't matter if your family was approved for in-person visits. They have to get re-approved for the video visit.</br></br>

Which my children, my adult children, like, three months ago put in and I still haven't heard anything about it. So, for them to get cleared, there's a backlog because of all, everything that's happening. And where I'm at, we're continuously, the minute we think we're going to get off lockdown, then a staff member comes and they have COVID. So, then we go back on lockdown for two weeks to make sure that nobody has it.</br></br>

UCI: So, it seems like they don't communicate at all.</br></br>

Caller: At all. And when we try and ask questions, it's as -  what is it that they tell us? It's an "as you need to know" basis. As need to know basis, and we don't need to know. We'll know when the - when it concerns us. But like everything concerns us.</br></br> 

Like we're being fed in our cells, the food is cold. We're not being able to see our loved ones. We're not getting any exercise. We're not being able to go to our religious services, or like me, I'm an alcoholic. I'm here for DUIs and I can't even go to my classes.</br></br>

UCI: Which, in turn, the classes do help, sometimes, with getting released.</br></br>

Caller: Right. Definitely. Like, when I was sentenced, I have to do 52 weeks of certain classes. And I can't get the classes met because they haven't lifted the restrictions, so the classes aren't being offered.</br></br>

UCI: And it hasn't, I'm just trying to emphasize, it hasn't changed at all since the beginning of the pandemic?</br></br>

Caller: No, ma'am. We are always getting, like, memos that are going to, "On such and such date, we're going to need to start such and such." But in the meantime, somebody else has came down with COVID. So, then we have to start all over again.</br></br> 

Like, we have to be COVID free for so long before they do certain things. And we can never make it to that COVID free part because officers or free staff, you know, they go out there, get sick, and then bring it back in. Or not sick but a carrier, or however it works.</br></br>

UCI: Do you see a lot of correctional staff taking all of the precautions seriously?</br></br>

Caller: So, our feeding, the way that we're supposed to be fed is, like, total PPE, you know, gowns, gloves, eye protection, mask, whatever. And I think maybe one out of 10 do it that way.</br></br> 

Like, our last scare or the last was a physical therapist, which is, you know, the doctor, and then two staff officers came down with COVID. Because I guess they have to test prior to coming in, and it's a rapid test or whatever. And so, then we're back on lockdown again.</br></br>

UCI: I'm so sorry. Has your family been able to get any information about visitation from the facility?</br></br>

Caller: So, whenever, like, my daughter is in the military. So, whenever she calls, they can't be given any information because it's not pertinent to them.</br></br>

UCI: Wow. So, if she were to go and try and set up a video visitation like you described -</br></br>

Caller: She can't because she hasn't got the approval yet, even though she was approved to come for my family visit. She's not approved for video visits and I don't know what the difference is. Like, a video visit is through a monitor. She's not even coming on grounds, where she's approved to come on grounds but it's not good enough to have a video visit.</br></br>

UCI: Do you know anyone that's had family members approved for a video visit?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, I have, but it's taken them like four to six months to get approved. Because in prison, everything runs slower. Like, a week in prison is like a month on the outside.</br></br>

UCI: So, what about letters, then? How is that working out?</br></br>

Caller: So, the last letter I got was yesterday and it was postmarked August 2nd.</br></br>

UCI: So, over a month it took to get to you.</br></br>

Caller: Yes, ma'am.</br></br>

UCI: And -</br></br>

Caller: And again, they say this is the reason why, is because short of staff due to COVID. Everything that happens is short of staff due to COVID. Either they're taking care of their family members that have, or they have it, or whatever.</br></br>

UCI: But it's always, there's always something that -</br></br>

Caller: Always something.</br></br>

UCI: Have they given any indication when programming is going to resume in your facility?</br></br>

Caller: Well, like I said, like we have a tentative date and then somebody comes down with COVID again. And so, we have to go back on lockdown. So, like, just right when we're going to come out. Or a couple times, we have come out, and then, like, two weeks later, we're down for three months, six weeks.</br></br>

UCI: I'm so sorry.</br></br>

Caller: A lot of us, you know, I know that it's rough, but like, sometimes, I think it's the way that they - it's just easier for them to just keep us locked in our cells.</br></br>

UCI: I can see that and I know how badly you want to see your children. And, you know, I can't imagine.</br></br>

Caller: I registered for school and now I'm going to get a W because, like, I couldn't even turn in my assignments. Because we can't go to school. Like, I go to school for like milestones. But I can't even get the milestones because I can't go to school.</br></br>

I can't get my AA classes done or my NA classes done because I can't go out. It's one thing or another.</br></br>

UCI: For schooling, they're not even allowing materials to be brought to your cell so you can do it in your cell?</br></br>

Caller: They're allowed packets, like for general education. But like our college classes have to be proctored. So -</br></br> 

UCI: Wow. So, they didn't do anything differently for the college courses during the pandemic to accommodate for what's happening?</br></br>

Caller: Sorry, the phone is going to hang up. I have one minute left.</br></br>

UCI: That's okay. We really appreciate you calling. We really do. And if anything changes or you have more to share, please call us. We really appreciate stories like this, especially when it comes to programming and how all that is working because it's so different. But I really appreciate you taking the time to talk to me tonight.</br></br>

Caller: Thank you. You have a blessed day.</br></br>

UCI: You, too. Bye.
