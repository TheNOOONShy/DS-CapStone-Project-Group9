This story was told by a person incarcerated at Mule Creek. </br></br>


Caller: Mule Creek here, they did a pretty damn good job of containing it and I cannot say what happened to where it got to the point where it is now here at this specific institution. But in the beginning, we were doing good. It was so good and you would see, even on the news you would see you know and read about the other institutions in the state and you would just be like “Wow that’s horrible. At least we’re doing good here. We don’t have it. It’s not like that here.”</br></br>


 And then all of the sudden it hit like a, I mean it just exploded and it is just, it’s it’s ridiculous. And to see how it has spread. And I think for me, personally, the, the reaction to it is just disturbing like I, I’m speechless to see how they just, don’t care, I guess? I mean they do care but they don’t care? It’s just, and it might sound harsh to say but that’s what it seems like.
