This story was told by a person incarcerated at Riverside County Smith Correctional Facility. 

UCI: Wow. How have you been coping with the crisis in your facility?</br></br>

Caller: Well, you know, I don't hang around people. Just stay away from people, don't have a huge conversation with them. And if they're not wearing their mask then, you know, I'm wearing mine. And the only time they wear their mask they come in the night, like tonight, and head count. Everybody wore their mask. They coming in before that everybody had two masks. Well, we all got two masks. And then, after that there's been the third time tonight and, you know, nobody's wearing their mask because it's late. Well, I ain't right now, I'm on the phone, but other than that, that's just how things go.</br></br>
