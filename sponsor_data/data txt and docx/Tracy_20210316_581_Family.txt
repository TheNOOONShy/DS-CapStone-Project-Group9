This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Tracy.</br></br>

I try to keep in mind that this pandemic is new and sudden to us all. I have never felt this hopeless and powerless in my life. I pray to God to give me the strength to endure through the stress that the pandemic so abruptly caused in my day to day living.</br></br> 

I haven't been able to see or touch my daughter in eight years, when I came to DVI in 2019 from San Quentin Reception around Halloween. Due to communication issues with my daughter's mom and the fact that SEE can't get approved, I never had the opportunity to touch, hug or kiss my baby in eight years. Every day that goes by without her in my life, kills my soul softly.</br></br> 

I'm dying in inside. My heart breaks at just the thought. And now the prison system try and kill me by use this pandemic as a cover. Now that I survived COVID, I'm labeled as "resolved." Pray for me and my family, and thank you for caring.
