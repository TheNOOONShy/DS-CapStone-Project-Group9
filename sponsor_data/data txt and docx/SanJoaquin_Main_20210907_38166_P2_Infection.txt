Caller: COVID, itself, it's a mild cold, at best. It's a slight flu. It's nothing. But when you go to sleep at night, something kicks in. Like they sort of hybrid something to it, like this little weapon or something.</br></br>

It's, like, weaponized at nighttime when you go to sleep. And it really kicks in hard, and it attacks any preexisting ailments. Anything that was wrong with you, it kicks it into hyper drive.</br></br>

For instance, I have a tooth that, over a year ago, the filling fell out, and it left like a crater of a tooth. And I was later eating an ice cream from the ice cream man with my kids. And when the frozen [unintelligible], it just shattered my tooth to where there's nothing left but a little stub sticking up where the tooth was. I still need to go get that fixed.</br></br>

And from that, I sometimes have a slight infection in my gum maybe from a piece of food that got stuck in there. And so, my gum at the time when I got the COVID was slightly swollen. I had some type of an infection there.</br></br>

And then, my tongue is just really raw because I'm picking at the damn thing all day. So, normally not a big deal, nothing special. But when I'd go to sleep at night, I'd wake up either in the middle of the night or the next morning or both, and it was like my tongue was so swollen, I could barely talk. And my gums were just on fire.</br></br>

They were just like radioactive. And this would happen only at night when I was sleeping with COVID, just every time. As soon as I'd go to sleep, within 40 or 50 minutes, something had kicked in, and any wound I had would just be inflamed and going out-of-control crazy.</br></br>

So, my theory is that these people, and mostly the elderly, they come into the hospital with these preexisting conditions, like my uncle. Recently, he went in with complications with his diabetes, and then he caught pneumonia in there from it and then, soon after, COVID.</br></br>

And it took him out. He died. And I'm thinking this is because standard... I've been in the hospital many times, have been ill with some serious ailments. And I know hospital protocol is like, when you come in with these conditions, they just lay you down in bed.</br></br>

They want you just to rest it out and just sleep through it all and just get through it that way. And sometimes they even induce coma to get you through it. And I'm thinking it's when they do this process of this that people are killed in their sleep. That's when you die.</br></br>

Because if you have something crazy wrong with you and then COVID attached to it, it's going to get you. It's going to inflame that. It's going to turn into hyper drive, and it's going to get you in your sleep.</br></br>

So, the best way to keep these people alive is, it doesn't matter what the preexisting condition was when they came in and how bad it was, you get these people up. You maintain them. You get them out of bed. You walk them around the room all day.</br></br>

You keep them... You make sure they eat. You just keep them up with their standard daily regimen of what they should be doing without these ailments. Make them endure the pneumonia. Make them endure whatever else is there. Make them suffer through it.</br></br>

Wake them up. Get them out of bed. Keep them out of bed [unintelligible].</br></br>

The COVID goes dormant if you do. It just dies off and just kind of goes dormant when you do this. I went for a day during the COVID where I was like, "Oh, man. It's really getting to me," it will also suppress your appetite and keep you from eating a little bit.</br></br>

And it was like 2/3 of the way through the day, and I started to actually feel sick. I'm like, "Oh, man. This COVID maybe is going to make me feel a little sick." And then I realized, "Oh, shit. I haven't eaten today."</br></br>

And I just went and made a meal and ate it. And ten minutes later, I was back to normal, doing pushups and running around the room. So, yeah, because I mean I get real sick if I don't eat. I need like 5,000 calories a day.</br></br>

So, yeah, just normally I just get sick without eating. So, COVID suppressed my appetite. I was sitting there convincing myself I'm sick, and then I realized, "I haven't eaten." Did that. Back to normal.</br></br>

So, yeah, I think this COVID is seriously something that will only kill you in your sleep. If you stay active... If there's any way you can get that information out there, any sort of nurses or hospitals or doctors or the medical community, it might just save a life.</br></br>

I don't know. I know, from my experience, I wouldn't let anybody go to sleep on this stuff if they have bad ailments or a preexisting... It's not going to go well for them. So, yeah, there's that.
