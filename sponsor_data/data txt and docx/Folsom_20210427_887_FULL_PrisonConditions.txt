This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Folsom. </br></br>Dear PrisonPandemic, </br></br>Greetings and best wishes to y’all! Thank you for your missive I don’t think you realize who you’ve written to. But feel free to google me and you’ll see my story! Its huge and all in the News. I warn you to be careful because most of the inmates are out to pull quick scams with lies and disinformation. </br></br>Myself, I don’t want nor need nothing at all! If you’d be interested in learning a true story of all my eyes have seen in my 26 years in CDCR. I’ll gladly tell ya. As you’ll see once you google me, I am being charged with Federal Rico Case, etc. at this time. I’ve been illegally tortured here and as you’ll learn illegally housed in a mental health unit for punishment during Covid-19. </br></br>I’ve been tortured to the extent that cops came by my cell door coughing loudly, dropping their masks as they do all and my cell door, they yell at me “Covid positive” and walk off! They use everything in my life as a tool here to pressure me and torture me and are out to kill me. As you’ll read recently in the newspaper ink, what CDCR is doing to me! Check it out and write me back if youre interested in a real true story Ive lived! </br></br>Im not one of these 2nd rate low brow low I.Q. morons who’ll try to scam their sister even. And I suggest yall be very cautious with whom you deal. Thank you for your time and I look forward to hearing from you! </br></br>Take care, respectfully.
