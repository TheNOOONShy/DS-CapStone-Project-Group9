This story was told by a person incarcerated at Kings County Jail.</br></br>

Caller: It's not unusual, that right there. But what’s not okay, what’s – what’s – that's fine. But what's not fine to me is – is you – you abusing your power, you - you causing violence, you causing harm to someone else.</br></br>

You're allowing things to go on like that. Taking a life? Allowing harm, danger to be done to someone? That's what’s not right.</br></br>

You turning a blind eye? You not having cameras set up around that? That's – that’s a dangerous place to be, that prison.</br></br> 

And you not having cameras set up and things – and things you know, things there to – to show, you know what I mean? Why? Why don't you let the public see these types of things? Why?</br></br>

And that’s why I was saying, you know, that man, I thank – I thank God for the bravery that – that officer – that fellow correctional officer showed by writing in the papers. It was in the Fresno Bee. It was last week sometime.</br></br>

I don't – I don’t remember exactly what day. I don’t remember if it was, I don’t know if it was, I don’t think it was this week. I don't think it was Monday. It was either Sunday's paper or – or Friday's paper, one of those papers, newspapers, but it was the – it was the Fresno Bee.</br></br>

And you look into it and it was on the – it was on the page, they talked about the man was just saying, that he – he took his life – but before he took his life he wrote a letter. And he was in the Investigations Unit, IGI, and he – he was part of a – he investigated crimes inside of prisons, deaths, drugs, and drug visits. People trying to bring drugs in from their family members, and stuff like that.</br></br>

They would do all that investigating stuff. People stabbing victims. They investigate all that.</br></br>

And that man told the truth. He said how he was mentally and – and emotionally abused by – by his fellow coworkers because he didn't agree with those things that they were doing. Because he said there was falsified documentation going on. He said murders that were covered up, things that were allowed to happen.</br></br> 

And that’s – that’s at Folsom Prison. Look at that story. Look into that story. That's at Folsom Prison.</br></br>

And all these people – now basically, these people – the face – these wardens and these people now, these assistant wardens, people want to get on here and – and this is what happens in California State Prison. These – this, ma'am you can go everywhere around these – the state.</br></br>

In this – in this state right here – you go around to these different prisons, in this California, and you're gonna find something going on. You're gonna find something that they shouldn’t be doing – that's very much illegal. But it takes somebody like that, that has the courage like that to set everything in motion for everybody else. 

They should have an investigation done in every prison in California because they're gonna find something. If they do it right, then people are gonna lose their jobs. People are gonna lose their jobs because the things that they're doing are not right.
