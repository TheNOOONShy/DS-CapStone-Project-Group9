This story was told by a person incarcerated at San Quentin.</br></br>

Caller: I mean, you can't even keep a social distance from your cellmate or your cellie or your cell next door. If you go to the bars, there's bars, there's not doors, and that thing is bars itâ€™s wide open out into- And you got a guy you could- if you could, you could just reach around and grab his hand, let alone be socially distanced from a guy in your cell.</br></br>

So if he's got it and you don't, well, you're there- you're quarantined with him. It's- it's San Quentin was built for single cell. It was built for like a maximum of a couple of thousand.</br></br>

And when I got there in 2010, there was over 6,000 people. They had people in the gym, they had people triple bunk. Well, once they get away with it long enough to have two guys in a cell, that's- they welded the bunks in.</br></br>

They have two guys in a cell that was built for one. That's it- that becomes normal. Do that for a decade and it's well, it's just what we do.</br></br>

Well, it's unhealthy and it's wrong.
