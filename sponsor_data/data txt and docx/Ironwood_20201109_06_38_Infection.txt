This story was told by a person incarcerated at Ironwood.</br></br>

Caller: Well they started feeding us, as of yesterday they started feeding us in the buildings. On June 11th, on June 10th, I work at central health, I was confirmed as a positive, um prisoner that came up positive of COVID virus.</br></br> 

I went to, um first they placed, prior to that they moved us to the visiting, family visiting bungalows and from there they snatched me up about two o’clock in the morning and sent me to the hospital that was central health and I was held there with just basically solitary confinement for approximately 18 days.</br></br> 

From there they moved me to ad seg for another 18 days and then, all this time it was in solitary confinement basically. I was in ad seg as if, being treated as if I was an ad seg inmate that did something wrong which the only thing was wrong was that I caught COVID virus.</br></br> Because one of the staff members, I was cleaning their office and they had contracted the COVID virus and they didn’t notify us until about a week later. Then they told us not to clean the room but by then I was already infected.</br></br>

Went through all the phases, I still have headaches as of today since June 10th, oh well since June 8th, 8th, is kind of, kinda when they traced it to June 8th. But they didn’t, they didn’t isolate me until about June 11th.</br></br>Prior, and then, again, trying to get the dates right. October 18th, everybody that worked at central health or everybody that worked for PIA, they isolated again, the whole 16 of us. Isolated us and then housed us in C yard, building 1 I wanna say for approximately 14 days.</br></br> 

None of us came out positive but again, solitary confinement. Basically treating us as if we had did something wrong. From that they moved us back, they moved us from C yard which is a general population to B yard for another 14 days. From there they just, after the 14 days there, they moved us back to A yard. So actually I’ve been at every facility except family visiting, I was housed in every yard.</br></br> Apart from that I still have headaches.
