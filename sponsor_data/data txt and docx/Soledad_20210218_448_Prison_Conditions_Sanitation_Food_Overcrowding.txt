Theme: Prison Conditions: Sanitation, food, and overcrowding


As inmates, to date, we have no access to any meaningful cleaning supplies to maintain common sense sanitary measures. We are provided a highly watered-down issue of prison made disinfectant called "Cellblock 64". No that's not a joke. Purportedly, at a one to one ratio (one ounce to one gallon) this stuff kills everything. The problem is that it is never applied as the instructions indicate, which says it must be sprayed or applied to hard surfaces and left wet for 10- 15 minutes for it to be effective. Never happens. NO BLEACH!</br></br>


Moving on to other safety issues. Currently in a (put a bullet proof vest on after you've been shot) move, we are on lockdown. We are locked in our cells 24/7. We are not getting yard. We are not even getting our shower at least every 72 hours as mandated.</br></br>
Contrary to the standardized menus that are published, for public consumption, pun intended, when they put on the menu that we are being served baked ham, rice pilaf, stir fry, creamed beef, "calico scrambled eggs", broccoli alfredo, chicken tetrazzini, chicken cobb salad, etc. etc., I assure you, we see no such food as this. The food that we get would make hospital food seem like gourmet food. And I received bigger portions on my tray in second grade then we get here. I've measured it, one ounce of macaroni.</br></br>


And for those who say, “Oh poor wittle inmate in his cell hungwee" that's a good one, catchy. But I say on a more mature note, since the nature of this post was to expose prison conditions during this pandemic, I say consider your dead mother, father, grandma, grandpa, kids, friends, family members, etc., that may [be] dead because careless prison staff created a human petri dish in which this virus has spread.</br></br>
They injected it into our sterile environment, allowed it flourish, worked in and amongst it, and then come out there to the Safeway where your mother is shopping and sneeze COVID-I9 infected droplets in here vicinity and then days later you have her cremated. Now who's the criminal? Merry Christrnas! But I digress. Does this make sense?</br></br>
Currently, two inmates are housed in every cell designed for one. My cell mate coughs are posterior could never be more than three feet way a from my face. Right now, the prison, in it wisdom is doing this: if one inmate in the cell of two test positive, they move the one off to quarantine. The other stays behind. Then they move some other inmate in with the inmate that did not immediately test positive, "that time". Next thing you know the original negative inmate does test positive on a subsequent test. They move him out to quarantine and leave the other guy behind, repeat, repeat, repeat.</br></br>


The prison was unwilling and unprepared to manage this contagion even though proponents of prison reform always cite the overcrowding and “what if a contagion ever got loose in one of those prison"? well, now you don't have to wonder. This is as they announce a mutant variant seventy percent more contagious. Better get some body bags!</br></br>
