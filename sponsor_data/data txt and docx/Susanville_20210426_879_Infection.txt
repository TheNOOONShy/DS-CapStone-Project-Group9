I still am in the dorm’s tryin to stay safe when it’s testing day and not only 9 but 11 inmate’s test positive they wait to move them out of the dorm and now the game become’s more fun for the CO’s so I catch it and don’t have no symptoms right. </br></br>


I was so worry for myself I started to call home and let my family know what’s going with me cause I did not feel a thing. I was still working out and I did not believe my test result so I ask the doctor to print me a copy so I can see for my eye’s you know and next thing you know they wanted the whole yard to catch the virus so that everybody can come out and program. </br></br>


I was like this place is very very crazy if only the public can see what’s going on up here they will shut this place down for good you know they exception me to be quiet saying in all reality you have no voice sorry my mother gave me a month and a voice so this is what’s happening up here they say god doe’s not like ugly well these people know they’re wrong but they continue to treat people like they are nothing at all. </br></br>


CCC to much wrong doing for one day the next day I just stay out of they way cause they’re out to get inmate’s and give out 115’s and that’s a write up that keep us in here longer then our date’s were human too you know that but that don’t stop them from comin in to work mad at their outside world and most of the time I just stay to myself and stay out of the CO’s face so they can’t found anything to write me up about cause I’m trying to go home and be with my family and start me a nice shoe line or clothing line for the kid’s you know.
