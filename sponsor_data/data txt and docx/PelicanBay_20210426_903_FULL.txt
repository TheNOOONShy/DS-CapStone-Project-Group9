Dear UCI PrisonPandemic,</br></br>

Before I begin, I would like to take this opportunity to thank you for reaching out to one such as myself. It means a lot to know that there are individuals out there in the free world whom in our corner and believe in us as we finish our trials and tribulations here, to eventually return to our loved ones and be productive members the contribution to our communities.</br></br>

Thank you, I truly appreciate all of you at UC Irvine and all out there for them are helping us in any way big or small. I too hope that all of you are well and your loved ones are in the best of health and their spirits are uplifted.</br></br>

I too am a college student working on my degree through a community college. Which I believe is far from Irvine. However, with COVID-19 I haven’t been able to take any classes due to social distancing. I am at a standstill until we get a better grip on this virus. I am 15 units away from graduating and I wanted to be done and move on to my bachelors degree, but will have to wait.</br></br>

It truly is a crazy time in our lives, and a sad and trying time for our families around the world. When it all started in January, I went to a medical appointment and was conversing with a CO who escorted me, and the feeling was it wouldn’t be so bad and it would all blow over in a month or so! Boy were we wrong!</br></br>

Next thing you know, visits state wide are canceled and still remain so to date. Masks are passed out, staff and CO looks like they are grown up with face shields getting ready for surgery. All groups, religious services, etc. all out to a halt. It was honestly kind of scary. And segregation we were allowed two phone calls a month, due to no visits, as a way to stay in touch with our loved ones.</br></br>

You have to wear your mask during the 15 minute phone call and the phone is disinfected before each use. Unprecedented doesn’t begin to describe it! On the news daily all the loss of life and sadness and the toll it has taken on our frontline workers. I am amazed at the resilience of our healthcare workers. They are angels on earth and true heroes. Then in September it looks like the worst is over.</br></br>

They start to run groups and staff then in October, it gets really crazy. I am in a unit in a section with myself and four other people, that’s it! Normally that section house is 16 people! Four cells on the bottom tier, four cells on the top-tier, two inmates per cell. Two cells down from me a guy has COVID and is quarantined.</br></br>

COVID-19 is here at Pelican Bay. And just like the wildfires we had around the prison, COVID-19 is moving just as fast. My whole unit was quarantined and I tested negative and luckily never got the virus.</br></br>
 
My step mom got the virus. My youngest son and his cousin got the virus. I lost four loved ones during June through September. Not one from COVID but it all adds up and takes a toll with all that is going on. I felt relatively safe during all this as I have been by myself and in a cell during the whole time, but was unsure as to how the virus can move in carry.</br></br>

And if I got it how would it hit me? Like a bee sting or a Mack truck? I guess the unknown was the thing that is most scary.</br></br>

It has been hard, especially being in here handcuffed and completely helpless to be there to comfort my loved ones. And they are really scared and worried about me. It really is a lot of stress for anyone to deal with!</br></br>

All you can do is write letters and try your best to be comforting through a pen and paper sending your loved ones verbal hugs and kisses delivered through the tip of a Bic pen. It’s really tough! Every phone call you get, you brace yourself for bad news and heartache and if it doesn’t come you are relieved.</br></br>

But 30 minutes of conversation with your loved one is nowhere near enough especially during this time with everything going on so it really is bittersweet. Add to that, you can only call two of your loved ones each month and you have to pick and choose who to call and who to leave out. It sucks!</br></br>

For example, I haven’t been able to speak to my kid's mother or my son for over a month, due to the fact that when they come to your door to offer you a call it’s the only chance you get period. My kid's mother works graveyard so in the morning she is asleep. But at 9 a.m. here comes the CO that you either get a hold of your loved ones or you don’t.</br></br>

Even trying to explain the situation is a moot point because no exceptions are made. It’s really frustrating and nerve-racking because during the whole time you are just worried and concerned for their health and safety. All you can do is hope the next time they come for your phone call it is at a time where you can reach your loved ones and not again at 9 a.m. where you are filled with disappointment and frustration.</br></br>

As for the vaccinations, they came through in December or early January, but I didn’t get it because a few concerns and questions I had couldn’t be answered, so it discouraged me. Then just last week they sent me a notice that I could get the vaccine by submitting a medical request. However, one of the vaccines was the J&J vaccine and with the blood clot situation again I am not encouraged to get it until I feel it is safer. It’s just crazy times, to say the least.</br></br>

I feel safer than my loved ones and I worry about them. My loved ones feel safer than me and worry about me here! And I can’t help but feel for the people who lost loved ones due to this virus. It is a very difficult time indeed and 2020 was a year that we collectively couldn’t wait for. Now all the world wants to do is forget it ever existed.</br></br>

Personally, I want to remember it and learn from it so the same mistakes aren’t repeated and we once again face with something similar or even more deadly. As I write these words it is April of 2021, and we are at this very moment in quarantine day number eight because someone or someone has been contacted with the virus and once again COVID is in Pelican Bay.</br></br>

So I stayed in my cell alone, socially distance, breathing in air that is circulated through the building hoping the virus doesn’t have the strength to penetrate my safety bubble and infect me. I said here hoping that I get an evening phone call so I can hear my kids and their mother's voice for 15 minutes, and be reassured that they are safe and healthy. Then I will worry about them until the next opportunity comes along.</br></br>

I stayed here by myself a day before my 38th birthday with seven more to face away from my loved ones. I am doing everything I can within my capabilities to stay safe, be positive, productive, and hope that soon this will all be over, and we can put this separation behind us and enjoy one another’s company as a family united.</br></br>

Making memories and cherishing stored up moments that will eventually overcome the sad, lonely, and difficult trying times. All one can do is go, have faith, and put in the work to make it so. This I believe!</br></br>

Well I thank you for reaching out and allowing me to share my story. I hope it helps someone, somewhere, and spreads hope to the next person and so on. We all know we can use any positivity we can get. Take care and stay safe.</br></br>

Best wishes.
