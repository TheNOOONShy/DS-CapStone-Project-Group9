To whom it may concern,</br></br>
Hi UCI student! Thank you for showing some interest in the situation at hand. I hope my letter helps you with your studies.</br></br> 
Here’s my story. I personally have had a very bad luck with COVID-19.</br></br> 

In November 2019, I was sent back to court in San Diego to get my sentence changed. While I was out to court, I got very ill in December 2019. At that time there was no test for COVID. Well I got better so I didn’t think much of it.</br></br> 

In January 2020 the dorm that I was in got put on quarantine the day that I got transferred to Chino. They still transferred me, although the dorm was quarantined and the guy that they transferred in a super small cage and handcuffed together was snotted out of every orifice.</br></br> 

After my second day at Chino, I felt sick again. On the third or fourth day, they transferred me back here to Tehachapi. By the time I got here, I was so sick. When they checked me in here I told them I was sick and asked for medical aid, which I did not get. I was sick for months. I finally got over it.</br></br> 

I was good for months, but my life is highly affected by COVID right now! I am not sick, but I am being treated like it. We have been on different quarantine stages for months. As of right now, December 2020, we are on 23 hours lockdown, and we don’t know when it will be over.</br></br> 

It's like we are being punished. I also had my job taken from me which was my only source of income. Now I have to wait for God knows when to get reassigned to who knows what job. It took me over a year to get the job I had. Anyways, nobody likes a complainer so that’s my story.</br></br>Thank you.
