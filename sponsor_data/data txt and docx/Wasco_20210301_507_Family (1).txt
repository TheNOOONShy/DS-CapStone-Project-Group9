This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Wasco. </br></br>
We had been on and off quarantine for another month and week. We still got to use the phone twice a week, but that got cut down to once a week, then it was more of a hit and miss. Anyways, this pandemic has done a lot to us. </br></br>
From what I’ve been told by other inmates. Some have been here for a year because of the pandemic, some have stayed here because the prison they were endorsed to shut down. Not only what’s been going in here is stressful. </br></br>
The cancellation of visits has been pretty bad. I was in county when all visits were cancelled. I had to adjust to not seeing my parents and my girlfriend every weekend. </br></br>
Obviously, I can call them but, we all know it not the same. I had to spend almost a year not seeing my girlfriend. My parents I haven’t seen them because they are not technologically savvy. But seeing one is better than none. </br></br>
