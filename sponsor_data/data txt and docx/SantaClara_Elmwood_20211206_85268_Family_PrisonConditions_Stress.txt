This story was told by a person incarcerated at Elmwood Correctional Facility.</br></br>Caller: Yeah, a lot of movements and other things have delayed. Like visitation sometimes we don't get visitations, or sometimes they don't allow us to go to our court dates because the COVID surge. Yeah, that's the things get put on pause sometimes. Sometimes they don't allow any movements at all.</br></br> 

Or like if we test positive and they move us to lockdown facility, sometimes they don't let out - let us out our cells for like four or five days at a time. No showers, no phones, no contact with the outside. So yeah, gets very bad sometimes.</br></br>UCI: What else do you want people to know about your experience?</br></br>Caller: It's very hard because we got family members out there that, that do test positive sometimes, and there's not really much we could do about it, you know? So we got to deal with our loved ones outside of the walls, risking their life or having to worry about their life being took from this virus that we can't control. And yet, we're stuck in here having to deal with the same thing. And it almost feels like you’re a lab rat or something like, you're trapped in the cage, and you can't really do much.</br></br>But see some people suffer. Or, you know, there's not much we could do, we're just stuck here. And you would think that would be safe, because we're like, away from everybody else. And we're away from the public.</br></br> 

But that really isn’t the case being so people in here get test positive, and then it's kind of - you feel like you're stuck in with the virus itself. And you can't really do much to escape it, but you know, just kind of hope for the best.
