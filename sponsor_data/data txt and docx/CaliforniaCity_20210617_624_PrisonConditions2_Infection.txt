This story was told by a person incarcerated at California City.</br></br> 

UCI: Have you seen an increase in people coming in, though, now that restrictions have been lifted?</br></br>

Caller: You have people - we just started - they just started the other day. They just - 36 people transpack to go to fire camps and other facilities, but you still have people that's coming from other facilities here. They're all on A-1 and A-2 side, you know, because they've got to be quarantined for the 14 - for the 14 days before they can come in the population where we at.</br></br>

UCI: Wow. That's very interesting. And with this kind of shift in people coming in, has there been a push to get vaccinated at your facility?</br></br>

Caller: The question is - that's a good question there because it's two people that came in here. They said they came straight off the bus to here when they should've went to quarantine for 14 days. So, I don't know if they're vaccinated or not, but I have been vaccinated already, I took both of the shots. Then, everybody that's already in my pod been vaccinated already.
