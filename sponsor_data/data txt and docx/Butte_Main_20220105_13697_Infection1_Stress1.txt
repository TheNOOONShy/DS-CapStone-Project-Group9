This story was told by a person incarcerated at Butte County Main Jail.</br></br>

Caller: It’s kind of like, heartbreaking to see other people break down because their loved ones are passing away due to COVID. You know, now there’s a stronger COVID. I mean, like my story says, COVID in 2001, then a stronger COVID, flu number two, and then now there’s the corona, whatever it is, coronavirus, whatever they said it was.</br></br>

You know, like, it’s getting worser and worser. And probably a lot of people are going through it. You know? Like, I’ve seen a lot of pain and sorrow in here, and I think it's heartbreaking that they can’t see their loved ones. You know? Like, it’s crazy.</br></br> 

UCI: Yeah, it is crazy. How is the officers there, like, the staff? How have they been handling it?</br></br>

Caller: Well, they run around with their little masks on. The medical here is not good, you know. Like, they, people complain, and then nothing. They just ignore people, you know. So, yeah. I think they should have a better medical response team here. But.</br></br>

UCI: You said that they ignore people?</br></br>

Caller: Huh?</br></br>

UCI: You said that they ignore people?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, they ignore people sometimes. You know, like, my friend was talking about, like, he had a broken spleen. And they ignored him for two days, three days. You know?</br></br>

And they finally came and seen him today. You know? He could’ve died. You know, they just, I guess, their medical is not that good.</br></br>

UCI: Geez. Wow.</br></br>

Caller: I just complained about my knee today and they just ignored me. I ripped one of my ligaments and I need an MRI and some type of surgery, and they were like, “Oh, well, we can’t do nothing for you.” So I’m supposed to limp around with a messed up leg. I’ve been doing it for eight months.</br></br>

UCI: For eight months?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, for eight months.</br></br>

UCI: Geez.</br></br>

Caller: With ripped ligaments in my knee.</br></br> 

UCI: So, even if you said you had COVID or anything like that, they wouldn’t respond that quickly?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, they - they – I mean, I’ve already submitted grievances to them, I’ve threatened to sue them, and they still don’t want do nothing.</br></br>

UCI: Wow.</br></br>

Caller: Like, the medical here is just, like, they don’t even care about us. They treat us like, the last of the worst of the worst. Just because we’re in here, because what? We’re poor, and sometimes we gotta commit crimes to survive.
