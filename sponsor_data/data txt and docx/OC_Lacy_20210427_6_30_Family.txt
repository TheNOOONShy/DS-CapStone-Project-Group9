This story was told by a person incarcerated at OC Lacey. </br></br>


I got a good family support system too. So that's a big plus, you know? </br></br>


UCI: Yeah that’s great. How has the COVID situation affected your loved ones? </br></br>


Caller: I mean, a lot because I mean, just last month was like the first time I hadn't seen eim in a long time, you know? And, you know, I messed up the prices on the phones, but it’s still the same you know, I mean, you would think they will like at least cut em down a little bit you know what I mean.  </br></br>


Like since we couldn’t see our loved ones like we’re gonna obviously be using the phone a lot more, you know. I think the right thing to do was to like at least cut back on the on the phone price, but I mean, just it just gets it got more expensive you hear me.  </br></br>


It was already expensive, especially I’m fighting a live case so like it, you know, it gets really expensive after a while, you know, like the store and then like, you don't want to eat sack lunches all day every day. So like, so you're wasting more on commissary, you get me like, like, everything just using, like, everything just cost more, you know? </br></br>


UCI: Mhmm.  </br></br>


Caller: Uh. So. That’s pretty much it but uh. My loved ones, I mean, they're good. You know, I'm just like, well, now they're good, because we got a visit you know, but yeah, just they cost a lot more, pretty much. </br></br>


UCI: So what would- what would have made the situation at your facility better, do you think? </br></br>


Caller: Well, that, you know, like, like, like I said, the the phone thing- they should have, like, cut back on the prices. You know what I mean, like all they did, honestly, all they did was they gave us two free calls: two five minute free calls, right? Two five minute free calls each, right?  </br></br>


And you know what I mean, and those five minutes, they go by like three minutes, you know, that's once once a week, which is cool, you know, I'll take whatever I can get, you know, it’s free, you know, but that's not enough.  </br></br>


You know, I mean, and then like, with the store, they should have cut back on the prices or you know what I mean? It just got a lot more expensive, like a lot of the workflow out there slowed down, so they should have like thought about like, our families too, you hear me.  </br></br>


UCI: Mhmm.  </br></br>


Caller: I think that would’ve made it better, if they would have cut back on- on the price.
