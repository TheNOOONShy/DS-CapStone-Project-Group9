This story was told by a person incarcerated at Theo Lacy.</br></br>


So, you know, the struggles are still going on. There’s a lot of things that we’re still experiencing. A lot of retaliation for speaking out. And just, you know, an oppressive system that tries to separate us from our families, from our communities.</br></br> 


I know that many of us, including myself, have made mistakes. And, you know, I know that from speaking to guys in here, and this includes myself, we. We hold ourselves accountable for what we’ve done. We know that we’ve made mistakes.</br></br>


But to be treated the way that we have been treated throughout this whole year, I think it says a lot about the way that law enforcement sees us and the way that they are able to get away with things. I just hope that from this experience that people will pay a little more attention to what goes on behind bars and hopefully, you know, use their voice, use their vote and their power to change this punitive system that is not solving any problems, is not helping the problem with mass incarceration and it’s not rehabilitating anybody.</br></br>


There’s people like me that need help. We ask for help, we want to participate in rehabilitated programs and be able to become better people, so that when we return to our societies we can contribute. But all we see is walls.</br></br> 


You know, I’m in my cell nearly 23-hours a day and just. Absolutely no opportunities to rehabilitate myself, in a way that I know would help me so that I can return to society and contribute, and give back.</br></br> 


But, you know, we’re still, we’re still pushing through, we’re still doing our best, we’re being resilient and trying to just overcome all the obstacles and burdens that we must deal with in here. But you know, at the end of the day it’s really the people out there that are making the difference. And I’m thankful to everyone, to every advocate, to every person that has spoken up and that believes that we deserve better treatment.</br></br> 


People that believe that we are not just humans in name only, and I believe that with more people like this real change will come and if anything good has come out of this, is the fact that more people are paying attention and are listening to our struggles and to our experiences.</br></br>
