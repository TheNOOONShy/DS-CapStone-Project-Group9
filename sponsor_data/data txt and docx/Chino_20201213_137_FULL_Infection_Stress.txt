Dear friend,</br></br>

I want to thank you for the opportunity to manifest COVID-19 pandemic widespread outbreak disease, it’s been horrifying coping with this crisis. I myself contracted the virus back in May 5, 2020. I was rush to the primary care clinic about May the 26, 2020. June 8, 2020 CDCR medical is testing people for COVID-19 based on symptoms or other factors.</br></br>

CSCP, Avenal, CIM, CIW, COR, SQ, CEN, WASCO, CAC, LAC, And CMC. Important advice regarding COVID-19/coronavirus experts say it is crucial to avoid close contact with people as much as possible to reduce the chances of catching or spreading the virus. Many people who have the virus and are contagious have no symptoms or only minor ones. So you may not know if you or others are infected and can infect others.</br></br> 

It is safest to assume that anyone can have the virus, and to reduce contact in order to protect yourself and those most vulnerable to COVID-19.</br></br> 

It depends on your age and health. In some people, COVID-19 leads to serious problems like pneumonia, not getting enough oxygen, heart problems, or even death. This risk gets higher as people get older.

What has it been like to have reduced visitation from family and loved ones.</br></br>
