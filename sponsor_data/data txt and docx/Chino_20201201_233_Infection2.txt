This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Chino.</br></br>

The medical staff at Riverside was great. They treated me like a human being, provided me with hygiene items to clean myself and shave. The C/O's tasked with "guarding" me chained me to the bed. I had to pee in a bedside bottle. Pooping required me to ask hospital staff to locate the C.O's and have them unchain me so I could use the toilet about 5' from the bed. (The C.O.'s complained about it every time.)</br></br> 

This wasn't a problem for the first four days, because antibacterial I.V.'s leave you unable to poop. However, once doctors give laxatives to solve that, getting C.O's to unchain you BEFORE you have pooped yourself in the bed, became a "problem". (On the last day I was at Riverside, an officer who didn't want to be bothered with responding at all, simply got a longer chain - allowing me to just go to the toilet whenever necessary.</br></br> 

Riverside Hospital discharged me on the day before Memorial Day. My 02 levels were consistently at or above 90%. For some reason, the prison decided to keep me in THEIR clinic (aka "hospital") for another 12 days - until my 02 levels reached 95%+. Prison C.O.'s working the clinic were annoyed I had no clothes or I.D., and complained at having to find clothes and generate a "bed card" off the computer.</br></br> 

I was put in one of their "rooms" around 8:30 p.m. A C.O. threw me a shredded pair of cast-off state prison pants that reached my knees - and looked like Robinson Caruso had worn them. I also received a state prison shirt, towel, and blanket and sheet. But no shoes, underwear, socks, or T-shirt. The room itself had a sink, toilet, hospital-type bed, and a small table on wheels. There was a 3'X 3' window in the back wall for sunlight. The room was about 10' X 15', with 18' ceilings - all concrete, painted various shades of white to offset the broken linoleum floor.
