This story was told by a person incarcerated at Avenal.</br></br>Caller: Well to me it just seems that the way that they; instead of you know, like I said you know way back in March you know they shut everything down. So, the chapel was closed, the classrooms were closed, any of the vocations that were going on or any self-help groups that were going on where inmates were coming together from different buildings you know and in any you know large group setting was basically squashed you know. And to try to confine the spread you know, and masks were issued to all the inmates.</br></br>
And there was a point there where they-, there was a point there when they were you know bringing meals to the building to try to you know kinda stop the spread and stuff and you know it did spread pretty much like wildfire.</br></br>
And then you know they forgot that how widespread it’d gotten, and they just seemed to still just be moving inmates you know just it seemed willy nilly and not really doing the shelter in place and the confined to quarters that the CDC and the WHO has kind of instituted for the rest of you know basically the world you know. And you know if somebody goes out to work and gets infected you know they don’t want even those people coming back to their families you know.</br></br>
And so, they’re telling them to go and quarantine elsewhere until that 14 days is up so that way they can go back to their families and not infect everyone. And you know it just seems that the movement that they’re doing isn’t doing that and it's just cross contaminating the yards and keeping the pandemic going here.
