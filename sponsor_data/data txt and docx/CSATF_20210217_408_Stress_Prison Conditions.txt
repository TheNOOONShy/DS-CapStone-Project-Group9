Life in prison is hard enough to begin with, throw in the added stress of a global pandemic, and it could begin to feel unbearable. My, and many other individual’s, experience has been difficult this past year. Normal routines have changed drastically and programs has diminished.</br></br>

Small comforts such as seeing our families and loved ones have been taken away. We have had to find new and creative ways to cope with our situation. In these uncertain times it’s hard not to wonder, whether today or tomorrow may be my last day of full health.</br></br>

During this time of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have been placed on what is called “modified program.” This means that our regular program schedule is affected. With the amount of yard and dayroom time we receive being reduced by about half.</br></br>

We are supposed to get 2 and a half hours of yard every day, when we are on “normal program.” But we usually end up getting about one hour and a half. That’s as long as we are not on “fog watch,” “short on staff,” or any other common excuse that we get now we get one hour and a half every other day, if we are lucky and they run program like they’re supposed to.</br></br>

There are eight buildings on this yard, before the pandemic two buildings used to go out to yard together. It is now one building at a time per yard schedule. Each building, or “block,” is divided into three sections; A, B, and C section, there are two tiers in each section. Under normal programs, each section would get one hour of dayroom, both top and bottom tiers at the same time.</br></br>

Now we have been coming out split tier program for dayroom, with the lower tier coming out for half an hour, and the upper tier coming out separately for their own half hour. Anytime we come out of our cells, whether for program or to go to medial we are required to wear face masks.</br></br> 

I never thought I would experience something like this in my life. The severity of the situation didn’t really set in until the correctional officers (CO’s) started passing out face masks one day. These face masks were made out of old prison clothing, pretty much just a layer of cloth with elastic bands. We had to use the same masks for about three to four months without them being replaced.</br></br>

Of course there is some concern about how effective they were in preventing the spread of Corona virus. Especially, since many people in various prisons throughout the state of California have gotten sick, with some even losing their lives. The prison I am housed at, SATF-Corcoran, has had a few mass outbreaks.</br></br>

In fact, there has been a little more than 6,000 cases of COVID-19 between three prisons (SATFC, Corcoran S.P., and Avenal S.P), about 30 min. away from each other. It is hard not to worry or feel some form of anxiety being in this situation. We are fortunate that we have not had a mass outbreak on the yard I am housed in.</br></br>
