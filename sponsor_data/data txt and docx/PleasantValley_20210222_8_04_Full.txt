This story was told by a person incarcerated at Pleasant Valley.</br></br>

Caller: As of right now, there's not- the numbers kinda went down on our facility yard- on our yard. Kinda going down as we speak. But, there's still, how do I say it? There's been some people catching the virus still.</br></br>

UCI: Mhmm.</br></br>

Caller: Other than that it's just been a little stressful because we don't really have as much program, like we would you know?</br></br>

UCI: Mhmm.</br></br>

Caller: Like, meaning like, coming outside, or going to school, or having any visits. Or anything like that. Yeah.</br></br>

UCI: I see. So how was COVID-19 handled at your facility at the beginning of the outbreak, and is it being handled differently now?</br></br>

Caller: Well, when it first happened it was pretty bad, the way they were handling it.</br></br>

UCI: Mhmm.</br></br>

Caller: And I mean, I think they were- I think they could have handled it a lot better, than what they did. They should have handled it a lot better but now they got better at it. So now everything's kinda like, the numbers are going down now.</br></br>

UCI: I see.</br></br>

Caller: So other than that, we're okay.</br></br>

UCI: And is it okay if I ask you like, a semi-personal question?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, that's okay.</br></br>

UCI: How has COVID-19 affected you like, mentally? Are there- is there anything you do to destress? Or are you affected emotionally at all by what's happening?</br></br> 

Caller: Well yeah because I'm affected emotionally because I'm not able to see my family. So that kinda gets me down and out. Or my kids or anything like that, you know?</br></br>

UCI: Mhmm.</br></br>

Caller: And, so like what I do with that, I usually draw, or I do some homework, because they've been giving us some homework. And then like, when I'm done doing that, I'll do a little bit of reading here and there. And then I'll just work out. I work out every day, so like, I try to keep myself going every day, you know?</br></br>

UCI: And were you, or have you been able to speak with your family for the past few months?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah. Off and on, here and there, yeah.</br></br>

UCI: OK.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah.</br></br>

UCI: And how has the COVID-19 situation at your facility affected your loved ones?</br></br>

Caller: Oh man, well, for this happening, it kinda stopped me from leaving to another prison, because of the transfers and all that stuff. Because they're not transferring anybody right now.</br></br>  

And I kinda- I've never been to a level two, so I kinda wanted to get to go to a level two. But since all this happened, now I gotta stay here for a while. I mean, which is fine with me. But still, I kinda wanted to see how a level two was, because I heard it's nice over there, and it's a little bit more open and free, you know?</br></br>

UCI: And is there anything else that's going on in the prison? How is COVID-19 being handled? Sorry if I'm repeating myself by the way.</br></br>

Caller: That's okay. Well, it's being handled alright. They check up on everybody, like every other week. Right now, I'm in a building right now where they're handling some of the COVIDs, so like, but they keep us segregated. I already caught the COVID.</br></br>

UCI: Oh.</br></br>

Caller: I think I caught it like, about two months ago? But I probably still have the- I'm probably still infected still, you know what I mean? But yeah.</br></br>

UCI: Can you tell me a little bit more about that? How was your experience with having COVID while at the prison?</br></br>

Caller: Aw man, it was pretty- it sucked. Because usually on the streets when you catch COVID, you get to go to the hospital. You get to- you know stay in the hospital and get treated. In here you don't get treated, you just get checked on. And then they just check your temperature, and they ask you questions and then they just walk away from you, you know what I mean?</br></br>

UCI: Mhmm. And-</br></br>

Caller: Other than that, I don't get any other help besides that, you know?</br></br>

UCI: What would make the situation at your facility better?</br></br>

Caller: What would make the situation- oh man. Just more nurses, you know, being present on the yard, you know would help us out more, and checking up on us more often would be better.</br></br>

UCI: I see.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah.</br></br>

UCI: And what else do you want people to know about your experience?</br></br>

Caller: Aw man. That it's sad being in here knowing that, you know, you can't really, you know keep in contact with your family like we used to. I feel like we're caged up again, you know what I mean?</br></br> 

And I feel like- I just feel like really closed off, you know what I mean? Like, there's really not much we can do, just to use the phone and stuff like that. And yeah, it kinda sucks.</br></br>

UCI: What kind of activities do you do?</br></br>

Caller: Well I just, well I kinda watch TV a lot. I just kick it and watch TV and hang out. I try to watch some different channels, and then, I just watch TV. I read a lot of magazines and stuff like that.</br></br> 

And then I just wait until the morning comes. They feed us breakfast in the morning. And in the morning, I'm a porter, a porter is like someone that cleans and stuff like that.</br></br>

UCI: Mhmm.</br></br>

Caller: So like I clean the facility. I help sanitize the facility for a little bit. For like, about an hour and like 10, 15 minutes. And then we wipe down all the railings and all that stuff. And then, usually we're done by like 9:30 or something.</br></br> 

And then after that they let us take a shower. And then we hang out in the cell for a little bit, I usually take a nap for a little bit. And after that, I'm done taking a nap, I probably get up like around, like 10, and drink some more coffee and hang out. Do a little bit more writing.</br></br>

UCI: Mhmm.</br></br>

Caller: Read a little bit, I like reading cosmo magazine. So that kinda like keeps me entertained with the world, at least a little bit. And after that I do some working out. And then I kinda just repeat that every day, you know, just to stay focused you know?</br></br>

UCI: I'm just curious, when at the height of the pandemic, we're prisoners allowed to, just have the same routine as now or was it restricted?</br></br>

Caller: Well it was restricted because we used to be able to go out to yard every day. And you know, everyone, when you go to yard you usually have your daily routine, you know what I mean? You get to go outside, you get to work out, do certain stuff.</br></br>

Or, go to school, because I used to go to school from 10 to 12 and now we don't go to school no more. So its kinda like, we don't have in person classes right now.</br></br>

UCI: What school did you go to? Or under what program?</br></br>

Caller: It's just a GED program, that they have right here.</br></br> 

UCI: Oh, OK.</br></br>

Caller: I'm trying to get my high school diploma. Or my GED, either one. Yeah.</br></br>

UCI: How do you like that program, or, back when it was running?</br></br>

Caller: It was cool. It was good because if I graduated from that class I get six months knocked off my case. So, that would be a big help, you know?</br></br>

UCI: Mhmm.
