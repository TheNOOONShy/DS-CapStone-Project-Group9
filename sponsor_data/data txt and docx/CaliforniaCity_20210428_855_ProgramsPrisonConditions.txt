This letter was written by someone at California City.</br></br>


My name is [redacted] and I’m a 32 year old man paying my debt to society. Unfortunately, I made a few mistakes in my life that led to my incarceration at the age of 24. Thank God this nightmare is coming to an end soon, for I am ready to move on with my life.</br></br>


Recently, serving my sentence has become more difficult. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, this prison CAC has implemented several changes. They began around March of 2020 with the cancelation of visits, restricted movement and locking us down 22 hours of the day. All this to prevent the spread of COVID, which did not happen until around November.</br></br>


During this modified program, inmates have not been able to go to work, go to school, go to any self help groups or walk to the dining hall for meals. We were not allowed to interact with anyone outside our pod. It went from going to yard everyday with the other three buildings (four in total with three pods each and 100 inmates per pod) to going to yard maybe twice a week with only my pod, of course.</br></br>


Dayroom used to be open 10 hours out of the day. This is when everyone in the pod is allowed out the cell to watch TV, use the phones, shower, and socialize with the other inmates. Since March, each cell is let out one hour and, if we are lucky, I have to make my phone calls and take a shower in that hour or I’ll miss out. One good thing that helped was the free phone calls provided by Global Tel Link. I was able to call people that may not be able to put money on the phone on the consistent basis.</br></br> 


In November, when several inmates tested positive, the institution shut everything down for two months. I was not able to call my relatives for the holidays. We did not get out our cells for those two months. Of course, we suffered the consequences when one of these correctional officers brought the virus into the facility. We don’t have contact with anyone else but them. At this time, nurses started checking our temperature maybe twice a week. Any individual that had symptoms would be moved to a building with other quarantined inmates.
