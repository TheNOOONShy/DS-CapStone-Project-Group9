This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Victorville.</br></br>My name is [redacted]. I got your information from my cellmate. I thought I could write you and share my story about this COVID-19 pandemic.</br></br>Before I came to Victorville USP I was in Washington State serving a five year sentence. While being locked up the pandemic hit the prisons real bad that the COs, the warden, and all the staffs didn’t know what to do.</br></br>A CO that was running the maintenance crew got sick and thought he just had the flu, but really had COVID. He kept showing up to work coughing real bad and wouldn’t take days off and that’s when an inmate caught COVID and was sick really bad. So they ended up giving the CO and the inmate a COVID test and ended up testing positive.</br></br>The prison wasn’t trying to give us any information about what was going on and just locked us in our cells for one week straight with no showers, no phone calls to our families, had to eat sandwiches every day. Not all the prison was on lockdown, just one unit at a time.</br></br>The COs that worked in the unit with all the people who tested positive would leave that unit and go into different units that tested negative and would cough everywhere. We would complain to the warden or the captain and they would just blow us off like it was nothing. Then we ended up catching COVID because of the COs that were reckless and didn’t care. That’s when they tested us and ended up positive.</br></br>So then they started moving all the inmates that tested positive to the gym and cleared out our unit and moved all the inmates that were negative to the unit that all the positive inmates used to be in. That didn’t make no sense. When they could've kept everyone in their regular units and just quarantined us. But that didn’t happen and that’s when everyone ended up catching COVID-19.</br></br>I personally caught COVID-19 bad. I lost my smell, my taste, and was coughing real bad that sometimes I couldn’t breathe. The only way I stopped coughing was I had to lay on my stomach. It sounds crazy but it worked. I couldn’t eat much and was losing weight.</br></br>I also seen people just lay in their bed with their bodies hurting real bad and couldn’t move. I had to get the nurses attention and let them know that they needed to really help these people out because they weren’t taking us serious. So we all came together and really complained about how we were feeling and for them to help us out.</br></br>I’ve done seen older inmates that had medical problems passed out dead cold and they had to use the chest paddles to bring them back. That was scary to see.</br></br>
So then after we stayed in the gym or different units for three months. They decided to move us back to our regular units and then decide to start giving the older inmates and inmates that had medial problems the vaccine. I didn’t get it because I’ve seen inmates that were allergic to it and was getting blood clots or swelling up or breaking out. So that scared me.</br></br>I told them the only way I would get it if they would let me take it in the hospital and they told me no. The nurses in prison are slow and I rather have nurses from the hospital. I would never take the vaccine while in prison.</br></br>Now they transferred me to federal prison to do my violation and it’s real hard because we barley come out or get to talk to our families or even get to visit them and that sucks. We can really only rely on letters through mail. We get two 15 minute phone calls every 30 days and that’s not right.</br></br>The vaccinations in prison are not mandatory and they don’t force nobody. I’ve done made it through this pandemic just fine. I still take the pandemic serious because I’ve seen people die from it and know someone personally who almost died from it and its scary.</br></br>
