This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Vacaville.</br></br>

I’m going to miss my deadline because my unit is on April 23, 2021 quarantine. So I won’t have any access to the Law Library for 14 days. You need to have a negative COVID-19 test. That was done on April 23, 2021.</br></br>

I requested a van for my wheelchair accountability. I should have not been on the CDCR bus for transfer. I was at Tracy medical office. The CDCR bus picked me up and put me in the back of the CDCR bus next to the bathroom for transfer to Solano.</br></br>

I request for a van with wheelchair access before they put me on the CDCR bus, but it was not granted and still put me in the CDCR bus. No info was given to me about my location. I should not have been placed on the CDCR bus back to the location where I was injured. DVI should have called Solano for proper housing with wheelchair access for me before the transfer.</br></br>

If they would have called them up, they would have found out that you was at Solano hospital because that is where I ended up in a wheelchair because of those incidents. I end up with screws and plates in my throat without my Vincent. I suffered an injury and was eating food through a straw for 23 months.</br></br>

Neglection of Medical Treatment: In August 2018, I notified medical that I was having bad stomach pain and asked to be checked out for my pain. My request for medical treatment was denied and 30 minutes later I was running to the bathroom to vomit. I told an RN I had vomited and she ignored me.</br></br>

So I went back to my room and 10 minutes later I was running back to the restroom to vomit again. Walking out of the bathroom I got light headed and fell on the ground. My RN stayed at her work station while every other nurse came to help.
