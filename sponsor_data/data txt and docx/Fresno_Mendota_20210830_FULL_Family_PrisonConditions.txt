I hope this letter finds its way into the right hands, minds, and hearts and women, men, and young adults that want change from the inadequacy in our federal and state prison. If you have bared witness to the hazards, the hospitalization and death of this COVID-19 pandemic in our public, meaning schools, homes, jobs, and worksites that news and government alike cover the truth. Just think what is going on behind the barbed wire fences and walls of the board of prisons?</br></br>

I can only tell my story and compared to others really isn’t that bad because I only have a 10 month sentence. But you would think that because my probation violation came from me working driving a truck all over the state of Montana and missing my UAs during a pandemic, that I would get house arrest or something like that right? “Nope” welcome to being “Black in COVID times.”</br></br>

I went from having a preemie baby girl that weighed two pounds, 14 ounces in November 2020 to starting my LLC going to online college to FCI Victorville yard two medium high by May 2021 for what the judge called bad communication on my part with my probation officer. Upon arriving at Victorville the lieutenant handed everyone one envelope and said “write your loved one and tell them they won’t be hearing from you for a month.”</br></br>

And yes he meant it. No phone, no paper, no envelopes. A shower every three days, no commissary the first two weeks with the only food item being cough drops and high-priced “Bob Barker” products. I didn’t hear or speak to my kids and family for 30 something days. No outside time for another 24 days, which once again no phone or email during that time.</br></br>

It was almost two months before I was feeling direct sunlight on my face besides during transport. During this whole ordeal the staff is pushing for us to take the COVID vaccine shot. I know two people who took the shot and both got sick. One’s hair started falling out and the other thought he was going to die in his sleep so he stayed awake for three days.</br></br>

I’ve been on two different lockdowns at FCI Mendota due to staff having brung COVID on to the compound, both resulting in inmates being locked in a cell for weeks at a time. At times I’ve felt like just a number in the prison system to a lab rat like a “Tuskigee Airman,” so I stay grounded in my family and always thankful for the love of my family waiting on my return back to them. But like I said in the beginning of this letter, my story “really isn’t that bad” compared to most.</br></br>

To whom it may concern.</br></br>
