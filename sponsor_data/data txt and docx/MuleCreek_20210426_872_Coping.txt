This letter was written by someone incarcerated at Mule Creek.</br></br>

When a person tested positive they began quarantine in the gymnasium. Weekly tests continued in the cell blocks where the non-mobile bunks existed. As long as you did not show infection you stayed where you was at. When the non-infection test showed to the individual the goal of CDCR was to fill the bunks again in the regular housing.</br></br>I was one that did not test positive for COVID-19. The people that did was put right back where I was at. Since my Pfizer vaccine in February they completely stopped testing me. So the testing is a current failure and the vaccination housing of inmates is non-existent in CDCR.</br></br>It took the state awhile to realize how serious the Federal Government was going to take the pandemic. Now once the prison has community support and COVID-19 as an excuse continue programs have to be well advised before given the control. I am a murderer. I billed one person with a .38 revolver. Police reform begins with conviction.</br></br>My case has to show less forgiveness for the convictions to begin properly with the police! The murderer has to be written to prove fear, prove education, and even me to prove record! I am in a place for murderer to find a heart and plea for forgiveness. But guess what I believe in reform and education my call would show me un-educated in murder and lean to voluntary manslaughter.</br></br>Once a police officer is fingered out as the educated the conviction will stick. Remember I will share my stories just ask away and remember correspondence needs small financial peace and support. I have been in prison since 118 days after September 2001. I waived my appeal and for one murder I carry three life sentence. I have been violent in here.</br></br>I have a staff assault, they knocked my teeth out. They are smart at what they do until the witness happens to an individual. I am mentally ill from meth abuse. I donâ€™t believe in conspiracies. I rather believe in abuse. God is powerful and suicide is easy. So remember this when you ask because I will try to answer for my God in heaven when it is all said and done.</br></br>
