This story was told by a person incarcerated at Soledad.</br> </br>UCI: What is the current COVID situation at your facility? Is everything going okay, or?</br></br>

Caller: Okay, so when we first started, we were one of the prisons that there were no cases. What they did is they did a prison raid here, and they brought in a special agency outside of the prison.</br></br> 

And those guys contaminated the prison. From that point on, the maximum amount of cases we had was 168. We currently have only about 32 active cases.</br></br>

We have a couple of wings that are quarantined because if they - if one person gets it, what they do is take that person and put them into quar- I mean in the - they have a wing that they use just for COVID dudes, and then they have a wing that they quarantine you if they don't know if you got it. Like, you know, the incubation period.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: And then there's two wings down right now that are considered quarantine. And there's one building that they use for quarantine.</br></br> 

So they really have three buildings for quarantine and one for active cases. They use the gym for that. It's only 32 guys in there.</br></br>

The biggest experience is this: before COVID, the average inmate was out of his cell probably about 16 hours a day. So from 6:00 a.m. till 9:00 at night, he was out of his cell. Now he's in his cell all day.</br></br>

He comes out for showers every 72 hours. He only gets three to five hours of yard a week. So we're in our cell 160 hours a week.</br></br>

UCI: That’s definitely a drastic change.</br></br>

Caller: They only give us one roll of toilet paper, one bar of soap. If you can’t go to canteen, or anything like that, you're pretty much on your own if you can't get a package. They did allow us to get an extra COVID-19 package, but you have to pay for it. It's not like they gave it to you.</br></br>

Everything in here we have to buy, even though the tax man pays or the taxpayer pays billions of dollars for prisons. We buy our televisions, we buy our clothes. The only thing they give us is three small meals a day, power to the cell, and water in the cell. Everything else we have to - our families support us.</br></br>

So our families are sending, on average, for a guy that has support from $50 to $200 a month for canteen, and then they're sending packages every 90 days that cost anywhere from $100 to $300.</br></br>

We have television, but we only get like a couple of channels. There's no - we are, we don't have access to media like you would have like you have a Direct TV package, and you've got like 30, 40 channels, we don't have that. They've got the basic channels, ABC, NBC, CW.</br></br>

There is no library where you can go to. There's no dining room where they're allowing us to go to that. So before the COVID, you can go to that. There's no dining room activity.</br></br> 

There's no library activity. There's no education. There's no vocation. There's no rehabilitation classes being given at all.</br></br>

They are giving like handouts, everything's handouts, and the groups that are more powerful, they started doing Zoom stuff where they record it, and they played on the system.
