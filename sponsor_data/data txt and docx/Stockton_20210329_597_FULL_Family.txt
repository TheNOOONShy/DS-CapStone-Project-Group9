This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Stockton.</br></br>

Hi. Thank you for taking the time to write. You ask if we have stories to tell, well, not so much, just visits. Not having visits has taken a toll on our relationship with our family.</br></br>

As for myself, I lost an uncle to the coronavirus. He was 60 years old and work in a prison as a CO. It hurt me not to be able to attend his funeral. Not only do I feel for my lost, I feel the pain of everybody’s losses.</br></br>

I will get out soon and I hope things are back to normal, but must all be safe and wear a mask. I really don’t have much to say, so I will end this letter by saying take care.
