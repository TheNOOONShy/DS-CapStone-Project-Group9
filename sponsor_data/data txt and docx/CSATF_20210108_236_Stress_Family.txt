Now as far as my experience goes behind walls under the COVID-19 pandemic? Let’s just say I’m used to the mistreatment, the unsanitary, and etc. Been going through it for six years now. The world is just finally getting a chance to walk in our shoes in other words get a dose of our medicine. To be honest, the only hard part for me is no visits or phone calls due to the fact that I’ve lost my girlfriend, my father, along with other friends and family members since my incarceration.<br/><br/>

So I get very worried a lot and deal with anxiety on a daily basis. But, besides that, I’ve learned to cope, so no complaints. Now if I hadn’t learned to cope oh bets believe I can go on and on and on how jacked up present is. In fact I’m working on a prison TV script called “Hebrews 13.3” which means in biblical scripture “remember those in prison as though you were in prison with them.” It’s based on inside prison fact, so keep an eye out on me. You might see me on TV one day. I am extremely multitalented.
