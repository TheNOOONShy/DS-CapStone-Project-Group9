Theme: Stress: Contacting family

Phone Access</br></br>

The main method of communication between the inmate and his family is the phone. As soon as the virus officially entered this prison, all be it, on a separate and unconnected yard. Staff took the correct and expedient of stopping all contact visits. This left US mail and GlobalTel [expensive collect call system] as the only two sources for an inmate to be in contact with his family.</br></br>
We all know the problems and delays with the US mail even before COVID, and now you quadruple that with "staff shortages" within the prison because of infections amongst staff, real or feigned, (*they get paid whether they are here or not).</br></br>

So now we get to phones. If one is in prison, his relationship is already stressed and strained, and now I'll describe a [15-minute phone call]. First, as a result of cost cutting, and CTF being an old prison, the phones, 18 of them in a row, for 1,200 inmates, are located outside with no awning or protection from the weather. If it is 40 degrees and raining, and if you want your call, you are going to stand in line for an hour or two to make your call.</br></br>
Why an hour or two? Do the math [18 phones] [15 minutes each] [1200 inmates] even though all 1200 inmates are never on the yard together, the revolving phone line is. So, 72 inmates per hour is the rate on the phone. Now if there are 600 inmates on the yard, and only half [300] want to use t}re phone, then you may stand in line 3-4 hours to make your 15 minutes collect call, in the rain in the cold, if there is no unexpected early yard recall.</br></br>
And right now, because of the restrictions placed on us due to the unpreparedness of the prison, we are only getting a shot at yard where the phones are every 3-4 days and only for an hour or two at a time. Now you have people cutting and bullying their way into line,....[wow prison is just like free society].</br></br>
