You owe me so much that I could cry right now. Your abuse of power has hurt me and costed me eight years of my life. I wasn’t even allowed to shit because of you. You were a tyrant and a Nazi.</br></br> 

I worked the program perfectly, I deserve to have my charges dropped. One DA used those same charges to convict me and give me a nine-year sentence. You’re brilliant and beautiful on?</br></br> 

You win. I lose. My trial. Prejudice dated and discrimination [unintelligible]. Idk. But I don’t think that those charges were legal to use against me in court. I think they were illegal evidence.</br></br>

Those charges as well as my college grades he should never of had access to. What’s the premise when you give someone the WIT program? Ad hominem and prejudice I could use right now.</br></br> 

I’m just trapped here how can I get [unintelligible], a hopeless waste. In the name of sport I have been killed.</br></br> 

What are you doing to me? What am I to you? What is this slap happy work feet?</br></br> 

I was trying to give my testimony, but the DA interjected and cut me off using those same charges and even my school grade. And I was asked an open-ended question, “what happened,” and then before I finished, “No further question your honor.”</br></br> 

The people think I’m German and Japanese so they’re trying to lock me up for life (Axis). My life might be in danger but the sheriffs and cops are fraudulence. I’m just coming to grips with my race. People want me dead for being German and Jap. (Axis).</br></br> 

By this day and age we should be beyond prejudice, but we aren’t, not at all. I feel like my life is in danger because of my race. It might have something to do with trying to start World War Three. Am I the cause of the virus being here?</br></br> 

Prejudice is the reason for the virus being here. If they locked me up prematurely. I fought back the only way I could. I deserve freedom.</br></br>

If you look into my trial you’ll see how things went and I.
