To whom it may concern
        First off I hope that this letter reaches you in the best of health & spirits...when I got your letter I was a bunch of mixed emotions & questions confused, curious, delighted… one of my 1st thoughts were who from UC Irvine is writing me? How did they get my info? & cool I gotta penpal… TBH I’ve been kinda going through a little rough patch in serving this time & even tho it wasn't the kind of letter I was expecting it still made my day… Well I do have interesting story for you regarding this pandemic so let me get started on that… For me it’s been very nerve racking & stressful during this pandemic we went from having visits on a normal basis, yard daily, & religious services to a whole different dynamic. At 1st I was only allowed one phone call a month due to my program group so seeing the news and all the tragic headlines & not being able to call was stressfull… when the pandemic 1st hit we were slammed no dayroom, phone calls yet we were still allowed to go to yard... 
So this was the daily program for a bit then a correctional officer in my building had COVID & too tell you the truth it’s not all that bad… About a day or 2 after his return one of the porters who works closely with that particular C.O got real sick… It turned out he caught COVID before he actually knew it he was still doing his job as a porter… The porters clean the building, pass out breakfast; lunches, & dinner. There are 2 sets of porters, a set of 3 porters in the morning & a set of 4 porters at night… This particular porter worked in the morning, when they confirmed he had COVID they moved him to building 8… They had made building 8 the designated building for those infected with covid for quarantine, so if you tested positive you were supposed to be moved to 8 block… 
The problem with that was once people started refusing to be moved they left them in the same building they were housed but CTQ’ed them (confined to cell/isolation)... Now since the porter was still working they decided to test the whole building once they moved him to 8 block… So while we were awaiting the test, we had no movement the only people who had movement were the porters… the same 2 remaining porters from the morning shift who worked with the infected porter & @ night the same 3 porters as usual… Once the building was completed testing they relaxed a bit & started giving us a little program we were able to get on the phone, had yard & 100 people to the dayroom while we were still awaiting the test results… This is in the beginning of the pandemic so no rapid test results took a week or 2 & we where afforded these programs not knowing who was positive or negative… A week went by & slowly the staff were placing people on Isolation in their cells because they tested positive… Lucky for me I wasnt one of those people but in my section of the building there were 13 people who were positive…. 
The building is broken up into 3 sections [redacted], [redacted], [redacted], [redacted] & [redacted] holds 20 cells & Charlie holds 22 cells …. The maximum occupance of the building holds 124 inmates max but some cells are only occupied by one inmate…. Theres 5 cells on the bottom right and five cells above 4 cells have the same vents & its the exact same design on the left of each section…. Theres 2 showers per section a dayroom & 1 phone which we all share…. So in my section @ least 9 cells were infected and the coworkers of the porter were both positive…. And remember they were the only ones with movement while the building was waiting to be tested…So we were able to go to yard & mingle there was 3 times I know for sure that people who were positive slipped out to yard with us. 
I forgot to mention we where given face masks (were). Overall we were exposed to inadequate sanitation methods were not given disinfectant on a daily, gloves, proper PPE vent poor isolation of exposed and infected inmates being that we still had to share the phone showers & ventilation systems with them…. They were allowed to use the phone in regular rotation @ least once a week…. 
The worse part besides not knowing how my family was doing during this time was when my cellmate woke up without his sense of smell & taste… We both had tested negative 2wice prior to this and one night he caught a headache he thought nothing of it took some medication & tried to sleep it off… The next morning he overslept until about 12 noon & went to brush his teeth & couldnt smell or taste the toothpaste…. He began trying to smell everything with a sent in the cell & came up with the same results no smell…. He had to wait approximently 6hrs to notify the nurse of his symptoms & when he did they took tempeture, oxygen, & blood pressure his temp was in the slight fever area they gave him some tylenol type pills & sent him back in the cell….
A week went by & no follow up or anything out-side the daily tempeture checks they were doing for everyone…. So i told him to tell the nurse again he did they did the same thing as the first time they sent him back to the cell placed 2 Isolation tags on our doors…. 2 days later they tested both of us he asked can he go to the hospital or get moved to 8 block because its clear he has it & why get me infected as well Their response was well since you both share a cell 9/10 he’s caught it as well & we dont wanna risk moving you to another building & you infecting that building so if hes not positive this time he can be moved or he can sign a waiver saying he’d like to be remain in the cell & were not responsible My test came up negative & I moved out but they never this crisis seriously in my opinion…. And still arent so theres a little information on how this has effected me mentally it’s hard enough being locked up but not knowing if youll survive under these circumstances are hard or knowing whats going on with your family so yeah it was & still pretty hard….
I do have a regret or 2 as well, I know that I am considered a criminal in the eyes of many in the world because Im locked up & that may turn some people off but I would like to see if any of the females would like be a pen pal & even the guys alike but I’d prefer a female…. I also would like to see if I could find some assistance in helping me with research/legal matters?.... Growing up I made some poor choices lyke joining a gang, smoking, drinking, quiting sports & ended up serving time for some of the acts that along with that lifestyle… On this case I did not commit the crime I took a plea for I did on the other hand possess a gun I only took the plea to avoid a life sentence & was taken advantage of with the plea…. My counsel did not truely investigate what I told him and basically trucked me off… on the day I was to pick my jury he told me that he had no defense, he wasnt gonna call any of my witnesses & said I was stupid & should take the plea…. I tried to fire him & get new counsel but the judge denied me that right so I took the plea to have some chance @ coming home to my kids someday… since my sentencing in 2014 I’ve been studying the law & Ive found out my sentence is unauthorized I have tried to get my sentenced modified twice but have been denied even though my facts are correct…. 
I was sentenced to 26 years for a crime I didnt committ, I admit to what I did do which is have a gun thats due to the lifestyle I was living then but I didnt do what Im charged with which is [redacted] years, [redacted], & [redacted] years [redacted]; & [redacted] years. Theres video footage that can place me somewhere else when the crime occured but my public defender failed to investigate… & @ the time of my sentence I was in violation of People vs [redacted] ([redacted]) [redacted]; [redacted], & the year after my sentencing People vs [redacted] says my sentence is in violation. My lawyer wants 16,000 for a Habeas Corpus I dont have that kind of money so I was hoping that I can get someone to help me start a gofundme for my legal fees...yeah I’ve done wrong in my life but Im only doing this time because I have no $ to fight & even though I have family they are all living their lives Im a distant memory… I’ve changed a lot over the years & I just want to be there for my children so if you guys could help me with these 2 things I’ll forever be in your debt thank you for your time


Sincerly
