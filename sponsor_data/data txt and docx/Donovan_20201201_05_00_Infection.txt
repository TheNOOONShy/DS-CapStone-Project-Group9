This story was told by a person incarcerated at Donovan.</br></br>

Caller: Facility E - at Facility E, here, in R.J.D, we haven't actually had no outbreaks whatsoever at all. So the testing that they're doing for their officers and staff, actually, I guess, is working. And we haven't had no outbreaks. And that's been the positive thing about the yard here.</br></br>UCI: Absolutely. How often would they say that - do you know how often they're testing staff?</br></br>Caller: Well, they were doing it every two weeks. However, a new memo came out. And it said that they're going to be testing every week now.
