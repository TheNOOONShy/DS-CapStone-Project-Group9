Meanwhile, I've been sick for a week, and I had to go what they call man down. So, there's a clinic, there's an emergency. And the only way to get to the emergency is if you do- you call- it's a command it’s to the guards “I'm going man down. I'm sick as hell and I'm going to fall down on the floor. So take me immediately to emergency.”</br></br>

So they did, and I was suffering from the worst nausea I've ever had in my life, chills, aches, pains, but no congestion and no fever. That's the weird thing. No taste, the loss of taste, loss of smell.</br></br>

Everything tasted like gasoline- would smell. I mean, I couldn't even drink cold water. Fatigue, couldn't eat, I lost probably 12, 15 pounds, which is probably a good thing.</br></br>

It's a hell of a way to lose weight. But I'm telling you, I did. And so they they took us out of our housing unit and split up all the cellies, they put us in different cells.</br></br>

And I was 17 days- they put us in a place called South block in badger section, B section, which is badger section, which they usually use for reception: guys coming out of jail, sit in these cells until they're classified to go to their final destination to do their time. So it's transient, and nobody cleans it. And there's white supremacist graffiti all over the walls and swastikas and the thing’s dirty and the mattresses are nasty, and they weren't giving us any soap or towels or anything for a few days.</br></br>

And we were getting food but it was brought on trays from the chow hall that was cold. And finally the- all the inmates get locked down, so there's nobody to cook the food because the free staff is not going to do it. And then the free staff fell to COVID, so they couldn't come in.</br></br>

So then it's the guards that have to do it- mind that at one point we were getting three three bag lunches a day, which is either state bologna and bread and an apple. Well apple’s good, but- and water from the- I mean, that's basically what it is three times- or peanut butter. So it's food, and you're getting calories, but there's like no vegetables, there's no there's no meats, there's no I mean, you don't want eat to bologna and- no, this is bad stuff.</br></br>

We don't know what's in it. Peanut butter isn’t bad, you know, for that kind of stuff. But you get enough of it, and eat three times a day or whatever and, and you're in the cell by yourself on the bunk, boom, because the cells are tiny.</br></br>
