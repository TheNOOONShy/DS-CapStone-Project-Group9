I've only been in prison for a year now, this whole time dealing with COVID-19 in here as well. As in the real world, I've lost my grandparents both in the same month due to COVID-19, as other family members fight COVID.</br></br>

The conditions in here are horrible at times. A few I can name are canteen/packages, both have not been consistent. We go months without going to canteen/packages, no yard due to quarantine. I understand this is not to spread but we have different C/Os working our building every other day. If we are to get this virus it will be from them as they are the ones who go from building to building.</br></br>

Family visits are not being ran. We are able to get a video visit every 30 days which is not enough! Administration takes too much money when family adds to your trust account. I could keep going but like I said just to name a few.
