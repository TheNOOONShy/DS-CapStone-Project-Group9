This story was told by a person incarcerated at Salinas Valley.</br></br>


UCI: Okay, thank you for telling me that. How has the vaccination situation been like at the facility since they’ve been vaccinating now?</br></br>


Caller: Well, they’ve been coming through. They’re offering everybody a vaccination. I, I refuse to take it. I didn’t wanna take it because of the way it was being done. They was doing it, they was doing it around everyone, and then, at the same time the next day, you got staff coming in without their masks on their face, but they on their chin, so I’m like, “No, I’m not taking that.” Why, what for? You know, take it. Then, you end up with COVID after-the-fact? No, I’m not doing it.</br></br> 


UCI: Mm.</br></br> 


Caller: Yeah, yeah.</br></br>


UCI: Understandable, I respect that. I’m sorry, go ahead.</br></br>


Caller: What did you say?</br></br>


UCI: I said I respect that. I was going to ask you how, well, like, how has it, like, affected your loved ones?</br></br>


Caller: Oh, well, my daughter’s had it. You mean, affect them as far as them having COVID?</br></br>


UCI: Yes, or just the situation at your facility in general.</br></br>


Caller: Oh, they worry about my situation. They know that, with me being, you know, older and having breathing issues and stuff, they know there’s a chance I can get it and not even make it out the system.</br></br>


UCI: Hm.</br></br>


Caller: Yeah, yeah, so they’re worried about it. And, you know, they claim that they let people out based on COVID but my, you know, my case is nonviolent. Nonviolent, no victims, just me on the violations, but still, no. They don’t let me out at all. They leave me here.</br></br>


UCI: Mhm. So, how have you been coping with that?</br></br>


Caller: You know what, it’s very frustrating and upsetting because they’re supposed to went around to all the institutions. Anybody 60, close to 60 and they having issues, health issues, underlying health issues -- they’re supposed to look at that and let them go home, but they don’t do it at all. That’s the one thing they tell the media, but it’s not the truth, you know?</br></br>


UCI: Mm.</br></br>


Caller: It’s not the truth, you know. If we had millions and millions of dollars, yes. But since we don’t have millions and millions of dollars, then that’s what they gonna lie and say that this is what they, this is what they doing when they not actually doing it. You know, if my name was Weinstein, somebody with dollars, then okay. Talk about being in a halfway house, I’d be in my house somewhere under house arrest or whatever it may be, you know? The CDCR, they lie to everybody. They don’t follow the rules. The union, the union don’t want things right; they want issues and problems, you know?</br></br>


UCI: Mhm.</br></br>


Caller: Because it makes them look better.
