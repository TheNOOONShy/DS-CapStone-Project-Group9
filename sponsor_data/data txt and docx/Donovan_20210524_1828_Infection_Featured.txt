My story starts in early February 2020 before COVID was well known at all. At that time everyone in her, staff and inmates were coming down with what we thought was a particularly strong strain of the flu. I heard some many people complaining of extreme exhaustion and body aches, fevers and chills and trouble breathing.</br></br> I thought it was being pumped up until I got it. I hardly ever get sick but I have never been so horribly sick in my life with this. On the fourth day, I woke up in the middle of the night and I couldn’t get a breath. I sat there in the dark, terrified, gasping for air. I truly thought I might die.</br></br> Now it was never confirmed that it was COVID-19 that swept the prison because hardly anyone had even heard of COVID at that time. But all of us who got sick were all in agreement that we had COVID-19.</br></br> Shortly after that the pandemic took off and for safety reasons they shut the prison down. There were no visits, no groups, no education, no one went to work except the “critical workers” that life in here can’t run without. Each building on the yard was its own isolated island and for the 11 months we all were confined to our cells where we were allowed to shower and use the phone every other day, one cell at a time and that’s it.</br></br>  I was one of the lucky few “critical workers” because I work in the AM kitchen. Normally we had a crew of about 25 people working to feed 800 inmates. When corona hit our crew was cut to eight people and we were expected to work from 4 am to 11:30 am seven days a week so we did. It was not easy but we did it until late November.</br></br>When one of the free staff kitchen supervisors came to work while positive for COVID and gave it to us workers where it then hit the yard and spread like wildfire. They quarantined all us kitchen workers along with our entire building. It was unfair how they just tossed us workers to the side when we had worked so hard all year long but we all had COVID so we understood.
