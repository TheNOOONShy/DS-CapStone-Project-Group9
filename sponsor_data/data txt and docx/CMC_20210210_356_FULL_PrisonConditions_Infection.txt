Hi
<br/><br/>


Thanks for the letter of concern. How even you got to me is a wonder. 
<br/><br/>


I have been in the thick of things at this prison concerning COVID-19 I was housed in a 65 man dorm at one time, and once we saw the response of the administration here, our dorm shut down. We refuse to provide COVID-19 test to the medical staff because we was concern for our safety. 
<br/><br/>


We was having discussion with the facility captains. The head of the medical staff, Doctor [Redacted] and it was all double talk. Our protest was based on being moved to other locations in the prison, the administration was moving inmates all over the place. Positive with negatives.
<br/><br/>


Resolved with T&T, it just got bad. A secret feud was going on between the officers and medical staff. We had no medical treatment unless you fail out, then you get medical treatment, all the other medical we was dealing with in our lives was put on hold.
<br/><br/>


All my life I never been afraid of nothing. I knew some guys that’s badder than COVID-19 and I wasn’t afraid them. But this COVID-19 thing put fear in some rough dudes at these prisons. They treat us bad.
<br/><br/>


If you got a positive test, the solution (drink more water) I don’t feel safe. And COVID-19 is coming back, it ain’t over. I can’t put all the violations that took place during this pandemic, reduced visits. No visits. Mail is slow. You constantly being moved around. 
<br/><br/>


Their motto was let’s get everyone infected so we can get the program back up & going. They was falling behind on the contract fulfillments. The handling of this pandemic was disrespectful toward human life.
<br/><br/>


I lost two friends in the matter of 24 hours. Dead. Due to lack of medical treatment, response time, and the officers panicking on what to do. Because he don’t want to get sued.
<br/><br/>


Yes they have offered the vaccine. I refused it because I don’t have enough information on it. Family bonds has been ruined, lives has been lost. 
<br/><br/>


Social distancing was just words, cleaning supplies very limited, one roll of toilet paper. Hey I even wrote a writ to the courts. Here in San Luis Obispo never heard anything back.
<br/><br/>


I kept notes on how I was affected, my mind, my body, my hopes, and I’m still not 100%. Well let me go for now. If you want to go into details on more let me know, a copy of something. 
<br/><br/>


I been in the thick of it. Complaining to the administration, to medical, the guards blame it on medical, and medical have excuses. They a committee made of staff & medical directors and it’s called ICP led by a Doctor [redacted]. That man has no clue to have this go and how he fail us. If your project is sincere you can get stories and info.
