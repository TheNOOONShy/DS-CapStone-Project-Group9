This story was told by a person incarcerated at Solano.</br></br>

Caller: There is one porter assigned to building nine that resides on delta facility. He is housed in building 19. He was trained by HSM, the part of the medical wing that does the cleaning of infectious waste and hazardous material. On some occasions, by the time that person arrives, some of the vacated cells from those who tested positive or were moved to the gym are not cleaned according to standard. In three separate instances, volunteer porters had to notify building staff that the cells needed to be sprayed just as incoming residents were physically moving their property in.</br></br> 

The fact that someone housed on the lower level, general population, is escorted to the buildings for clean up, then go back every day puts at risk the safety and security of the institution through possible transmission. Clearly, medical is overwhelmed by the influx of COVID that has made its way into the prison's otherwise sterile environment through its staff. For follow-up questions, you can call this prison and ask for extension 5336 to talk to a medical health director. There you go, that's it.
