This story was told by a person incarcerated at Delano.</br></br>

Caller: And I’m just - I'm stuck here you know I mean there’s no visits, there’s no family. I mean, it’s like if you don’t have someone send you a book, people are just locked up in here. I mean, and they’ve had about 1,200 people here that have had COVID, I think they’ve only had five deaths. But I’m telling you we were in a building, the only building in the prison with C-1 A and B.</br></br> 

And they had a big outbreak in C-3, they locked them down for 14 days, they took the people who were sick and they put them into our dorm. They didn’t test them again, they didn’t give them any medication, they brought these people who were still sick and it’s like “wow” you know? And I know that everybody’s being affected by this, you know, so I know it’s not just people in here suffering but you know this is, you know somebody is making a whole bunch of money off of this. That’s for sure, you know, and it ain’t us.</br></br>

UCI: Just to clarify, they took a bunch of people who were already infected with COVID and then they placed them with people who didn’t have COVID?</br></br>

Caller: Yes, they did.</br></br> 

UCI: Oh.</br></br>

Caller: This was on C-1. C-3 had the outbreak and I believe the outbreak was like the first week of January. They took everybody out of these buildings and they locked them down to cells and they quarantined them 'cause it was like a dorm setting. They locked them in the cells, they kept the guys who did not have COVID for 19 days.</br></br> 

The guys who had COVID, they took them out after 14 days, they never tested them again and they put them into the only building in the whole prison that didn’t have some type of COVID outbreak.</br></br>

UCI: Mmhmm.

Caller: You know, so-</br></br>

UCI: And-</br></br>

Caller: You know.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah.
