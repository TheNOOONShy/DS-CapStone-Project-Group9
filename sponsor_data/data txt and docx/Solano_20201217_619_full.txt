This story was told by a person incarcerated at Solano.</br></br>

Caller: Ah yes, how are you doing?</br></br>

UCI: I'm good. How are you?</br></br>

Caller: Oh well. Hey, everybody's going through it right now and we just definitely need some help. Definitely need some. There's no medical staff, there's no outside people saying what's going on.</br></br> 

They wait till 7:00, 8:00 in the evening to start moving people that say they're positive, to say they're negative. But they are not giving them no receipts, no documents. We don't know where these other people are coming from, and they moving us into this gym that's not clean or sterilized.</br></br>

No mattresses. I mean, it's just simple. No hot meals, no nothing. And there's no, all my tests have come back negative. So why have I been moving to three or four different places? I haven't got any symptoms yet or anything that I was positive or anything.</br></br> 

And the same with other people. The medical doctors and nurses say, "You're negative." But then when the lights go out, or the shift changes, the sergeant or another officer comes in and says, "You're positive, you're going over here." I mean, where's the evidence, or the slip, or the receipt?</br></br>

You know, I mean, in these couple of months and I think the gym is over the capacity. And the judge sentenced the gym down saying it was unsafe, unsanitary, and unclean. And now he doubled into something double with the capacity. "I see you're not taking care of the medical issues. What's going on in here?"</br></br>

I mean, the tension is actually rising as we speak right now. And it's hard. Now, we really need some type of board to assist us through this process because it's really having a strain on people's patience and everybody. It's just out of control.</br></br>

UCI: So sorry to interrupt you. Please continue with anything you'd like to share.</br></br>

Caller: We are definitely being used as guinea pigs here at Solano State Prison. They did not present any document that says you're negative or positive. They are just moving you around with people that are positive, people that are negative, people with attitudes.</br></br> 

We have to clean the bars, the cells, our cells, the rooms, the bed, and everything ourselves. And it's not enough materials that would be provided so we can protect ourselves. They are more concerned about sweeping the floor than they are about disinfecting the whole place.</br></br>

Giving us a change of clothes, giving us hot meals, or anything. They're just moving people around. And without any medical personnel coming in here telling us, "This is what's needed. This is your test results."</br></br>

So, the shift change, and then a different officer come in and do things their way and they're creating a hostile environment. We're not being actually attended to. They're denying us our due process and denying us our equal protection. They're denying us our right to life.</br></br>

They are not providing anything medical. That should be done in preparation to help us try to deal with this pandemic. People are already stressing that they can't see their family. They don't know if they'd ever see their family again.</br></br>

We definitely need to speak to the warden and the chief and medical staff. We definitely need to speak to somebody that would listen to us and to hear what we're saying. They want us to cooperate with them, we trying to cooperate peacefully and humbly and communicate.</br></br> 

But they just say, "Hey, pack your stuff. You're going over here. So and so says you're positive. All right, you're going to the hole. Well, we're going to lock you up." or "We're going to take this from you." Come on. They're just force feeding us these cold meals and stuff like that.</br></br> 

It's just unsanitary and unhealthy and it's not helping our appetite at all. I'm not going to sit here and eat all this cold stuff and bring it over you. Are you kidding me? Breakfast, lunch, and dinner is just terrible, you know. It's bad It's just really bad. We need some help.</br></br>

UCI: Okay, so, I have a few questions to ask you. Has the handling of COVID-19 changed since the outbreak first started in March, like it is being handled worse now, is it better than it was before?</br></br>

Caller: It's worse. Everything was worse because these people staff, and medical staff are using us as a guinea pig, they're are getting paid while they go through a training process. They're just now learning how to deal with such a pandemic or any type of high level medical situation.</br></br>

A lot of the tasks and they don't know what's going on, they don't know they just don't want to lose their job, or the physician is taking orders for somebody that just guessing. There's no plan, there's no documentation.</br></br>

We haven't been provided to show us the A to Z what's going on and what's happening. They're just coming up with different rules and different methods. Either you can tell that they're not trained, they're not experienced.</br></br>

They never had no training or no experience to this magnitude before and they don't know what they're doing. A lot haven't been in the system for that long. They just came from Walmart or out in the fields or a hardware store or something like that.</br></br>

They didn't go to Harvard, or Princeton, or Berkeley, or nothing like that. They just came hanging and got a job, cuz they don't have a felony. And now they don't know how to deal with it. And then then inmates that's been in here, like myself, I've been going for 40 years. I didn't come here to die.</br></br>

I'm not here for death. I know I have a right to life. I know I have a right to equal protection. I know I have a right to my due process. And I have a right to be heard and speak. You know, and this is what everybody needs.</br></br>

These guys did lose their cool. Somebody just starts coughing or throwing up and all of a sudden everybody it's now ready to go at each other. And so, you know, we don't want no viruses, and nobody to get hurt or anything like that.</br></br>

We just need somebody to show us and tell us as a professional, or at least a warden, or a chief medical doctor, or nurse, or doctor, or somebody. Not just any guy that came here at 2 o'clock to say, "Well, they said you're positive, so you're moving." I mean, come on, man. Give me a medical slip.</br></br>

I got seven slips that says I'm negative. All negative. No, no, no signs, no nothing. And then he comes this officer and says, "Oh, you're going to the gym because you're positive." "What do you mean I'm positive?" "Your name came up." "What do you mean? All of my slips were showing negative."</br></br> 

It's just, I don't know what they're doing. They just seem like they're using us as experimental guinea pigs you know through a process until they can figure out how to do better than they are doing, you know. It's just terrible.</br></br>

UCI: So, if you test positive do they help you out in any way? For example, if you have symptoms, do they help you with any medications? Or do they just move you and then that's it?</br></br>

Caller: That's it. They come in and take our temperature every day, twice a day or something like that, you know. And come on, you know, temperature and our blood pressure, you know. And if one minute is hot in here, next minute is cold in here. One minute I have a jacket on and then the next minute I got a shirt on.</br></br> 

It's just the water in the shower is cold, you know. There's no hot water in the sink except for one little sink they have in here. It's just bad. They're just doing the basic, basic little old stuff, you know. They're not doing anything.</br></br>

UCI: So sorry to hear about that. I'd like to ask you a few more questions. How have you been, how have you or your family members been coping with the crisis? So, for example, how have you been coping being inside?</br></br>

Caller: I haven't been. I'm from down south. And I haven't seen my parents. They are under a medical care, and they talk about phase one. You can get one visit for an hour, but one person. How's that gonna happen? I'm in a hardship situation.</br></br>

My elderly parents can't come up here one at a time an hour. They're not gonna stay outside for 30 minutes, and then six feet away. It's not going to happen. I need to be closest to my family or I need to be released, you know.</br></br> 

So, they're not gonna take care of me and just open up the door or something so I can take care of myself, so I can get what I need. If I need some help. They're not giving me any documentation about how I can cope with my situation.</br></br>

"Well, you're positive, here's your receipt, and you need to change your diet, you need to do this, you need to do this, this is how we determined that you were positive because of such and such and such." But they're not giving me anything. All my papers are saying negative. Zero percent.</br></br> 

Negative, negative, negative, negative. And then they come off and tell me I'm positive and put me up here with people that probably are positive. I mean, that's right there way it's the symptoms that I haven't had. I have come up with some COVID feels.</br></br>

So, I won't get an attitude, so I won't develop any other symptoms you know from this because my body and my emotions can't just adjust that quick to all of these quick changes, three different times from the forefront this month into filthy places.</br></br>

UCI: How has it been to try and cope without visitation or having any type of programming available?</br></br>

Caller: It's hard because my parents ask questions. Other family members ask questions and then to tell them that they say I'm positive. My mom is, "What do you mean baby? All your slips are saying negative. Why would they say that you're positive and put you over here with these people?"</br></br> 

I have my hands in the air. I don't know. I'm trying to find out what's going on, what's happening. So, now my family is worried. They're going through it.</br></br> 

I'm already worried about my elderly parents because my nieces and nephews are running in and out the house not wearing proper PPE or anything like that. They might bring this stuff in from the streets from this or that and the other. So, there's a lot going on with the stress and the worry.</br></br>

UCI: What do you, what would you like to see your facility do to make the situation better for you guys?</br></br>

Caller: Well, we would like to have some type of chief medical officer qualified, a medical person and a warden that let us know the policies and procedures that we're going through in this process. You know. What does it consist of?</br></br>

Is this just random moving and switching and stuff or is it a trend that we can see from a printout, you know, or something. We're not saying we're weird but it's just that they're guessing and assuming you know what's going on or figuring out well I think this might work best. Come on, now.</br></br>

This is people's lives at stake here. They're not taking it seriously at all. So, where's the work that they've been working with. We can sit down and have discussions with, or something like this, you know. Facilitating classes in a certain amount of yard over the weekend.</br></br> 

Ask questions to the warden and the chief medical staff, or something like this in a town hall type forum or something where we can get somebody saying to get some more questions asked from people with the proper authority, you know, talking to regular people. And not just taking blood pressure, they're just hoping to opening doors and closing doors and tell us to go in your cells.</br></br>

UCI: Is there anything else that you would like to share before the call ends?</br></br>

Caller: Well, we could need some help and I'm just hoping that we get some help. And I can't continue the conversation in because those 60 seconds they're going to shut us off in less than that. I appreciate you allowing me to vent. And I hope to have some thoughts on this where we can get some help with feedback.</br></br>

And I'll keep you posted if I can. If new developments come through or chief medical staff, or a warden comes through and gives us something to work with, giving us an indication of hope, or something, instead of just shuffling this around like we're just a bunch of experimental guinea pigs.</br></br>

UCI: Right.
