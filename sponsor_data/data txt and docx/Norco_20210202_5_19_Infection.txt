This story was told by a person incarcerated at Norco.</br></br>Caller: So okay, so I personally tested positive back in September.</br></br>UCI: Mhm.</br></br>Caller: And one of the big things that they’re telling us to do is social distance and it’s impossible to do. I mean I’m in a, just so you know, I’m in a- this is a dorm setting, this is not cells. So this a dorm setting and as a matter of fact, my dorm right now is on quarantine.</br></br>We’ve had, in the last two weeks, we’ve had probably about 25-30 people test positive. And like I said, one of my friends who tested positive I think in August, tested positive again on Monday.</br></br>
They have started in my dorm, they’ve given about maybe 10 people the vaccine, the first shot. But a couple of those people have tested positive since then. You know and it's just, it’s- for a lot of us, it's just really scary cause I mean well like I’m saying one of the main things we’re being told to do is social distance and I mean it's all over the news but we can’t- it’s impossible to do that.</br></br>
And you know me, personally, I like I said I tested positive back in September, and you know God with all these new variants, I definitely don’t wanna, I'm praying I don’t test positive again. And I’m eerie from all the health experts is that we can have long-term effects. I mean like I had symp- I was sick, really sick for two days.</br></br>UCI: Mhm.</br></br>Caller: And I had symptoms. I felt bad a little bit after that, but I was really really sick for two days.
