This story was told by a person incarcerated at Chuckawalla.</br></br>
Caller: Yeah, it was not. I mean, I'm fine now.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br> 
Caller: But I just couldn't believe it.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: Believe how they were handling it. One thing I will say when I got to D-11 they do two checks per day. And they bring a force of like I don't know I didn't really count. I think it's like nine or ten nurses in and they're taking your - that was really good.</br></br>
I thought that that was very important but again you're getting more medical attention when you're in D-11 than you are in central health. Which is supposed to be the trauma center for the prison.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>
Caller: And not only that you could move around better in D-11 than you can in central health. I just think that they need to change that whole thing when you're in central health. They're saying they're monitoring you but there's no difference between you being in D-11 or central health, except it feels like more of a punishment.</br></br>
UCI: Yeah. So, what would make the situation at your facility better?</br></br>
Caller: I'm sorry.</br></br>
UCI: What would make the situation at your facility better?</br></br>
Caller: They really need to have, I think they need to have some experts from the street, real medical professionals from the street.</br></br>  

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br> 

Caller: Not CDCR medical professionals come in and assess the situation. Because moving people around when you have COVID, a very deadly disease it is no joke.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah. Mm-hmm.</br></br>
Caller: I don't know if you've had it or you've known somebody that's had it but, but it almost got me. And I exercise every day, I'm healthy.</br></br> 

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, of course I have a bad history of using drugs in the past, but it's been ten years. And it's still, I never thought in a million years it would get me.</br></br> 

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br> 

Caller: And I really didn't think it would.</br></br> 

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: But it, it's something that I don't think a lot of people including here, because we're in a remote, rural area they're not taking it super serious.</br></br> 

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: Even with the, the deaths. It's preventative. I think a lot of things could be preventative. Meaning that the medical staff, they need more staff.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br> 

Caller: They need more medical experts onsite when these outbreaks happen so they can address the issues of trying to prevent you from deteriorating when you're sick.</br></br>

UCI: Right.</br></br>
Caller: These conditions that they put us in, it's like an incubation.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br> 

Caller: I mean the air is horrible. I work for the maintenance crew, so I know how the airflow works here.I've worked back there for several years. And the airflow, these machines, they don't work correctly.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br> 

Caller: They're broken and they're old and they're out of date and they can't get the right parts, so they just make them work. Well, they're working is not pulling in fresh air from the outside it's mainly, you know, all recycled air.
