Hey how’s life treating you lately? I hope this letter finds you in good health. I’m writing you guys back because I’m going through a lot right now and I don’t have anyone to talk to. The pandemic hasn’t effected my life very much but it has for others (inmates).</br></br>
 
I don’t get visits at all, I don’t have a girlfriend or wife, my heart belongs to my ex girlfriend but she’d “rather not have contact”… I don’t have friends but I do have a few or one family member but my sister just recently changed her number and left me behind just like the rest of my family did…</br></br>
 
I just focus on becoming a better man and father as well, I have 2 boys that I love with all my heart. Even tho both of my son’s mothers do not have my boys I still have faith that I will get to see them in person one day. I pray to god everynight, I ask him to put a head of Protection over my ex girlfriend which I love with all my heart & soul and her tow sons & our son as well. Even tho my family left me behind, I think of her two boys as my family.</br></br>
 
I want to get out and show her I can be the man she needs & wants me to be. She’s what keeps me moving forward in a positive way, I don’t wanna give up on her until she tells me to. Then I’ll let her live her life, I’ve been depressed lately cause I’m tired of being alone & not having no one who loves or cares about me. I’m trying my best to hang on but its getting harder everyday that passes.</br></br>
 
Well anyways I know I didn’t provide you guys with a lot but I was honest with you guys, I hope everything goes your way in life. Stay safe & much love for you guys and your loved ones
