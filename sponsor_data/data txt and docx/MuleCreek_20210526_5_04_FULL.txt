This story was told by a person incarcerated at Mule Creek.</br></br>

Caller: And they’ve talked to me a couple of times on the phone, I mean, on the card here.</br></br>

UCI: Oh, okay.</br></br>

Caller: Are you listening?</br></br>

UCI: Yes. Did you want to tell your story today or did you have any questions?</br></br>

Caller: No, I have a couple of them that I was gonna tell you about the, well you had the, the virus?</br></br>

UCI: Uh-huh.</br></br>

Caller: Right? The vi- I took the shots and then for two days, I had the chills and sweating. And after that, I had them. And then I went back to get medical and all of a sudden this rain rolls in, and I got the chill back again.</br></br> 

So, I’ve had the chills three times on that thing, but I’m old. I’m 77 years old.</br></br>
 
Well, with the pandemic, when we have all the different places in the different pods, right? And when somebody got sick, they would send them in where, to tables where everybody was- were healthy and they’d try to put them in there and get them all sick and then they’d get sick and they’d have to go somewhere else. It’s kinda weird. Hello?</br></br>

UCI: How has the vaccination situation been like at your facility?</br></br>

Caller: They did everybody already. They had everybody. And we had all kinds of, it’s in a prison, you know, so they just had everybody doing it.</br></br>

We had one, the one girl that takes blood from the inmates, she didn’t wanna take the thing but she does all the blood for them. But she doesn’t say that she wants, she didn’t took no virus. She didn’t want no part of it, no shots. I thought that was kind of odd. It’s a little scary.</br></br>

UCI: How have you been coping with everything?</br></br>

Caller: Pretty good. We’re doing pretty good on the virus part so far. We wouldn’t mind going on the third group but we had the early ones earlier like three months ago we had them.</br></br>

So, we had them, everybody got in a line, so everybody had the chance to take the pill, I mean, taking the, what do you call it? The shots, so we all had the shots. But we’ve had sick people go to different places in the gym and stuff like that, but they’ll put them all together. Kinda weird the way they do that.</br></br>

UCI: How has reduced visitation affected you?</br></br>

Caller: How does it affect me?</br></br>

UCI: Yes.</br></br>

Caller: Well, I was worried about when I first got the virus’ shots, it scared me. But that’s it, the way, I been on good, pretty good of it. But I’m old, remember? 77.</br></br> 

So I hope it takes it good. I’ll probably write something and mail it to you guys, is that what you want? Pox box?</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, you’re more than welcome to write anything you’d like to us to share your story or add onto your story and then you can also send pictures as well. You can draw pictures as well.</br></br>

Caller: Oh yeah? Interesting. She’s your professor?</br></br>

UCI: She’s one of the employees, yeah.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, I wish it was, it’s in my letter here. I wouldn’t mind talking to her or something like that.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah every time you call, it’s just depending who is working that shift.</br></br>

Caller: Oh, okay. Anyway, well, I’ll try to write a little letter to you and go on from there, I guess. Sound good?</br></br>

UCI: Great, thank you so much for calling in today and then, let everyone know about the program. They can feel free to write us or to call in as well.</br></br>

Caller: Okay.</br></br>

UCI: Thank you so much. Have a great day.</br></br>
