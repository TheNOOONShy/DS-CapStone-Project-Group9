This story was told by a person incarcerated at New Folsom.</br></br>

Caller: And there was a very minimum people that got infected here in this prison. It's not, you know, we didn't have bad luck like some other prisons that actually reported more infections. But, this prison did a really good job. And actually, I was one of the members that - porters at the time.</br></br>

They coached us how to clean the whole dayroom, they coached us how to clean the rails from the hallways, the rails from the stairs, the tables. It's a contaminated process that we were doing every morning, and they were actually training us to do that with a disinfectant.</br></br>

And basically, it was also something that we started doing for a little at the beginning, you know. But, other than that, I think that there was a few people there that they said they got infected, but they, it was mild. Like, they were positive, but they just left.</br></br>

They kept them separated in a TDA, that was a special unit where they keep them alone, by themselves. And they kept them there for, I guess, the quarantine process. And then, when they tested negative, they brought them back.</br></br>

But, right away, when anybody tests positive, they'll remove them from the building. They'll put them on a special unit where they were keeping them with a doctor in there and medical staff surveillance.
