<em>This story was told by a person incarcerated at San Joaquin County Jail.</br></br></em> 

Caller: Hello again.</br></br>

UCI: Hi.</br></br>

Caller: Hi. Okay. What I wanted to say most because it's about this whole COVID experience, I know there's all these deaths, and they mostly affect people with preexisting conditions and the elderly and all this stuff. And through my experience with COVID, and, luckily, I had the pleasure of being infected with 20 men at a time.</br></br>

You know, side by side, they've got us all isolated in this one little section together. So, I was able to sort of verify this experience back and forth with all these other people, which is, you know, whole different stages of health and all this stuff. And the experience was primarily the same between us in certain ways. And I think I have it figured out to why people are dying and how to stop them from dying.</br></br>

COVID, itself, it's a mild cold, at best. It's a slight flu. It's nothing. But when you go to sleep at night, something kicks in. Like they sort of hybrid something to it, like this little weapon or something.</br></br>

It's, like, weaponized at nighttime when you go to sleep. And it really kicks in hard, and it attacks any preexisting ailments. Anything that was wrong with you, it kicks it into hyper drive.</br></br>

For instance, I have a tooth that, over a year ago, the filling fell out, and it left like a crater of a tooth. And I was later eating an ice cream from the ice cream man with my kids. And when the frozen [unintelligible], it just shattered my tooth to where there's nothing left but a little stub sticking up where the tooth was. I still need to go get that fixed.</br></br>

And from that, I sometimes have a slight infection in my gum maybe from a piece of food that got stuck in there. And so, my gum at the time when I got the COVID was slightly swollen. I had some type of an infection there.</br></br>

And then, my tongue is just really raw because I'm picking at the damn thing all day. So, normally not a big deal, nothing special. But when I'd go to sleep at night, I'd wake up either in the middle of the night or the next morning or both, and it was like my tongue was so swollen, I could barely talk. And my gums were just on fire.</br></br>

They were just like radioactive. And this would happen only at night when I was sleeping with COVID, just every time. As soon as I'd go to sleep, within 40 or 50 minutes, something had kicked in, and any wound I had would just be inflamed and going out-of-control crazy.</br></br>

So, my theory is that these people, and mostly the elderly, they come into the hospital with these preexisting conditions, like my uncle. Recently, he went in with complications with his diabetes, and then he caught pneumonia in there from it and then, soon after, COVID.</br></br>

And it took him out. He died. And I'm thinking this is because standard... I've been in the hospital many times, have been ill with some serious ailments. And I know hospital protocol is like, when you come in with these conditions, they just lay you down in bed.</br></br>

They want you just to rest it out and just sleep through it all and just get through it that way. And sometimes they even induce coma to get you through it. And I'm thinking it's when they do this process of this that people are killed in their sleep. That's when you die.</br></br>

Because if you have something crazy wrong with you and then COVID attached to it, it's going to get you. It's going to inflame that. It's going to turn into hyper drive, and it's going to get you in your sleep.</br></br>

So, the best way to keep these people alive is, it doesn't matter what the preexisting condition was when they came in and how bad it was, you get these people up. You maintain them. You get them out of bed. You walk them around the room all day.</br></br>

You keep them... You make sure they eat. You just keep them up with their standard daily regimen of what they should be doing without these ailments. Make them endure the pneumonia. Make them endure whatever else is there. Make them suffer through it.</br></br>

Wake them up. Get them out of bed. Keep them out of bed [unintelligible].</br></br>

The COVID goes dormant if you do. It just dies off and just kind of goes dormant when you do this. I went for a day during the COVID where I was like, "Oh, man. It's really getting to me," it will also suppress your appetite and keep you from eating a little bit.</br></br>

And it was like 2/3 of the way through the day, and I started to actually feel sick. I'm like, "Oh, man. This COVID maybe is going to make me feel a little sick." And then I realized, "Oh, shit. I haven't eaten today."</br></br>

And I just went and made a meal and ate it. And ten minutes later, I was back to normal, doing pushups and running around the room. So, yeah, because I mean I get real sick if I don't eat. I need like 5,000 calories a day.</br></br>

So, yeah, just normally I just get sick without eating. So, COVID suppressed my appetite. I was sitting there convincing myself I'm sick, and then I realized, "I haven't eaten." Did that. Back to normal.</br></br>

So, yeah, I think this COVID is seriously something that will only kill you in your sleep. If you stay active... If there's any way you can get that information out there, any sort of nurses or hospitals or doctors or the medical community, it might just save a life.</br></br>

I don't know. I know, from my experience, I wouldn't let anybody go to sleep on this stuff if they have bad ailments or a preexisting... It's not going to go well for them. So, yeah, there's that.</br></br>

UCI: Thank you so much. Yeah, we appreciate that viewpoint.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, just a little cold. It infected me. Or I thought it was infecting me, but really I was infecting it. And I turned inward, and I just studied it, and I paid close attention to what was happening.</br></br>

And then that's my review of what happened there. So, that's my hope. And I feel like there's numbers in the thousands here and there that people are dying, and they're all elderly people and people that come into the hospital sick with something else.</br></br>

And then the COVID kills them. They're like, "Yeah. Do you have something wrong with your intestines or your insides?" It's going to inflame it, and you're - yeah. It's not going to go well. So, yeah, that's it.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah. Thank you so much. We appreciate that, yeah.</br></br>

Caller: And then, [chuckles] it's kind of stupid and a little embarrassing, but the only other final thing I have available at this time is I figured, as my writing skills are getting better, I'm doing okay as a writer and whatnot. And I sing even better.</br></br>

And I was like, hmm. I had this hook floating in my head. I couldn't get it out. And I sat down. I thought to myself, well, if I could write good and I could sing good, why not try writing a song?</br></br>

I've never written a song in my life. It's the first and only song I've ever written. [chuckles] But if you'll humor me, I might just go ahead and just read it out to you here and get your opinion on if it's good or bad.</br></br>

UCI: Absolutely. Absolutely.</br></br>

Caller: Okay, cool. I just sang it in front of, like, seven dudes not too long ago, and they seemed to love it. They're all running around just singing the hook over and over again.</br></br>

They're like, "Damn. That was wonderful." And now, with that being said, I listen to anything really, mostly maybe Rock and Roll, EDM music, Pop, whatever's happening, whatever's good. But what I don't really tend to gravitate towards is Country. I don't listen to that. I couldn't name a single artist really or a single song.</br></br>

But for some reason, when I went to write this song, it came out as a Country song. And I did live in Tennessee for a little over a year, so I know how to talk in a Southern accent a little bit. So, it's a little silly, but I have to sing it slightly with a Southern twang. Normally when I sing, it's in a higher octave, like Coldplay or Five for Fighting or Lewis Capaldi or something.</br></br>

So, yes, this is an entirely different thing for me. I wouldn't mind getting your opinion on it. I'll go ahead and do my best to work my way through that right now. It'll only take about a minute. It's a short song.</br></br>

[Unintelligible]. And a quick backstory is I've been single for a few months here. I don't enjoy being single. I'm a provider and a husband and a father. That's what I do. I'd rather be in a relationship.</br></br>

And right before I came into jail, I met a girl online just by happenstance. I just came across her Instagram thing. I shot her a picture of myself. And there's a video.</br></br>

She had put a video post. She was talking about she was at a camp trip and was complaining about how cute it was that her friend and her husband were hugging and having such a good time and how she wishes she had that or something.</br></br>

So, I shot her a message and a couple pictures of myself, saying, "If you want or need that, maybe just give me a call, and I could remedy that for you," kind of thing. And then she responded, "Oh, my gosh! Do all roofers have a body like that and look like that?" And I said, "Well, I'm into cage fighting," and [unintelligible].</br></br>

And we went from there. I only managed to have one quick date with her where we talked for hours. And I mostly just spewed all this crap about my ex-girlfriend to her. And she stuck it out, and she didn't run out the door. So, that's kind of cool.</br></br>

And when she showed up on my doorstep, she was just like... I was shocked. Some people online, you see pictures of them. But when they arrive, you know, it's ten pounds heavier, 15 pounds heavier and ten years later than the picture you saw. It's just a completely different experience.</br></br>

With her, it was the exact opposite. I opened my door. I had convinced her to come over because I had never dated. I've just always been in relationships. I never go on dates.</br></br>

And I thought it might be awkward to be sitting at a table with a stranger in front of strangers, trying to get to know each other. So, I convinced her to just come over to my house, and she did. And when she showed up on the doorstep, I opened the door and I was just blown away by how beautiful she was. So, I just had to run out and hug her and say, "Thank you for coming over."</br></br>

And then we went and talked, and then she split a little bit later. And we scheduled a second date, where she had mentioned in a text message that she's not looking to be dating and just getting down on it. So, I thought she's only looking for one thing, and that's a lifelong relationship. And I asked her if that included dating, and I just laughed and said that's exactly what I'm looking for.</br></br>

So, it's like we had our first date, and we scheduled a second date. I was like, "I'll see you tomorrow evening," this kind of thing. "Oh, but first I've got to go to court in the morning, and I've got to go to work. And I'll see you after work." And I went to court.</br></br>

And I was like, "Okay, great. I'll see you tomorrow." And so, a second date. I went to court, and they just handcuffed me and brought me right into jail for having missed a court date the prior week. And it just was wrong because I paid them $20,000 for bail, and they just stole it from me by bringing me in here.</br></br>

So, she's answered the phone just twice while I was in here, once to inform me that she's not phishing. She's not looking for a relationship. So, hopefully, she'll be there when I get out. And she [unintelligible] to tell me she had COVID and pneumonia and things weren't well.</br></br>

But I've since got a text message from her through my daughter saying that she's okay and she's been doing better. So, I wrote this stupid little song, and I call it My Angel. It has her name in it, but I'll just switch it to Angel instead of her name. So, here it goes. Okay.</br></br>

I've walked through this world, been all over the place. I traveled the country even at such a young age. Oh, fuck. Wait.</br></br>

I've walked through this world, been all over the place.</br></br>

I traveled the country even at a young age.</br></br>

There was a time I stood ten feet tall,</br></br>

Would've looked you in the face, said I had it all.</br></br>

But as the years rolled by, I had to live my life onstage.</br></br>

I still stand here alone though everyone knows my face.</br></br>

Oh, won't you be my angel?</br></br>

Won't you be my angel?</br></br>

Won't you be my angel?</br></br>

Won't you be my angel?</br></br>

There's been hard times. I've tried so hard to love.</br></br>

But I've been let down, so put my face up above.</br></br>

It's been so easy working so damn hard</br></br>

To give everything, but my heart's full of stars.</br></br>

I pray for a woman. Said I pray for the day</br></br>

When the perfect love might come my way.</br></br>

Oh, won't you be my angel?</br></br>

Won't you be my angel?</br></br>

Won't you be my angel?</br></br>

Won't you be my angel?</br></br>

The first time that I met you, I looked deep into your eyes.</br></br>

The passions have been exploding since my head [unintelligible] to the sky.</br></br>

Now, listen to me carefully. Please, go in just inside</br></br>

To love me, Angie, to hold me, girl,</br></br>

But don't you ever say goodbye.</br></br>

Looked for your love. Then I finally found it.</br></br>

She's raising my spirits to the highest high.</br></br>

Oh, won't you be my angel?</br></br>

Won't you be my angel?</br></br>

Won't you be my angel?</br></br>

Won't you be my angel?</br></br>

Ugh. That's not normally how I sing. I'm a little nervous and embarrassed. I don't sing in front of people. I could do much better than that, but, yeah, that's it.</br></br>

UCI: That was wonderful. That was wonderful.</br></br>

Caller: I was hoping. Yeah, the wording and stuff is kind of well-written, at least, to kind of get my point across. [chuckles]</br></br>

UCI: Absolutely. That was --</br></br>

Caller: Thank you for listening.</br></br>

UCI: Of course. That was so wonderful, and I do hope that she does get to hear it when you get out. That would be awesome.</br></br>

Caller: I won't know until I get out of here. Everything's just on hold. My whole world's on hold, so, yeah, for all I know.</br></br>

UCI: I know. Well, thank you --</br></br>

Caller: There's nothing there waiting for me, but --</br></br>

UCI: Yeah. But, you know, that was so awesome.</br></br>

Caller: - I'll hope for the best, of course.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah. That was so awesome, and we're so grateful, again, for just all you share with us. So, thank you so much for taking the time tonight and sharing that song with me and your story. It just means a lot to our project.</br></br>

Caller: Well, I appreciate you giving it a listen. Thank you so much.</br></br>

UCI: You're welcome.</br></br>

Caller: And I hope to talk to you guys again. Like I said, I'm going to try to go get this tablet back from the CO down here. He's a very nice guy.</br></br>

He might just release it to me. And if I do so, I do have a couple more stories in there I'll quickly transcribe down and add them to the whole book itself. And then I'll give you a call from there.</br></br>

UCI: That's awesome. That's awesome.</br></br>

Caller: Otherwise, I hope to hear from you guys in the future. You've got my number, and you know my name. We'll go from there.</br></br>

UCI: Thank you so much. Have a wonderful night.</br></br>

Caller: All right. You too. Thank you.</br></br>

UCI: Bye.</br></br>

Caller: 'Bye.
