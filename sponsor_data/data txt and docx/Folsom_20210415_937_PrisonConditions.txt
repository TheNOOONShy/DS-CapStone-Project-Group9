This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Folsom.</br></br>Now I don’t know if you know but if an invasion is to hit the United States of America, they must gas all inmates (Look that up for facts please). So back to whatever I was saying, word in the yard is don’t let the ship in our ports, what happens if it comes in to prison, the only way in is from staff, that work here.</br></br>And then I hear in the news San Francisco’s got RED dots one bigger than the other and date is March or April, and rumors of lock downs but no cure of virus and a list of symptoms, and you hear anybody cough or sneeze you get a look, or you give him a look. You give him a look like you hungry for brain?</br></br>Now the news is saying COVID-19 in prisons and is it a reception center or a county jail, we did not know if there are any transfers to courts. There are new laws, but no one is going anywhere. Anybody that went for a resentencing and stayed in a county jail, till it was okay to move inmates again.</br></br>And all this was taking months (Remember prisons are too full capacity of inmate and the state is saying lower capacity, everyone’s to go home specially now). You see the news and other channels say different things, one’s saying out break money bit, no no it WWZ and other news tell you don’t see moves that could worry you with what you are hearing or watching on TV.</br></br>So I’m thinking when I call my mom if she brings it up, will talk about it. And so she tells me are you seeing the news, people are going crazy over toilet paper. I told her shit what happen with washing your ass with water or using leaves. She laughs and I try to keep calm so she would not worry.</br></br>So I told her to tell my brother to go and get some stuff to stock up at home, TP, can food and water, and not to tell no one or they won’t have to go to the store to get some they’ll get it from your house. I continue with the don’t worry about me, everything looks normal in here so far.</br></br>But we were going on a lock down just so if someone gets it, it does not spread. If only she knew that the prisons of America were not prepared for this or knew what to do. And you know in prison you got all kind of people like ex-soldiers, prison veteran’s lawyers, all kind of different professions, don’t forget the know it all’s, and also a much of kids (18 and up) with all kinds of ideas of government conspiracies of what they would do to us.</br></br>Word in the news is San Quentin received a transfer from Chino and the spread is on, wait for it wait for it! One dead, two dead, etc., 20 dead. Moving sick, you know bus transfers are money makers so don’t stop transferring people until they tell us, how’s “they” nobody knows its above pay grade.</br></br>And now in Folsom there putting tents and bathrooms on wheels cost $1.5 million per month. Now I’m thinking I’m fuck! Because if my neighbors got sick, the neighbors from his left and right side would also go to quarantine sick or not.</br></br>So not only sick people were being sent, also people that wasn’t sick was being sent to quarantine. So now it’s looking like concentration camp in Germany. It was looking scary for me, so when correction officer’s announce modify program in the building, (but there will be showers), I said I better let everyone else shower first to see if they put anything in the water or if they were to be gas.
