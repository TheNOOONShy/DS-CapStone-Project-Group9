This letter was written by a person incarcerated at California City Correctional Facility.</br></br>


Good morning to you and all those around and I want to thank you for reaching out to me with well wishes and concerning for our well-being. I received your letter last night in good health and spirits. I was very much surprised.</br></br>


First, we do not know each other and second I receive very little mail. But I’ll do my best to answer your questions and hopefully by the end of this letter you may gain some insight and something positive is gained. When I first heard of COVID-19 I was not worried because I was still in the county jail and information was very limited and it was not in the U.S.</br></br>


So the thought of it affecting my loved ones or myself was quickly dismissed. As it made its way to our country is when it became the talk of the jail and by March it was all anyone talked about. But the only information we got was news or newspapers. The biggest issue I had was I, like most people, I wanted to know if my family caught it would they die.</br></br>


And if they did, how would the jail handle it because that is my biggest fear, is to lose a loved one while being here. In the beginning that was the biggest issue was we all had questions with no answers. I hate using this word but as a inmate you are the very last to receive any notices. Most of the time we are just ordered to do something without any explanation like moving or changing your living situations.</br></br>


Oh and before I get to the part where we have to interact with C.O.s, please know that most inmates harbor hate and bad feelings towards C.O.s. I just want to make it clear that that is not me. I hate no one and understand that my actions are what lead me in here and for the most part the C.O.s are just doing what’s told to them. Most of them.</br></br>


By the time I arrived to prison which was Wasco State Prison in March 2020, we were told that all visits were no longer available. And at this time we were not issued any P.P.E. or instructions how to lower the spread of a virus that we know nothing about and that was the hardest part, was not knowing. While waiting to be housed in Wasco we were all placed in a cell, about 40 inmates per cell.</br></br>


But as I stated before this was in March and at that time the social distance was not implemented and if it was we did not hear of it yet. I received my first mask in the end of April but 95% of people did not wear them. We had to have them on our person but staff did very little to educate us on the importance of wearing them.
