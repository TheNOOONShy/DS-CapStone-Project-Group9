This story was told by a person incarcerated at Donovan.</br></br>

UCI: And how has your facility been dealing with this?</br></br>Caller: On the facility in which I'm housed, it is a what is called an in-field complex. The housing units contain four pods. They're shaped like an X. And each spoke of the wheel, so to speak, has 11 cells and each cell holds six prisoners.</br></br> 

So, it is dormitory settings. Though they're small, there's only six inmates per cell, they are dormitory settings and as such it is impossible to maintain a six-foot distance from other inmates cause you're just housed in such close proximity in a cell.</br></br> Well for as far as the administration and staff they do enforce the wearing of face masks. Most of the staff were lackadaisical in the wearing of face coverings themselves. Until just recently one of the prisoners in this facility filed a grievance against staff members of rank for not wearing their mask. That action was successful and now they've become very militant about wearing a mask and making sure that inmates do as well.</br></br> UCI: So, have they, from the beginning of the outbreak to now have they, besides the masks, have they made any other changes?</br></br>Caller: Yes. They have started placing dispensers of antiseptic hand sanitizer that is being produced by prison industry authority. They're putting that in the center areas of the buildings for inmate use.</br></br> 

The cleaning chemicals that are distributed to the inmate population on a weekly basis, they've been much more generous with the amounts of cleaning chemicals and the ability to access cleaning materials such as mops, brooms, scrub brushes, all of that has been increased exponentially. Basically beginning in about the month of June, they started really stepping it up on cleaning chemicals.</br></br> UCI: What do you think would make the situation at your facility better?</br></br>Caller: Number one, in light of the fact that it is literally impossible to maintain a safe distance from your co-inhabitants, the cells are equipped in such a configuration that there are two bunkbeds and then there are two single bunks.</br></br> 

If they were to remove the occupants of the top bunks, thereby decreasing the number of individuals per cell to only four instead of six it would alleviate the congested fact, excuse me, congestive factor and allow for a more appropriate social distancing, even inside the housing units themselves.
