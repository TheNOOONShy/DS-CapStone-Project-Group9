This story was told by a person incarcerated at Corcoran.</br></br>

UCI: What do you think could make the situation at your facility better? So, what would you like to see them do to help you guys?</br></br>

Caller: For them to send the right cleaning stuff which was in one of those barrels that will come from CDC from that hospital, every time they will come in here like daily. And we will clean the walls, and clean the windows and where we sit at, like our living quarters. But we haven't been cleaning this like, for a while.</br></br>

So, that I would like to see that happen and like for these masks for us to get them on a daily use. And when someone shows symptoms of being sick and they're saying they're sick, to be seen right away and not have to wait two weeks.
