This story was told by a person incarcerated at Centinela.</br></br>

Caller: Caller: Oh, okay. So they were administering these tests right. They were every Thursday but I think now that this whole building that I’m in has been vaccinated, I believe they’re just random now, you know.</br></br>

I haven’t been tested in a few weeks, but I don’t have any symptoms or anything, you know, so it’s not like I, no complaints you know. In my opinion, this prison’s done pretty well actually with COVID, you know, to the best of their ability, if you ask me.</br></br>

I mean, but not everybody feels the same, you know. But I’m not one to look at all the negative. I try to look at everything, you know, glass half-full. I don’t know. You know some people complain over little shit, you know.</br></br>

Yeah, but as far as cases, I’ll say for the first, back in October I was pretty worried. I was pretty worried. Especially after my sister passed away and all that, yeah I was really worried. I got really worried.</br></br>

And then I finally - I barely got vaccinated in March, so the stress from October, November, December, January, those four months, that four-month period, that was like a nail-biter, you know. That was pretty, it kinda wears on you, you know.</br></br>

But after I got the vaccination, you know, I don’t really, you know, worrying won’t help me at this point, you know. So I kinda just take it as is, you know.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah. So how have you been coping with all this crisis, this situation?</br></br>

Caller: Well, I run a mile a day. I run a mile a day, I work out, I try to stay healthy, healthy as possible, you know. That’s my stress reliever.</br></br>

That’s how I keep, you know, myself from going crazy, I guess, you know. Exercise definitely. Yeah, that’s about it really.
