Hi.</br></br>

How are you? Fine, I hope and pray.</br></br>

I’m okay, it’s been hard going through this pandemic but in the end it’s all God’s-will! And we have to go through hell to get to Heaven.</br></br>

This is prison, we’re here to be “punished,” so we’re treated as so! It’s “normal” for the staff to treat us as scum. We’re looked at as animals, commodity, or just criminals. And I won’t go too deep, because you know “they” hate “the whistleblower!!” I’m not in “denial,” I did the crime I’m here for but there’s more to me than my past mistakes!</br></br>

I have a seven year old daughter that I haven’t seen in four years and I’m very remorseful- if I had another chance I wouldn’t have done my crime which I got 26 years for. It hurts being away from my daughter- I love her with all my heart! My child’s mother caught COVID but was blessed to get over it. Other than that all my family are healthy! Thank God!!</br></br>

I haven’t took the vaccine yet, I’m waiting on them to offer us a better incentive than the one free photo they’ve been rewarding. Well, if any retaliation comes my way for my writing you please tell my daughter I love her, take some flowers to my brother, and kiss my grandmother for me. Thank you, for listening, God bless you!</br></br>

With respect.</br></br>

Sending out shots to all my Kansas City family and homies, I love y’all!</br></br>

WallyWorld I got us! Arrruf.
