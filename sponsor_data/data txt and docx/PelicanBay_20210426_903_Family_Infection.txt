This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Pelican Bay.</br></br>For example, I haven't been able to speak to my kid's mother or my son for over a month, due to the fact that when they come to your door to offer you a call it's the only chance you get period. My kid's mother works graveyard so in the morning she is asleep. But at 9 a.m. here comes the CO that you either get a hold of your loved ones or you don't.</br></br>Even trying to explain the situation is a moot point because no exceptions are made. It's really frustrating and nerve wrecking because during the whole time you are just worried and concerned for their health and safety. All you can do is hope the next time they come for your phone call it is at a time where you can reach your loved ones and not again at 9 a.m. where you are filled with disappointment and frustration.</br></br>As for the vaccinations, they came through in December or early January, but I didn't get it because a few concerns and questions I had couldn't be answered, so it discouraged me. Then just last week they sent me a notice that I could get the vaccine by submitting a medical request. However, one of the vaccines was the J&J vaccine and with the blood clot situation again I am not encouraged to get it until I feel it is safer. It's just crazy times, to say the least.</br></br>I feel safer than my loved ones and I worry about them. My loved ones feel safer than me and worry about me here! And I can't help but feel for the people who lost loved ones due to this virus. It is a very difficult time indeed and 2020 was a year that we collectively couldn't wait for. Now all the world wants to do is forget it ever existed.
