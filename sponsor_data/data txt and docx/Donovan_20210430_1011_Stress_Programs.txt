This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Donovan.</br></br>

Hi, I am writing you on behalf of your letter you sent in regards to our struggle since COVID-19 hit. I’ve been in prison for around three years after being convicted in 2016. I was charged with pre-meditated murder, with a sentence of life without the possibility of parole.</br></br> 

Obviously everybody comes to prison with their own story and their own values and morals. My case is a high profile case based around serious neglect of my mental health, spiritual warfare with supernatural forces, and demonic attack and persecution.</br></br>

Due to the circumstances of my struggle I am in a mental health program also known as [redacted]. Our program is more limited when it comes to the hands on more physical activities. Since COVID-19 hit we have been limited to visiting as well, which has increased our struggle. I am an active Christian and prophet so on top of being incarcerated I spend everyday being persecuted.</br></br>

I basically walk around and live cut in pieces. My sternum feels basically opened up, and something has my heart hanging out and is constantly torturing me. I’m barely clinging to life some days. I believe it is spiritual but possibly nuclear or digital terrorist.
