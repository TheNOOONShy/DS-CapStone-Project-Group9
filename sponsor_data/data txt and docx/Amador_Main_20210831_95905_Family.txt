This story was told by a person incarcerated at Amador County Jail.</br></br>

Caller: Sure, yes, sir. So, I guess that's it. Our families are going through it just as bad. Our families tries to call up here. Our families try to call up here and they get the runaround, you know. They - everything is just a - everything's all a runaround, a runaround.</br></br>

Our family puts money - our families put money into these tablets so we could get these tablets and we can't even get tablets so we can see our children, you know. My son is â€“ I've spent my whole life incarcerated, well, pretty much, and my son, I've been in prison the whole time. And, you know, he's 20 years old, I spent almost 20 years of his life behind bars.</br></br> 

At least I would have been able to visit him before, prior COVID. But, due to COVID I can't - I can't see nobody, you know. I can't.</br></br>

You know, and then they shut down the front office here so that way our people can't even come in and put money on our account, you know. So, I can't even - I can't even get money for a phone call, you know, to call my people. And it's not just me, there's numerous people that are going through that.</br></br> 

And that's all I wanted to share with you guys. Thank you guys very much.
