4/26/21</br></br>This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Kern Valley.</br></br>To whom it might concern, I send my best wishes and hope everyone is in good health. I’m writing in response to your missive. To be honest, I was really surprised to receive your letter.</br></br>I also felt honored to be able to contribute to your research. I promise to take your questions very seriously and answer them as honestly possible to my recollection.</br></br>I must apologize for not addressing this letter specifically. On the letter you mentioned you’re  professor [redacted] and it was signed: [redacted]. I’m writing to you, [redacted] right and did I spell your name correctly?</br></br> I’m sorry if I messed that up. I just want to know I’m writing someone directly. If I get a response, can you please clarify this? Thank you.</br></br>Now I’m going to share my experiences with you. On February 2020 around 10:30 am., my cellmate was having a medical emergency.</br></br>I made the COs (correctional officers) aware of the situation. They seen he couldn’t walk so they sounded the alarm. They rushed our cell and I was placed in handcuffs.</br></br>They asked me if he had used any drugs. I answered “No, he hasn’t.” But they ignored my response. So they proceeded like it was an overdose.</br></br>They were administering the narcan to my cellmate and I started yelling “He’s not fucking OD-ing!” They shot him a few times with the adrenaline shot and then they took him. I must make clear the medical staff was the one handling the “allege” overdose.</br></br>I was taken out a couple of hours later and was question, photograph (my whole body) and asked to provide them with a DNA sample.</br></br>At this point I didn’t know what was going on. I was placed in a small phone booth like cage and then served with a lock-up order. A lock up order means you are being placed in administrated segregation or the hole.</br></br>I asked the CO what is the meaning of this and he looked at me with a confused expression. Well your celly died, he told me. “What?” I asked. I was totally floored with the news, frozen. I couldn’t believe it! My cellmate was only 30 years old! And he has only 18 months left to his release after being down 10 years.</br></br>
Once the shock passed, I started to cry. Because when you live with a person for six months and are basically all day together one of two things happen: you either love them or hate them. And I had a lot of love for my cellmate.</br></br>We were good friends. [Redacted] was his name.</br></br>So on February 2020 I found myself in ad seg or the hole. I was single cell, not allowed to have a cellmate. The COs investigating this case took all my property: clothes, food, TV, mail, pictures, and all my addresses and phone numbers.</br></br>It felt like they didn’t want me to communicate with anyone. I unfortunately didn’t have any numbers or addresses memorized. As a matter of fact, as I write this missive (4/26/21) more than a year later, I still haven’t received none of my property back.</br></br>Anyways, around mid March 2020 was the first time I heard of the phrase COVID-19. I heard it through the COs, nurses, and other inmates talking about it.</br></br>By now I knew I was in ad seg under investigation for what happened with my celly. I was mourning my friend and these people are telling me that I’m being investigated for what happened. I was supper stressed out.</br></br>As March progress and April came around, I only heard nothing but bad news. It was like the saying about the snowball on top of the hill. The bad news came in bigger increments from bad to worst.</br></br>I have no TV so all my information was second and third hand. I don’t have my address book, so I can’t write a letter and ask my loved ones how they are doing.</br></br>Well, by loved ones I mean my girlfriend and her kids. My parents and my younger sister are in Mexico in the state of Michoacán. And I’m almost to the point of paranoia with worry.</br></br>My younger brother ( I’m the oldest, he’s the middle child and my sister is the youngest) is also incarcerated and I have no idea how [redacted] State Prison is doing with the pandemic.</br></br>So there you have it, the scenario: I’m in the hole single cell, with none of my stuff. I’m being investigated for my cellmate’s sudden death. I’m sad for his passing but also scared because the implications of an investigation means only one thing. To see if I’m somehow accountable.</br></br> On top of that I’m worry sick for my family but have no way to contact them. Bad times indeed.</br></br> I was in ad seg for four months and I eventually got a letter from my girlfriend. They also started giving us phone calls every two weeks. That made things a lot better. They also started mandating that we wear masks which was fine with me.</br></br>Towards the fourth month of my stay in ad seg, I kept asking them what’s going on with my situation. They always answered “Oh because the corona virus we can’t get the coroner’s report, oh because COVID-19 this or that.”</br></br>I guess after a while they had to kick me out of the hole. Back to the main line and general population. Since they still had all my property I only arrived with a box of a little bit of food, hygiene, a t-shirt, state shoes, and my boxes of underwear.</br></br>Yep, it was kind of embarrassing. However I was happy to out of the hole.</br></br>Program changed, yard was only one building at a time and split the day room. I guess to contain the virus.</br></br>Then we went on full lockdown when COVID cases went up drastically. It happened twice, no yard, day room, or school. On the second lockdown we heard that someone from our yard (B yard) had passed away from COVID-19 complications.</br></br>Sometime during that period around November 2020 I started going through some symptoms. Excuse my horrible spelling. I was weak, lightheaded, I had really bad headaches, my heart started racing, I had shortness of breath.</br></br>I had to ask for medical attention at least three times and they just told me that I was having a panic attack and anxiety. They checked my vitals and my temperature, and I guess they didn’t see anything abnormal.</br></br>I asked if I can be checked out by cardiologist but they shot me down because I wrote on a totally different medical slip “I don’t need medical attention.” But I wrote that totally unrelated to the symptoms I described above.</br></br>Later, one of the staff told me straight up, that we were not getting the care we have coming because of COVID-19. I then realized that they started using that excuse for a lot of things.</br></br>I guess I understand the CDCR was probably overwhelmed and over all they did an OK job of keeping us safe. But me having these scary symptoms felt that I needed urgent help. Till this day I don’t know if I caught COVID-19, but I still feel some small symptoms. I just feel a little traumatized.</br></br>By February 2021 they offered us the Moderna vaccine. I already took both of my shots. Now is the end of April and we are getting visits. I already got a few.</br></br>
They are running canteen (commissary items) food sale and packages. I’m also attending a self-help program (drug abuse) and school.</br></br>So after a pretty fucked up year excuse my language. Things are slowly starting to look normal. I only pray that our people, our families take good care of themselves. I took the vaccine just to show my parents and my girl that is safe. They don’t trust it, so I had to assure them it was safe.</br></br>Well, I wrote a mighty long story. Sorry about that, but I actually felt good getting some stuff off my chest. So I thank you and UC[redacted] of [redacted] for the opportunity.</br></br>Any questions, please feel free to contact me. I will place a call to make sure this letter got there. I send good vibes and best of wishes to you.</br></br>Sincerely. </br></br> Fact Note: I already took both Moderna vaccine. I’m going to call to make sure this letter is founded.</br></br>
