Dear PrisonPandemic Project,</br></br>

Hello. I appreciate you all taking the time to correspond with and ask after my well being. I hope you are all well and good.</br></br>

What has it been like to be inside during this time? Prison is a harsh environment regardless, but the virus has decreased the redistribution of rehab programs, college courses, and all together learning.</br></br>

Our outside recreation programming has been significantly reduced and access to day room and showers have been affected. No day room, you either shower in the morning or evening. This is more like being in segregated housing.</br></br>

How do you feel about your safety inside? Truthfully, I feel better now that the nurses have stopped coming into the building to test us. The greatest potential for a pandemic or an epidemic to reach us inmates. It must come from one of the officers, nurses, or free staff and visitors.</br></br>

Every week it was like casting lots to see whose program would face upheaval. Or if you refuse to test, they threaten to deny you a package or freedom of movement. The violation of my federal rights were not nice but are now over.</br></br>

What has it been like to be inside without visits? I’ve actually never had a visit, so when they stopped us from using the phone it was dismaying to be unable to hear my mother’s, sister’s, and brother’s voice. I had to learn from here that my niece and nephew tested positive three years and one year, respectively, for COVID-19. They are well now.</br></br>

And how have you been coping with this crisis? I continue to pray for everyone’s safety. I have only been sick once and 32 years of my life for 24 hours and no longer. So for me, it was the word of God, studying chemistry and Brazilian Portuguese, history, and exercise. I speak with my family as much as possible and attempt to stay positive, though at times I have dark thoughts. These things can be rather disconcerting.
