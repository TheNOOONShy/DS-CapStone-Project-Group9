4. And how have you been coping with this crisis?</br></br> 
I've been trying to make the best of my time under these very limited options. OK. I've used the phone a lot more than I normally would. I'm writing more letters which my family and friends love getting. I even taken my time and did a “spring cleaning” of my locker, drawer, and common areas. I went through my property to decide what I really needed and what I did not through a process of elimination because I for one do not like any clutter and I am not a hoarder. That way my areas are clean and tidy which I love. I have also taken to read more books and watching more TV. Mostly the news because I'm very concerned about what is going on in the world that's now affecting all of us.
