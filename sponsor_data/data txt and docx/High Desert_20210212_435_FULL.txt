Let me start off by saying thank you for getting at us inmates that really fill like we are forgotten at times and I would love to share a little bit of what is going on during the COVID-19 pandemic.</br></br>

First of all not all prisons are the same as being a inmate in a California prison for well over 20 years I have never been as scared as I am right now. And I have been through it all. When COVID hit this yard that I am on not less than 48 hours later there was over 600 inmates that tested positive for COVID-19.</br></br>

We don’t know how it got to us but it did. Now all 600 of us were placed in buildings away from other inmates which was expected, and we were all thankful for that. So now that they can focus on helping us to get better, but it really didn’t happen like that. We sat here and waited.</br></br>

The administration of this prison spread the COVID-19 to other yards at this prison they moved people that had cellys that were infected with COVID-19 to other yards for what reason is beyond me. There was no excuse for it. The other yards got COVID-19 within days. As well some yards got it week after, but it was all spread by their doing.</br></br>

We have on B yard were locked in our cell which was to be expected. But when were we to receive medication for our symptoms. We never did. We all had to suffer with out meds. Some people died. It was all really horrifying to go through. Me as a person of the world, because inmate or not I am a person, but some will argue on that. I was scared for all human kind. </br></br>

I care for all lives. There is no other way to think plan. And simple how are we to overcome anything with selfishness. It's not possible. Now after we were infected food started to get shorten, which was already on a dietary level.</br></br> 

As it is, us inmates were denied to fend for our selfs with our own money. We were not allowed to go to store. So not only did we get the COVID-19 from the administration, it starved the inmate population in HDSP, and it get worse. Or us inmates do have money on our inmate accounts that the administration handles, as well we are allowed a package from 3 companies that they have approved for us, which we are thankful for. But when we tried to send out our order forms to those package companies, for some reason we are not able to do so, which is our right to do so.</br></br>

So still I remind you, it is a lose lose situation with us inmates at HDSP. My package from that has been moved into sitting in the accounting office for the past 2 months. Some inmates have no family to do things for them, so they rely on the prison administration to do for them. That is the way they make it so when we ask them we get no answer, or no real answer we should say, from them.</br></br>

And will we ever get a real answer, who knows. And the other thing that really worrying us so will we ever see our family again touch, hold, see their smile, hear them laugh.</br></br>

COVID-19 has put all of us in here through so much. I really feel sorry for the inmates that died all alone in a cell with no hope in site, with people that are supposed to care for our well being looking on like they have no answers for the lives. They are supposed to protect us.</br></br>

Inmates go through more than people out there realize. Did we do this to ourselves? Yes we did put ourself in prison. But does that make us less human? I would hope not to you at the PrisonPandemic project. Thank you for your concern and giving me the time to spread the truth about whats going on in prison with COVID-19.

Best wishes</br></br>
