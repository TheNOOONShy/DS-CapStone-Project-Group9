Dear PrisonPandemic,</br></br>

Hey, thank you for reaching out to me. I would love to tell you how my experience in OCJ (Theo Lacy Facility) has been so far.</br></br>

Since I arrived at the jail, myself, as well as several others were placed in a quarantine mod, which means we’re in two man cells and we are allowed out for 30 minutes a day for a shower and a phone call. There is a little speaker by the door with a button on it that connects you to the officers, but that is to only be used for emergency situations.</br></br>

The officers do routinely walk around to do checks every 15-30 minutes, I give them that. Other than that, it’s mainly just sitting in my cell, working out, eating, and watching TV. Oh yeah, also, you can see the TV from your cell lol.</br></br> 

Sadly, I am used to this lifestyle, so I am never really concerned with my safety inside, jail is jail you know? If you know how to carry yourself, then you will be good. As far as my safety goes with my health and protection from COVID, I feel good about it.</br></br>

There’s not much contact with other inmates, and if we go out to the nurse or video-court, then we have to wear a mask. I forgot to mention, court hearings are through an iPad inside a cell, so that’s also more reduced contact with people.</br></br> 

I am originally from New Jersey and I know the virus hit New Jersey heavily. But I keep in contact with my mother, who is down in Florida, to make sure my family in New Jersey is okay.</br></br>

There are workers who do walk arounds every day offering COVID tests and COVID vaccines, and it is up to the inmate if they want it or not. I took a test when I first got here, which came up negative. I refused my other one because I am comfortable where I’m at, and my release date is next week!</br></br> 

I’m scheduled to leave on April. God willing. If I do happen to get released, I will call your hotline from my cell phone. I have been here for 40 days and was sentenced to 90 days with half (45 days), so I got very lucky.</br></br> 

Hopefully, I can change my life when I get out. Honestly, I am grateful this happened, because I had a severe drug problem, and coming here got me clean, sober, and healthy again! I’m super into working-out/exercise so I’ve gotten very in-shape during my stay here. Who knows what would have happened to me out there, you know?</br></br> 

Anyways, I’m very grateful that you reached out to me, and that you found my name on the website. I hope that what I wrote helps you out with your project and your studies. Don’t do drugs and stay in school! Lol. This place is not where anybody wants to be, trust me.</br></br>

PS Sorry about the envelope lol. I draw it when I was bored one day, and it’s the only one I have. I didn’t think I was gonna use it, enjoy the drawing!</br></br> 

Sincerely.
