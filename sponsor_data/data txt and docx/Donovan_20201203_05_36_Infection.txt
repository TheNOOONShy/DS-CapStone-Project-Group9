This story was told by a person incarcerated at Donovan.</br></br>

UCI: What is the current COVID-19 situation at your facility?</br></br>

Caller: During the entire pandemic, there has only been four documented cases of inmates contracting the coronavirus. There have been no cases on the housing facility which I am housed in.</br></br> 

UCI: How has the COVID-19 situation at your facility affected your loved ones?</br></br>

Caller: Uh my loved ones, unfortunately I have outlived most of my family members.</br></br> 

UCI: Oh, sorry to hear that.</br></br>

Caller: Where I'm at now is, for the most part, basically a geriatric care facility.</br></br> 

You have a vast number of elderly individuals who are mobility impaired. They're either in wheelchairs or utilize other assistive devices such as walkers or canes. And they're, they're, they're at severe high risk. There are, there are a variety of individuals who are either hearing impaired or deaf. There's an entire deaf community on this yard.</br></br> 

You even have some visually impaired individuals. So, there's, there's a plethora of individuals who fall under the category of the Americans with Disabilities Act and I got to tell you, the amount of care being given to these individuals is not what I would like to see it be.</br></br> 

UCI: Okay. So, how would you, or what are some recommendations or things that you would change to make the situation better for those individuals?</br></br>

Caller: For the, for the individuals who are, for example, for the individuals who are under the Americans with Disabilities Act, a lot more care and caution should be made as far as the population itself, deep in the population and thereby reducing the contact.</br></br> 

The volume of cleaning supplies and means of keeping things sanitary in the housing units is sufficient. However, the number of cases here at this particular prison is so miniscule. We've only had four cases since the pandemic began.</br></br> 

Unfortunately, the administration still refuses to upgrade from the lower-level phase groups that control how much inmate movement, whether or not we are allowed contact visiting, and so on.</br></br> 

Uh and these kinds of concerns, if individuals were to be allowed to have the appropriate level of face consideration that they should be having it would ease a lot of tensions and diametrically decrease the stress levels in the institutional environment, twelvefold.</br></br>
