This story was told by a person incarcerated at Los Angeles County Men's Central Jail.</br></br>

UCI: How has COVID been like in the facility that you're in right now?</br></br>

Caller: It's just – it's not well – it's not doing well. Because, like I said, I've been here. I caught it in here.</br></br> 

I've been out there for all this whole time I've came in here. And then never caught COVID being out in the public. And I come here and everybody's this close – so close.</br></br>

And, they're sometimes, I heard they're putting in people like directly from the streets into our - our dorms and living areas, without testing them or quarantining them. So that's how I ended up getting it in, you know, in August.</br></br>

It took me from the end of April to August to get it. I got – ended up getting COVID. I had a bad headache</br></br>. 

And I reported to the nurses, as nurses come to your cell like two, three times a day, anyways, for pills, you know, to take – bring medication to other inmates. And I told them I wasn't feeling well, if I could get like an ibuprofen or something.</br></br>

And this, oh, you have to submit a paperwork, you know, submit a paper, submit a paper. So I did, later on that evening. And that was like on Friday. And that's when I started feeling the symptoms.</br></br>
 
I just had like a bad headache. And it was a bad headache and dizziness. And that was like Friday, Saturday. And then, Sunday, I lost my taste.</br></br>

And, like I said, I had already submitted the paper. So, then, they didn't call me to medical until Tuesday. And so I was exposed to all those people.</br></br>

And, now, Tuesday – but there was like - there was like 18 of us in that dorm. Because it was a privilege dorm. So it was only 18 of us, where, normally, there's 64 people.</br></br>

And they - and so there was like six of us, out of the 18, that were sick. Because they were bringing in people from the streets, and like directly into our, you know, our living area. Which is only supposed to be for veterans any – for military veterans. That's why we only had 18 people in there.</br></br>

UCI: And so did you just have any fever or anything like that?</br></br>

Caller: No. I had no fever, no nothing. I had no fever. I just had dizziness. Like I put my head down and I got like a automatic, instant headache.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: And then, when I picked up my head, I'd feel like dizzy, like I was going to faint.</br></br>

UCI: Mhmm.</br></br> 

Caller: I was like what the heck? So I knew something was wrong because I never get sick.</br></br>

UCI: Mhmm. Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: I asked them. And then, after – yeah, so, Tuesday, they called me to medical. And - and then, they brought me down to downtown. Because they said that what I told them – all the symptoms I had – that they felt I had COVID.</br></br>

So they brought me downtown. And they tested me. And then, the next day, yeah, they said I had COVID. And then, after – but they said, at that time, already, by Tuesday, I was already asymptomatic. Because I didn't have no symptoms.</br></br> 

UCI: Mhmm.</br></br>

Caller: I didn't have no fever. I didn't have no headache no more, nothing. So, for me, it only lasted three, four days. And, after that, so they kept me there for like – what – like 11 days.</br></br>

UCI: Oh, okay.</br></br>

Caller: 11 days. And they were coming to - to test me for like – twice a day – whatever – my vitals and whatnot. But, the living - just living there, I didn't feel was - was right either. Because we were with COVID.</br></br>

And they were bringing other people in there, too – in your - in your cell. You know? So it was two of us that had COVID.</br></br>

UCI: Oh. So they just brought random people in there, who just like didn't have COVID at all?</br></br>

Caller: No. No. They had COVID, supposedly. They had COVID, but-</br></br>

UCI: Oh, okay.</br></br>

Caller: But still, it's like how are we supposed to get better if-</br></br>

UCI: Yeah. If they're just introducing more.</br></br>

Caller: We didn't have the same amount of days. You know?</br></br>

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah. So it feels like it’s cross contamination.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah. How was the -</br></br> 

Caller: And, living there, it sucks. It sucks. Because they don't change your clothes or – I thought, from what I read, it said like you have to get rid of the clothes you had if you're sick. You know?</br></br> 

UCI: Mhmm.</br></br>

Caller: As soon as you get there or whatnot.
