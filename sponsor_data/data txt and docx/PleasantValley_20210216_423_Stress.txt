I was told by medical personnel here that I had COVID, I never felt any symptoms or experienced anything concerning, for that I’m blessed yet still confused on its potential for damage to people's lives and health.</br></br>


I do have elderly parents who use supplemental oxygen, live-in healthcare provider, prime candidates for worst case outcome with COVID! As of today I’m lucky to report they are still above ground, healthy as their ages and conditions allow. I do understand the possibility of never getting to hug my mother again if she does contract the virus, and honestly its a reality I’d prefer not to think about or stress on until that time comes because there isn’t anything I can do but hate myself for choosing to put myself in this position by my actions!! Honestly I just hope for the best, deal with the mess if and when the time comes!</br></br>


As for others I see them affected by no family visits, worry about loved ones, the normal. I think because they claim so many of us had the virus yet nobody really was affected extremely bad or lack of death within the prison, most people don’t take the situation as seriously as they should . . .</br></br>


I believe had the virus taken more of a toll health-wise or more people affected by the loss of loved ones in the free world . . . The average person here is too much of an idiot to understand what’s going on in other places, or too ignorant to take the time to notice what’s going on around them, let alone what’s happening elsewhere in the world!</br></br>
