Theme: Infection: Vaccines

UCI: How has the vaccination situation been like at your facility?</br></br>

Caller: It’s pretty good. As soon as they’re- they’re allowed vaccinations. I think I got my first one, oh shoot. Maybe. I don’t know, it’s been a while. They- they came around. Anybody who wanted one, got one.</br></br>
In the beginning, those who got COVID, it was on paper, they got COVID, they couldn’t take them until 90 days or maybe, 75 days later. And it- when their time was up, they came around and tested- I mean asked if they wanted the vaccination and, you know. They shot them with it and three weeks later, they shot them again. And- and you know it was.</br></br>
It was our- our facility, our yard. It’s pretty much a- it’s open enough. You know, we’re starting school, just for our building, so you know we’re having contact with our precinct staff now and. You know, most of them have been vaccinated, some haven’t.</br></br>
You know, that’s basically been our situation. If you have it, that’s on you but most of us have protected ourselves and- just so it doesn’t hit us as hard as it did last time but. Yeah, the vaccinations they’re. They’re pretty much- they’re in full swing. I mean, anyone who wants one, wants one- if you want one now, and you didn’t want one earlier, and that you refused. You can write them- and you write the sick call slip and they’ll call you in. They’ll put you in- they’ll just call you up and give you a vaccination.</br></br>

Caller: Oh yeah well, I had to get like you know, video visits. And you know, they give us video visits here. Well, at in the beginning when they did charge video visits, it was once a month for half an hour</br></br>
