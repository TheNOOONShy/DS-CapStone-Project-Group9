This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Susanville.</br></br>

My story starts at Maryland, California. I heard about COVID-19 it was December 2019, and they cancelled visiting. I haven’t seen my family since April that year. I got transferred to another facility because that one got closed.</br></br>

I arrived a Susanville CCC March 17, 2020. About one month later things only got worse.</br></br>It went to half the population to just one building at a time it was 34 and got reduced to 24 people out on the yard for one hour. So you had to make a choice from going to get your package or calling phone or eat or library. And you only got to come out about every two or three weeks. And then had nothing for about two to three months lockdown.</br></br>Our building serviced the second wave the three waves came and all hell broke loose. One guy came up positive so they split us up put ten of us in an empty building and 10 more people a positive. The move more people from another building that they were expose to COVID. They sent them in with us. Long story short we all got it.</br></br>It was impossible to avoid no matter how much we cleaned. Our water down disinfectant didn’t kill it. I got off quarantine and moved again and got in next in with another 24 people who were all positive. I got off insulation but that time I felt like I had a bad cold. I lost my smell had body aches, runny nose, coughing and shortness of breath.</br></br> 

I went back to work as the yard crew I was the only one out there and a couple of others.</br></br>I saw the whole yard for the first time in about 12 months. January was here now it was a messed up year. No school location or self-help group or worship service. I thought everything will get better but no not yet.</br></br> 

I work serving food to all the population accept for about two buildings that didn’t offer it. Then I clean one yard and I see my friends suck and starving.</br></br>It was very sad they couldn’t even make calls to their love ones. So I did the best I could to give them extra trays and whatever food I had. And call their love ones and let them know that they were sick and were going to be OK and they love them.</br></br> 

It was the same story for all my friends. They had the same message.</br></br>I told my family and was wondering why they didn’t that I contracted a deadly virus. But I survived a lot people were dropping like dominos the ambulances was on the yard about four times. All hours of the night too. It weigh heavily on my heart.</br></br> 

Because I was lonely I was out but I was sad to see all my friends and I couldn’t do anything to help them except pray for them and hope they get out of the infirmary.</br></br>We all wished there no deaths. But some still have the effects. I got both of my shots. I also got to get a 30 minute visit with my family in March 2021. It’s been two years now things are opening up.</br></br> 

We got 84 days of staying out of trouble. Education, location, self help groups, and library supposedly were supposed to get more time off. But now they’re closing this facility.</br></br>I would like to thank you PrisonPandemic for putting the light on my struggles. And I also want to thank PrisonPandemic for contracting me. And I also want to tell all my fellow inmates keep your head up and move forward it’s not ever until it’s over.</br></br>  

God bless and take care of yourself we will get through this together, it will be better.
