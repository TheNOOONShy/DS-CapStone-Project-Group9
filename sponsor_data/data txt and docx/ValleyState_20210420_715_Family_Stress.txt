Another thing I want to share about this pandemic is the inmate telephone system. There are eight telephones in the dayroom. Out of nowhere, CDCR decides to limit the phone usage. Allowing us to use only four phones during our two hours of dayroom.</br></br>

Each hallway has a total of 64 inmates. By only allowing us to use the four telephones, in that two hour time frame, it only allows 32 of the 64 inmates to call home. Adding stress to the already existing stress from the pandemic. Now we can’t stay in touch with our loved ones, our friends, and our support network.</br></br>

CDCR pushed us further from our family and friends. Their reason was so they can spray the phones down with Cellblock 64 and let the chemicals sit for 15 minutes. Why, of all places, did they choose to implement this procedure on the telephones? Our only source and connection with home.</br></br>

It made no sense, and showed a lack of empathy and compassion on CDCR’s behalf. No other place at the prison did they practice this procedure. The only place was our telephones.</br></br>

Today is April 2021 and I still get tested every week. I got my first vaccination shot last month. I’m waiting on my second shot. I owe all my health and positive mind-frame to my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. I am still alive and standing because of him.</br></br>

College was another way I coped with this pandemic. Also the book club I’m in helped me. Thank you for allowing me to share my experience and my opinions.
