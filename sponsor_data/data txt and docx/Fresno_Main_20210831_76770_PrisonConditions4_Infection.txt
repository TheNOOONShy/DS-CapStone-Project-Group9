This story was told by a person incarcerated at Fresno County Jail.</br></br>

Caller: No one don't comes and tell us, "Hey, look, this guy did this." Or whatever the case may be,  "we have a case positive in your pod." They don't - no one comes and say that. They just come and put an orange paper on the window, and we're on lockdown for the next 14 to 21 days.</br></br>

So, I - you know, the sheriff don't even send the medical staff in like they did with the mumps. With the mumps, the medical staff came in and they spoke to us. You know what I mean? They came from pod to pod, and they spoke to us and told us how to do this and do that. With the pandemic, they don't do that.</br></br>

You know what I mean? When - earlier last year, when right around when it first started when we first got exposed to the COVID-19, they came in every day, and they sprayed two or three times a day. They came in with this spray, and they sprayed, but here lately, when we've been getting re-exposed, they ain't even doing that. The officers are coming in without even their protective gear on.</br></br> 

They just wear a mask. They ain't wearing a white uniforms like they normally did when it first started.
