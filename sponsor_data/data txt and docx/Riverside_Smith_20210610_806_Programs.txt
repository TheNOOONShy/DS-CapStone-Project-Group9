Caller: Well, on programming, was - we didn't have very much program at all. Now we have a little bit more program. They have a lot of us in dorm program. We're allowed to watch TV. And we're - a lot of guys are back and forth from visiting center, from the visiting area. It's a glass window visiting center.</br></br> 

And some people have – visiting center is that open. It's just for I would say over almost just a little bit less than a year it was closed. Had us, you know, on a lockdown where we were – there wasn't very much communication just, you know, with our family members at all.</br></br>

So, but, now that's back. They do have – the visiting center is open. So, like I said, it was very nice you got to think of us here in the facility while you're, you know, going to school. Hopefully in the future you won't have to go through this, you'll be a little bit more educated and you'll have, you know – but that's great that you have insight of what's going on.</br></br> 

There's a lot going on with reform the last couple of years. Reform in the jails and the prisons and, you know, with the police and just different laws. There's so many damn laws out there.</br></br>

But, I thank you very much, I do, for sending me the letter. And I just wanted to share with you what was really going on here in the jail systems. And that's really it.
