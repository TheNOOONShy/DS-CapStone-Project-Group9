This story was told by a person incarcerated at John Latorraca Correctional Center.</br></br>

UCI: And what has the COVID situation been like at your facility?</br></br>

Caller: Well, recently, they came out with all the different vaccines. So, over the last couple months, they've just been administering those to the inmates that consent to have it done. They've also, when you first get arrested, they put you - it's like anywhere from like a seven-day to two-week quarantine.</br></br>

And then, in order to get out of that holding cell, you have to have test two negative tests. Now, if you're positive, they'll eventually house you in a dorm. And then you've got to get two - I'm sorry - have two negative tests again in order to get out of that and get into the general population.</br></br>

So, I mean, a lot of people are getting the vaccine. They're safe now.</br></br>

Some people that are having it, they're pretty much quarantining them and containing it so they don't spread it to the rest of the population. It's a pretty good system. It's pretty neat to kind of watch it unfold.</br></br>

It's, I mean, like, so much chaos, though. I mean, some people have already had it, the shot. Some people just caught it. So, you can't really see it all.</br></br>

But my personal experience, I already caught it and I got two shots. I caught it when I was outside, but then I got two shots while I was in jail. So, I'm thankful that the jail was kind enough to let us get the shot so we're protected.</br></br>

UCI: That's good to know. Has your facility provided you with masks or gloves or sanitizers for protection?</br></br>

Caller: Not gloves, but when we go to court, we get masks. So I guess, I mean, you can wear them inside the jail, but inside the jail, no one really wears a mask. Unless you're that person who does, but pretty much no one wears a mask in here.</br></br>

The guards, now, the guards wear masks because they go home. And then, they're - they're likely to come across it and they could spread it to us. So, they pretty much always wear masks, which is good.</br></br>

UCI: How has visitation been in your facility?</br></br>

Caller: Here, I mean, the visitation has been really slow. And since the COVID thing, I mean, I haven't really seen any - seen or heard anybody doing visitations. Maybe it's shut down, I don't know. No one - no one has talked about it.</br></br>

Sometimes I go across the area where there's visitation. I never - I don't see people over there. And then, I mean, I think, too, most visitors would be quarantining themselves, too. And that's a pretty big area of concern.</br></br>

Now, I did talk to my attorney and I wasn't allowed - I previously have talked to my attorney like face to face in a holding cell. But that was - at least when I went, it wasn't permitted. I had to go behind the glass.</br></br>

That's kind of their policy, talk behind the window so that they can't - it doesn't, you know, so they can't transmit it from person to person. Yeah. So, all visits, if you do visit somebody, it's behind the glass. Which it's more restrictive. I don't think it's very popular, but it's better to have that than get sick.</br></br>

UCI: That is true. It's better to do that than get sick. And what have you been - how have you been coping with the crisis? Is it - has it been tough, stressful?</br></br>

Caller: I'm happy go lucky. I mean, I think it's exciting. You know, I mean, I think everyone is gonna get it, eventually, you know? Or at least, a lot of people are. And if you do get it, I mean, most people are surviving it.</br></br>

If you do get sick, I mean, you've always got the hospital to try to take care of you. And then - I mean, you don't want to think about it, but if you do pass away, you pass away. Me, personally, I'm not - I wasn't really concerned about it.</br></br>

I mean, I would take any precaution I could to not contract it and every precaution I could to be safe while having it. Not trying to give it to others and taking care of my own health. But I caught it and I personally got over it in two weeks. And I got the shot, the two step.</br></br>

So, I think that's three times I come in contact with it, I think that's what they say is pretty much, you're out of the woods at that point. So, I, personally, I mean, I'm not in the hospital, the quarantine dorms. So, it's like you only see what's on the news. If it wasn't for me seeing that, I wouldn't even be scared because you wouldn't see anything.</br></br>

You don't hear about it or see it. Me, personally. So, pretty much all I see is what's on the news as far as the hospital and the quarantine dorms. I don't see it. I mean, if somebody got sick during the day, I saw one person go out in a wheelchair.</br></br>

I mean, you don't - you don't ever follow up with what happened to that person. Could have been COVID, could have been another incident. So, I mean, yeah. I mean, as bad as it sounds and seems, it's like you don't really see - you only see numbers. Numbers on the news. So, yeah, I don't - I don't really know.</br></br>

UCI: Do you think your facility did a good job in handling the situation or do you think they could've done something better?</br></br>

Caller: I mean, actually, I think they did a pretty good job. The biggest thing was isolating people and then getting the shot. And so, they did pretty much an A plus job on that.</br></br>

Maybe they could have came a little quicker with the - with the booster shots, but I don't know. That's a policy issue, it's not really a safety issue.</br></br>

UCI: That's good to know. It's good to know that they did a pretty good job. It's good to know.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah.</br></br>

UCI: Is there anything else you want people to know about your experience?</br></br>

Caller: Anything else? Not really. Yeah, not really.</br></br>

UCI: It's good to be happy go lucky.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah - yeah, that's what I try.</br></br>

UCI: You mentioned earlier about the vaccines. What has the vaccination situation been like? Is it - do you have to sign up for it or do they give it to you?</br></br>

Caller: They've been coming by every month or two and they keep asking, you know, people that haven't had it if they want it. The first one they rolled out was the Moderna. It was a two-step, so they had to give it you, then you waited a month, got the second one.</br></br>

And now they're on to the Johnson & Johnson, and I think they've come by two, three times with - with that one. And yeah, you know. So, you know, some of the inmates want them and some of them don't.</br></br>

There are some people that denied it, and then it comes around again and then they want it again. There's people who have already got - gotten it, and now they want - now they want the booster. They want it again or a different one or something for added protection.</br></br>

They haven't done that, so. Some of the people that are - I noticed incentives work with people to get the shot. Some people that got incentives to prison, they all of a sudden will want the shot because you have to clear twice before they'll - they'll ship you out to go to prison.</br></br>

So, they figure, "Hey, if I get the shot now, I won't contract it between now and then. I'll test negative when they swab me, so then I'll get to move on with my life." So, yeah, I seen that. You hear people's political beliefs on the efficacy of the shots, any dangers, any positives or negatives.</br></br>

But it's readily available. If you want it, you can get it. Yeah. So, it's - yeah it's been pretty good. So, I can't - can't complain. They made it available, so.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, I get that. That's - that's good to know. Did you get any side effects from the vaccine?</br></br>

Caller: Actually, I did. I felt like a little sick. I don't know if it was like a fever or like weakness. I just - I didn't feel good, I didn't feel like my normal self. But it only lasted like a day.</br></br>

UCI: Did your facility help you out with that or?</br></br>

Caller: That part, no. It was pretty much just, "Suck it up."</br></br>

UCI: Do you think they should have attempted to help you out or?</br></br>

Caller: Not really because I don't think there's much they could do. That just has to - you have to ride out the course.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, just ride out the course.</br></br>

Caller: Yep.</br></br>

UCI: Is there anything - Oh, you mentioned a letter you're going to send to us.</br></br>

Caller: Yes.</br></br>

UCI: Yay. Thank you, I'm glad to hear that. We accept letters.</br></br>

Caller: Oh, good. Yeah, it's nice to write somebody so it kind of has more of a personal touch to it. It's just my thoughts. Tried to kind of sum up the experience.</br></br>

UCI: Of course. We're really grateful for that. Thank you.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah.</br></br>

UCI: And is there anything else you want people to know? Any last thoughts?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, I hope this - I hope this COVID thing, it ends sooner than later and people are able to move on from it. And are stronger because of it.</br></br>

UCI: Those are great words.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, thank you.</br></br>

UCI: No, thank you very much for calling and sharing your story. And for sending - for going to be sending a letter. Thank you.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah. I'm sorry, my experience is just from jail. So, hopefully you get other people's stories and you get to hear more about the prisons, too, how they're handling it.</br></br>

UCI: Yes. Your story is very special to us and it's very important for other people to hear about it, too.</br></br>

Caller: Oh, good.</br></br>

UCI: Thank you again for calling.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah. You're welcome. If you guys need to write me back then I'll - I'll respond.</br></br>

UCI: Of course. Thank you.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, you're welcome.</br></br>

UCI: Thank you. Have a great night.</br></br>

Caller: Bye.</br></br>

UCI: Bye.</br></br>

Caller: You, too.
