This story was told by a person incarcerated at Elmwood Correctional Facility.</br></br>

UCI: And what has the COVID situation been like at your facility?</br></br>

Caller: Well, I was supposed to know when I was gonna come out, but I had this letter now, and since November. And I just called right now, and I’m just willing to do that. So I can come out and do all the certain things I have to be doing good.</br></br>

UCI: Awesome. Another question I have is how has the vaccination situation been like at your facility?</br></br>

Caller: Oh, I got all my vaccinations. I'm vaccinated.</br></br>

UCI: Awesome.</br></br>

Caller: All my vaccinations.</br></br>

UCI: When you got them, did you feel like they gave you guys enough information, or you kind of were just offered it?</br></br>

Caller: No, when I got them, I got one just like, two days ago. In the arm.</br></br>

UCI: Oh, okay.</br></br>

Caller: And that was for the COVID. And that was to take care of the COVID problem.</br></br>

UCI: Awesome. What has it been like for you to have reduced visitation?</br></br>

Caller: Oh, for presentations?</br></br>

UCI: Oh, reduced visitations. Like visiting, visits.</br></br>

Caller: Oh yeah, I get visiting, but I haven’t got any visits from anybody, except for the ones I’ve had from you guys. From mentor.</br></br>

UCI: You mentioned visiting from us?</br></br>

Caller: Oh, just from the tablet.</br></br>

UCI: Oh, you get visits through the tablet. Did they introduce that recently, or has that kind of always been around?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah.</br></br>

UCI: Oh, okay. What has it been like for you to have reduced programming?</br></br>

Caller: Reduced programming? Well, that’d be good for me I guess. If I could reduce my programming.</br></br>

UCI: Oh, you would want more programming or less programming?</br></br>

Caller: Huh?</br></br>

UCI: Sorry. You would want more programming or less programming?</br></br>

Caller: Less programs.</br></br>

UCI: Less programs?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah.</br></br>

UCI: Oh, okay. Would you mind elaborating a little bit more on why you would want less programs?</br></br>

Caller: Less programs, yeah.</br></br>

UCI: Okay. Another question I have is how have you been coping with the COVID crisis?</br></br>

Caller: The COVID, just, I guess, the thing you’re talking about right?</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, but how have you been coping with the situation?</br></br>

Caller: Well, with the situation, with the COVID, I’ve been handling it pretty well. I mean, I’ve been sleeping during the day, I don’t mind. And waking up late - not late – not waking up late, just like, having naps, you know? Just having naps and just being awake.</br></br>

UCI: Oh awesome. That’s good. It’s definitely a good way to keep your mental health in check. Do you feel like the facility could have done anything to make the COVID situation better?</br></br>

Caller: Oh, the COVID situation? It’s something that is in the [unintelligible], and that it’s vital for anybody that’s around because they’re breathing. True?</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, definitely.</br></br>

Caller: Okay.</br></br>

UCI: Do you want to share anything else about your experience?</br></br>

Caller: No.</br></br>

UCI: No? Okay. That’s all the questions I have for you today. Yeah, thank you so much for calling.</br></br>

Caller: Okay, thanks.</br></br>

UCI: Thank you. Have a good night. Bye-bye.</br></br>

Caller: Okay.
