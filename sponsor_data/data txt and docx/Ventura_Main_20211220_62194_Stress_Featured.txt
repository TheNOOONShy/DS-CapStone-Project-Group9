UCI: What has it been like– have you been able to receive medical for your– anything besides COVID during the pandemic?</br></br> 

Caller: Yes. I’m– I’m also diagnosed with bipolar disorder so I take medicine at night to help me sleep because I have mania. You know, keeps my brain switched on. And so, the medication I take helps me switch the brain off so I can sleep.</br></br> 

But the problem is– is that we’re– we have dinner around 4:30 or 5 o’clock, and we don’t have breakfast until around 6:30 a.m. So there’s not much to– to do except watch the TV out of your cell– cell door. But they do come by every hour, to do a count. And so, I’m at the top of the stairs and they have to use a device to press it against a button that’s on the door.</br></br> 

And so they do one and eleven, which are on the end on the top level. And then there’s two and twelve ‘cause there’s twelve cells with two beds in them each. But there’s only, right now, there’s only one of us per– per cell because we are in the psych– well I'm in the psych special needs division. I have a yellow wristband.</br></br> 

And it has my booking photo on it and my name and my booking number. And then it says, [redacted]. And we have three phones and– but this particular cell block, we’re not allowed to fraternize with each other. So who’s ever out in day room, which is what it’s called it’s when you have an hour a day to– you get control of the TV.</br></br> 

So, right now, I have it on CNN and I’m seeing all about the Omicron that’s sweeping the nation and the globe. And it’s really quite saddening to see things in the news. Like the tornadoes recently and the school shootings and the– just you know? Things are just I think a little bit out of control with this pandemic.
