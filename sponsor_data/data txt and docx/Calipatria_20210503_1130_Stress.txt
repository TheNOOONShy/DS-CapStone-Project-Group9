Coping was not easy I just kept busy. Self help classes, college courses, reading and learning about stocks anything to keep my mind off of reality. Then someone close to you dies and you hear your family has caught it including your father and you feel helpless. What would you do?</br></br>
 
What could you do? That’s what I did. I prayed harder and kept my faith finally the vaccine was ready but you have to watch that because you don’t know what may actually happen to us if we take it. That is how I felt although I never caught COVID-19 I decided to take the Moderna vaccine and that was a better safe than sorry choice.</br></br>
 
Now I am getting ready to see my fiancé 15 months later and it’s a blessing. She made it. I made it we made it. This is the Third week visitation has been open and an hour isn’t long but it is worth every minute.</br></br>
 
I hear we can only hug and then no touching plus we have to test before and after the visit. I think things are starting to get better and I am still praying for other people because everyone didnt make it but I am thankful we did.</br></br>
 
To Whom it may concern stay blessed, stay positive, stay focused and dedicated. #PeaceAndBlessings #WordsAreRich
