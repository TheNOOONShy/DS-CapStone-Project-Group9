This letter was written by a person incarcerated at High Desert.</br></br>

Well now I've been in state prison for over a year. In that year alone, I've already been in three other prisons, and the one I'm currently in is the fourth one.</br></br>

Due to my kind of charge, I had trouble with cellmates that caused me to move from prison to prison. Which caused me to be very concerned for my safety.</br></br>

When I got to my current prison, I asked to be placed in single-cell status, due to the fact of what had happened in the previous prisons, not wanting to go through the hard situations I had gone through. But I got denied. I finally got blessed with a good cellmate and finally well off.
