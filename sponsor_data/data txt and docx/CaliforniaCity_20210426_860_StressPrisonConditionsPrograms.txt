For myself this is a very hard time. There are moments where you feel alone or helpless but I think of all those who are really struggling or may have lost all they have and thank God that my health is the best it's ever been. And I know that there is light at the end of the tunnel.</br></br>


Oh as medical goes they treat us fair and from what I’ve experienced the medical staff here is very attentive. Since the time of my arrest I’ve not had one problem. That goes for the C.O.s as well. I can see that this pandemic has taken a toll on all of us. I’m not one of the inmates that takes anything personal when we don’t get something or we have to do a search. It’s prison and that’s just what happens.</br></br>


We were just told that if we wear our mask and it’s not properly, we will receive a write-up. So far I know of four inmates that have received them because they did not have the mask over their nose. And it does not matter if you took the vaccine or not. I think that is b.s. because everyone, staff included has done it and still do. But hey it’s prison.</br></br>


They are still doing free phone calls twice a month now and once a month for inmates who are indigent. You receive 20 stamped envelopes for free and for that I’m thankful. I am paying for a law that I broke and all this time stuck in the cell has really affected me in so many ways. One thing I realized is life is beautiful and I’ll always cherish the time I have left.</br></br>


Never again will take freedom for granted. Well it’s time for me to end this and send it out. I hope and pray for better days for the ones that have been impacted the worst. Thank you for your time, I hope it helps. If I missed something please forgive me, take care of yourself and those around you.</br></br>
