This letter was written by a person incarcerated at CIW (California Institution for Women).</br></br>

The conditions of the cell were this. Both windows were broke out, glass was on the outside and inside of cell. The screens were pulled back allowing birds, rodents, and dirt to come into cell.</br></br>
There was black and green mold in sink and toilet. I was given three to five minutes to clean the room myself with a respiratory disease. The chemicals that were given to me was in a broken spray bottle and was told to use pads to clean with (pads) sanitary napkins.</br></br>Even though I never had a fever, I had chills, sweats, cough, shakiness, awful headaches, no taste or smell, vomiting. It took me two hours to clean the room. They did do vitals but never a doctor to listen to my lungs.</br></br>

We slept in the same bedding for the first nine days of quarantine. We were only allowed five-minute showers every other day. If they didn’t mess up on the hallways, sometimes three days. I understand the title 15 says they only have to give us showers every 72 hours, but with exception they should have allowed us to have two to five minute showers a day, two shifts.</br></br>

It takes for our families and outside agencies to call down here and fight for them to do anything naturally for us. I know we are in prison but for them not to do the same things that come natural to a human being is beyond me. We have never had any follow ups to check if there is any lasting effects.</br></br>

They now have us back on quarantine. I now live in Wilson A. We had one positive test, they removed her and put her in RC.
