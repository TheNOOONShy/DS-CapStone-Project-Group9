Dear student,</br></br>
 
Thank you for your note of concern. Being here is like being on death row. Waiting to die. I say this because they are not treating us like we should be treated. I had COVID-19 four times because they make sure you are around it. I’m 64 years old. I’m not going to die in here. I tell myself that each day. 

I’ve been locked up since 1977. I have a date for 2024. I’m not in here for killing anyone. I had 60 years for the feds and then I had 21 years for the state that I’m doing now. I should have been out 20 years ago but being Black will always hold you back. But as long as I look up, I’m going to keep getting up. 

I wish you could come in here to see how they're treating us. Everyone calls me prophet. If I wasn’t Black they wouldn’t have gave me 80 years for “bank fraud.” But it is what it is. Black people will never really matter. My mom and dad always told me my race is the human race, and I feel strongly about that today.</br></br>
 
By the way, the note was put together. I don’t think it matters if they knew I was Black beforehand. Do all the notes you send say the same thing? Because if they do, you should make them use their own words because words truly from the heart need no outside instructions. I don’t get mail so it touch my heart getting your note. In the back of my mind I don’t think I’m going to see daylight because they treat us like cattle. So with that said, I rest.</br></br>
 
Stay blessed and God will do the rest.</br></br>
