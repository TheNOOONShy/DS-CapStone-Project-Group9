That's good. There's still programs available for you guys?</br></br>Caller: Yeah. The sponsors don't come in from the - from them cities outside more because of the pandemic, but amongst ourselves we still hold, you know, self-help groups and attend them, you know, try to keep it as legit and professional as we could, you know?
