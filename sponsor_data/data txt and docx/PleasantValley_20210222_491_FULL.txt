This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Pleasant Valley.</br></br>

Hello. Thank you and your team, for the thought and concern you have shown for us that are behind these walls of the system. This prison experience has been the worst experience of my life, and the COVID-19 pandemic just mad my time in prison more difficult as it was to begin with!</br></br>

I came to prison with just about two weeks to do, and with that much time, I thought to myself, "OK" just two years to do not that bad, "OK" I can do this time and be out within two years, "piece of cake," "like a walk through the park." But then the COVID-19 pandemic hit, and my bubble of easy time was blown away or popped.</br>.</br>

It's been a positive, and a negative experience for me. I was worried about my loved ones on a daily basis out there. With limited contact, there was this period from November of 2020 to December of 2020 we went without phone calls to our loved ones. And like a whole month, we were being denied phone calls here at Pleasant Valley State Prison. Mail was drastically being delayed, and whenever I would get a letter it would be three to four weeks late or later.</br></br>

It caused a lot of stress and anger. Then all of the sudden I tested positive for COVID-19 sometime in November. I lost my taste and my smell for about two weeks, I also had a slight cough, and a little pressure on my chest. It was terrible. I was quarantined for two weeks. It was really the worst experience.</br></br>

The COVID-19 hit this prison like a major tidal wave. Everyone started getting sick from left to right, I didn't feel safe at all around anyone. I feel like all of it could have been prevented if the correctional officers, medical staff, and all other staff in this facility were properly practicing safety-ness, and properly conducting sanitation and wearing their mask.</br></br>

That's basically how it got so bad in the institution. All the chemicals that were being used at the time to clean and sanitize, the correctional officers would water it down with mostly water; I guess to save the state money or something I don't know. So basically, everything was being cleaned and sanitized with basically water, from the showers we all shared and shower in from the tables and benches we all sit at during our day room time.</br></br>

So yeah, a big part of negligence plays here on the staff and correctional officers' behalf! But there was nothing much we all could do about it. We all just had to deal and cope with it. I would just think positive thoughts, and tell myself that there's someone out there, in another state, country or somewhere in a worse, much worse predicament, than what I'm going through.</br></br>

I just knew and had faith that it would all pass soon, and everything will eventually be back to normal, which everything pretty much is by now. I got my health back, I'm in good health, I work out and exercise on a daily basis. I talk to my loved ones mostly everyday on the phone, and the best part is that I will be paroling soon.</br></br>

This COVID-19 experience also taught me how short life can really be, and how cruel life can be, and how much I take for granted. Within a blink of an eye, without a warning or anything a life can just be taken like that. So, this COVID-19 pandemic has been life-changing for me, and just makes me value my life, my freedom, my friends, and my love ones a lot more.</br></br>

Thank you for your concern and time.</br></br> 

Sincerely.
