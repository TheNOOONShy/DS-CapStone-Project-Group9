This story was told by a person incarcerated at Solano.</br></br>Caller: I want a liability, I wanted to create a liability and a paper trail.</br></br>Okay, they’re not giving us confirming documentation of the COVID positive test results.</br></br>  UCI: Mhmm.</br></br>    Caller: So, they’re just telling us that we’re positive and then they’re sending us into the, into this, environment that really potentially puts us at risk, without giving us confirmation, confirming documentation to prove that we actually have the virus. Or, and then, the doctor that they are giving us were noticing that the male nurse, on the form it’s not listing, it’s not listing the date that the positive test was rendered. So, there’s no date on it. It just says that you’re, you have received a positive COVID-19 test.
