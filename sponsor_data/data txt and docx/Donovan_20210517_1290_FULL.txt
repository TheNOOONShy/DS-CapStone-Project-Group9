Dear, </br></br>
 
My name is [redacted]. I am a 69 year old Mexican-American inmate serving a “3 strikes” sentence for assault with a deadly weapon (my hands & feet). I have been in prison 23 years now. I received your COVID-19 letter on May 12, 2021. </br></br>


Despite being susceptible to COVID-19 I have never personally worried about it, but that’s primarily due to my “gonna survive” inherit nature. I am Latino, diabetic and with high blood-pressure. Nothing was done to emphasise care for those of us with the well known susceptibilities to COVID-19, nor has anything ever been done to isolate or secure us from those less susceptible. </br></br>


I believe this to be important  because I believe the vast majority of illness and death was amongst the susceptible population. About last March of 2020 the institution started limiting activity by housing unit. We were initially given masks made out of prison jumpsuit material and no testing was going on. </br></br>


 R.J. Donovan was lucky. From early 2020 to December of 2020 there were only a very few cases found, and I can’t remember any deaths, although we did know unofficially that some, mostly elderly, people were being taken out and never returning. Also, although it seemed few cases were being found, few inmates were being tested. Staff/guards were being tested, and many positive cases were discovered among them, but inmate testing was still rare. </br></br>


Then in early/mid December of 2020 there was an explosion. For a year, almost, there were less than a handful of cases, then that December about a thousand were found, more testing? Also from zero to one death to over 15 in less than two months, maybe shorter. Also with the explosion they finally gave us “real” masks (K-95), which until they only the ___. </br></br>


Usually fights and open drug use (hypodermic) was greatly reduced. We're back to full yards now, but it was nice to have space for a while. The drugs all closed down with no visits and no cross building traffic, but it never stopped. Funny how there were no visits, but drugs and other contraband still went down. I’m  clean and sober - I changed my life over a decade ago, but in this compact environment I still see the darkness around me. </br></br>


I’m going to post your letter on the bulletin board and I hope others write you. I have no family left so I can’t express visiting issues. </br></br>


Okay, bye-bye now, any questions please feel free to write and ask. </br></br>


Good luck, </br></br>
