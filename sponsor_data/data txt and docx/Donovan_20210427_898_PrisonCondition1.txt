My safety concerns were toward the beginning C.Os were allowed to work overtime and swap shifts with C.Os on other yards. This was during  time when inmates were ordered to wear masks at all times. C.os were also reluctant to wear masks and even refused. It took several complaints from inmates before staff was ordered to wear them.</br></br>

This showed a lack of awareness and misguided rebelliousness on the part of staff. I found it frustrating how often inmates had to complain to higher ranking staff before all staff comply. As with most issues between staff and inmates, it is ten percent of the people creating 90 percent of the problems. Meaning, the majority of staff had no problem wearing masks and maintaining social distancing.</br></br>

On a personal level, a year without visits has greatly impacted me. I have had to remain at this prison because it is close to my parents, and mother had medical problems. During the year without visits, my parents had to move to Washington so my brother could help them. It was very difficult for my mother.
