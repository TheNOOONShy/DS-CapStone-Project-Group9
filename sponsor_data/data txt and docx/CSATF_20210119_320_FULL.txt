Dear PrisonPandemic Project,</br></br>

When a person is sentenced to prison, by a court, it is very similar to a contract. The court tells you how much time you must serve. The U.S. Supreme Court found that people are sent to prison, as punishment, not for punishment.</br></br>

Every sentence handed down by a court has made false contracts with prisoners. We are punished in many ways in prison, in fact, there is a very probable likelihood that we will be beaten, raped, sexually assaulted, terrorized, tortured, or killed in prison.</br></br>

The courts who sentence prisoners realize this when they make contracts, but they will never admit it or say it when sentencing a prisoner. When we are victimized in prison, 99.9 percent of us are given nothing for compensation.</br></br>

We do not get reduced sentence, we do not get any apology. In reality, prisoners are regularly subjected to punishment far beyond that given as a sentence. Prisoners suffer severe medical and mental health problems as a result of the prison systems failure to properly care for prisoners.</br></br>

I have severe cirrhosis of liver, heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, incontinence, hearing and mobility impairment as a result of “prison care”, and recently had surgery for hernia caused by being beaten by officers and other prisoners (failure to protect). Prison is a very sick place, where sick people get paid by taxpayers, to do sick things to prisoners.</br></br>

If I were guilty of the crimes I was convicted of, I would at least have a feeling of “getting my reward”, but that punishment, even if warranted, has gone way too far. When do we stop the punishment? The courts act as though I’m just sitting in here doing time, but they understand the reality and truth of how we are treated.</br></br>

I was told by the parole board that after 31 years of incarceration, I’ve failed to rehabilitate, but in truth, they have failed to give me access to rehabilitation. I have about 10 years to live, my next parole hearing is in eight.</br></br>

Fair justice should reduce sentences of inmates who have suffered victimization in prison. Prisons are not supposed to punish us! If a man is not rehabilitated by the prison after 31 years, he should be taken out of prison and placed into a place where he will receive rehabilitation. California prisons are corrupt, lies, retaliation, conspiracies, and criminals with badges.</br></br>

COVID-19: I caught COVID-19 twice, once in 2019 and then in 2020. Both times I almost died because I was thrown in a cell without care “a cold cell” (40 degrees). I believe CDCR is using COVID-19 to kill off prisoners who are old, disabled, sick because it cost them too much to maintain them financially. I recently costed them about $200,000 in 2018-2020 (medical).</br></br>

I’m 66 years old, with diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure, cirrhosis of liver (L-4), mobility/hearing impaired, incontinence. On 12/6/20 I was told I had COVID-19 and I was placed into solitary confinement without any activity, no day room/ no yard/ no showers/ no diapers/ no clothes exchange, while I have “pneumonia”. This lasted 30 days till 1/6/21.</br></br>

It was severely cold in cell with “no” heat at all. The cold cement walls were like a coffin. My legs, hands were frozen, so I could not move them very well. They said the heating was messed up, but on the day I got out of solitary confinement the heat magically came back on.</br></br>

I caught COVID-19 because nobody properly cleans anything. Nobody wears masks, the showers are filthy while over 50 prisoners a day use them. It’s impossible to practice safe distancing because many prisoners don’t wear masks, and touch meals often serving, and many are very low functioning “mentally”, and should not even be in prison, they should be in a mental facility.</br></br>

I still have pneumonia but it’s getting better no thanks to CDCR. I believe that in order for a crime to be designated as serious/violent crime, there must be medical records and financial statement to support the conviction.</br></br>

In my case there were no proof of injury (physical or financial), how does that warrant 100 years in prison, or even 20 years? My life in prison proves to me that our government are the real criminals.</br></br>

The Truth: In order to fully understand the true function of California prisons, “CDCR”, you must first understand the foundation of America, and its well-known historic criminality. What’s happening in California prisons has been going on in American government since its existence:</br></br>

1.The slaughter, and land theft against the so-called Indians.</br></br>

2. The kidnap, rape/ torture/ terrorism and slavery against the dark skin races.</br></br>

3. The criminalization of homosexuality, and the associated torture and terrorism: castration, lobotomies, chemical impotence, mental health abuse, jail and prison punishment.</br></br>

4. The criminalization of abortion.</br></br>

5. Fact: every law that has been made, has later been found defective, only after the torture and abuse involved became common knowledge to the victims and society. Why?</br></br>

6. If the foundation of a building is defective do you build on it? What will be the result? We need to destroy the corrupt foundation of America and rebuild it.</br></br>

The greed, hate, prejudice, which is the foundation of America harms so many people: the mentally ill, crime disabled, uneducated, old, and everyone who is a minority has been harmed by America’s criminality.</br></br>

The majority of rich people and middle-class feed on a corrupt system of capitalism, which is not true capitalism. When we benefit financially, by the downfall of humanity, it is dishonest and criminal.</br></br>

Our justice system cultivates and harvests criminals. Their primary objective is to feed on people. They get paid to lock people up and ensure they become hopeless causes.</br></br>

I was not lawfully locked up, I was kidnapped for ransom, by the justice system. I was given a clown for an attorney, who did nothing to help me. I’m on a ship of fools.</br></br>

I presently suffer from heart disease, high blood pressure, cirrhosis of liver, diabetes, because the prison system ignored my medical needs until my situation became severe. Because of them, I will not live in freedom, or with good health. I will die in prison within 10 years.</br></br>

The parole agency denied my parole hearing for another “eight years”. Why are all these white people doing this? The primary eyewitness in my case was blind, and that just one small part of the court abuse I was put through. Am I guilty? No.</br></br>

But even if I were, 33 years for a non-capital case, is wrong. Nobody was hurt physically or financially, yet it’s a violent/serious crime. My sentence was 123 years. I’ve seen several serial killers given parole, yet I’m violent/serious?</br></br>

I have not committed an act of injury or harm to anyone in 33 years in prison. I’ve not committed any crimes in 33 years. How am I still a danger to society? They do not get paid to let us go home. Why are all the people doing these things to me white judges/parole/police?</br></br>

The parole people said I’m not rehabilitated yet denied my rehabilitation requests, mental health care, medical care, while saying I’m not rehabilitated yet. I’m not a failure, they are! It should not take 33 years to rehabilitate a human being.</br></br>
