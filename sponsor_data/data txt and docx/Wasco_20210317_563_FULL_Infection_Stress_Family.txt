To PrisonPandemic,</br></br> 

I hope when you get this letter it find you in good health! I wanted to tell you how much this letter means to me it’s very inspiring. Thank you so much it made me smile. So you’re part of a team at UCI that awesome.</br></br> 

I would like to know what you study at UCI and maybe you could send me pictures of the school or you, it would make me smile.</br></br>
Well you ask me what my experiences inside during this time? Well let me start by saying it all began at county of [redacted], I caught COVID-19 inside the jail. People started getting sick before the President had made announcement to the country. This was on May 7, 2020 I caught COVID.</br></br> Then two county sheriff’s die that work at the jail. Then three inmate die too. I was so scared. They took me to barring for quarantine.</br></br> 

It was the worst two week of my life. I was isolation for two people would come in space suit to feed me and take my temperature every six hour.</br></br> I could sleep. I couldn’t eat. I just wonder if I would ever see my family again, my kids, my mom, and family, 'till this day I think I got PTSD. I still can’t sleep at night that just thinking of I’m going to wake up. It’s pretty frightening, or when I hear people cough my mind thinks of COVID.</br></br>There not one that goes by that I might get it again airborne.  It’s been very hard in here to cope with this pandemic. During this time in here it’s cold, ugly, and pretty sad. You have to be strong minded to cope with the situation in here.</br></br> 

I feel there no safety inside here again and airborne virus or new strain virus like COVID-19, or some more.</br></br> To have your visitation reduced to family or loved one, it hurt your heart and your mind not to see your love one or hug them or hold your kids. It takes a lot out of you physically and mentally. I think they should have therapist for people recovery from COVID or people who lost love one while incarcerated.</br></br>Inmates that have a lot of anxiety or have sleep disorder. I been coping with these crises by staying positive reading book, looking at tv, exercising, writing letter to family or friends, join church group out state or in state. By washing my hands every chance I get wearing my mask and staying six feet apart.</br></br>Like our President Mr. Biden said, so we could prevent the spread to other people. I took the Moderna vaccine in here it was two doses one month apart. Even if it’s not FDA approved I hope it make a difference cause in my mind it has.</br></br>Well God bless you. Thank you for your time. Be safe, stay home 'till further notice from the government.</br></br>

Bye, your friend.
