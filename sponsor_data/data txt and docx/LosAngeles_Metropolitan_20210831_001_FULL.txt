This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Metropolitan Detention Center.</br></br>

A big thank you for your letter and I really appreciate your time to reach out to me. The experiences in the detention center really have not been easy at all and I am happy to explain my story. I am a [redacted] national on an [redacted] visa, a treaty investor, who worked on an operation of my own business for over three years until I ran into trouble.</br></br>

I had always struggled with mental health problems all attributed to Asperger's and leading up to events such as the death of my father due to my mother killing him in 2013. I had met some very small-minded professionals who had a dirty little secret to whistle blow (snowflakes) that I sent messages with threats to them and other abuse.</br></br>

Had done so far over a year while settling in the US and unbeknownst to me FEDS investigated me for it on 12 individuals. During the time and in the pandemic, absolutely terrible, always having to wear masks with risk of being a culprit of blame if failure to do so, e.g. lock everyone down.</br></br>

My safety feels jeopardized as I can be a target of bullying and abuse by other inmates and staff. This one staff accused me of something I never did. The correction officers are anti, mean, and abusive with right wing ways to eavesdrop on privacy and summon you for stupid shit. I keep in touch with loved ones via Corrlinks on the BOP system as they live in another place.</br></br>

It has been very difficult to cope emotionally and mentally. The place is full of selfish ignorant assholes who do not understand and constantly make fun of me at 32, like being in middle school. My case is ridiculous too so very little gain on the system.</br></br>

As for COVID, quite well was vaccinated in May of this year. I hope you can see it from my perspective how bitterly right wing and overwhelming the US system is for a minor case so common but picked on by the government. Constantly feel like life isn't worth living no more. It is hard and people started turning their back on me.</br></br>

With Asperger's, alienated, and depressed, it's just absurd for these "snowflakes" rich and snobby to see me suffer just for messages online especially to women. I hate California women unfortunately for this matter. In positive at least you are fed well and go outside in programs.</br></br>

Regards.</br></br>
