This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Wasco.</br></br>

Its even hard to find someone to write or talk to because people out there are worried about the same thing your worried about. It sucks when you all of a sudden dont get any pictures or letters because everyone in the street or more worried about not catching COVID or worried about bills and other family matters so it sucks if you’re in my shoes because to tell you the truth it made me happy to get this letter because it shows someone cares because prisons reduced visiting.</br></br> 

But at the same time our people don't have the time to visit us because they don't wanna catch COVID and give it their family or they’re out trying to earn that dollar to buy supplies they need so yeah its a bitch.</br></br>

And you get people around you freaking out which makes you freak out a bit. Your celly may have bad news so you want to listen to show him there’s someone that cares.</br></br>
