This story was told by a person incarcerated at Salinas Valley.</br></br>

Caller: Got COVID-19 twice due to staff neglect here at the Salinas Valley State Prison as well as, I don't know, some other factors involved to control the COVID-19 or lack of. I will send you the article if that's okay. As I said, my name is in there and I do not mind, you know, it being there if that's alright with you.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: Cool. Alright, so moving on, I've been approached by several lawyers as well regarding COVID-19 situation because the staff here, as far as the newspaper is saying, as far as data is saying, that Salinas Valley has the highest COVID-19 cases.</br></br>

I mean, there's, it has been staff here that has died, as well as inmates here. Several inmates have died. As far as I know one of my bosses died, and as well as one of my floor officers and some more officers as well here in Salinas Valley, you know, died from the COVID-19.</br></br>

As for the shots, and, as you can hear from my voice, these are some of the ongoing aftereffects of the disease and the shots. I went - the second booster, my voice just completely went away, and its barely - are you going to ask any question on this or what?</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, that's very crazy. Did you guys get the vaccine recently?</br></br>

Caller: Vaccine recently, the one that we're talking about, COVID-19 and I got the first, I was infected initially back in September or August. The second time that I caught it was in April, February, April, somewhere around there. I was quarantined 14 days each time.</br></br>

UCI: Wow.</br></br>

Caller: I'm sorry. Yeah.</br></br>

UCI: Did you have the same symptoms both times?</br></br>

Caller: Well, as I said, you know, the second time it was worse, you know? It was worse, you know, I had things I didn't have at first. I didn't experience the chills at first, I didn't experience the loss of taste. Well I did the second time. You know, then there's other things that happened and I said as a result of the shots themselves, you know.
