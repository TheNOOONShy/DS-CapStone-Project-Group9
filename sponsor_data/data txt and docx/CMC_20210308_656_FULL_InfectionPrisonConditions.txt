Shalom:</br></br>

How did you find me? I’m so glad you did! My COVID-19 experience has been terribly bad. I could not eat or drink for 10 days.</br></br>

I went “man down” twice. I would black out, once in the restroom. Staff took my vitals and concluded that I was fine. The other time I was in the dining/chow hall. I felt as though death had come my way.</br></br>

I could not breathe, I did not want to die. Medical staff decided that it would be best to send me to the inside hospital. There I was diagnosed as having pneumocystis jiroveci, pneumonia with COVID.</br></br> 

The doctor informed me that I contracted COVID-19 on January 12, 2021. Those two illness were not good. My urine was black and orange in color. Next, I was given two IVs with no antibiotics.</br></br>

Why no antibiotics? After, I felt better. Then I was isolated for five days. When I got better, I had to beg to be released from COVID ad-segregation.</br></br>

My return to the mainline has not been very good for me. My entire body hurts all of the time, as a result of my falls. My breathing is bad when I walk short or long distances.</br></br>

I get very tired when I lay down. I get up because I am afraid that I may die while lying on my back in the bed of CDCR.</br></br> 

A lot of times during the day, I would often blackout. When I regain consciousness, I found myself not feeling very well. At night, I use personal care vaporizing chest rub on my chest and nose so that I can sleep.</br></br>

When I look back on the months of November, December, and January, I realize that the prison staff did a lot of dumb, backward moves that literally infested and contaminated the whole prison. I should have expected some foul play was going on when the warden suddenly retired. After that, the prison went haywire and out of control.</br></br>

In dosing, I am happy to be alive and breathing, I am not confined to the COVID ad-seg unit. I am happy to be able to move around at my own free will. Even though, I have to stop many times to catch my breath. I gratefully Hashem has not place on the ground again.</br></br> 

While listening to the radio, I head other inmates at San Quentin were having similar symptoms as me. That told, tells me I am not alone in the aftermath of COVID.</br></br> 

I am not sure if I will survive the next stage of COVID. Which medical and custody staff predicts is soon to come.</br></br>

Please keep in touch.</br></br>

With Shalom,</br></br>

P.S. May God continue to give you and your family good health, peace, and prosperity.</br></br>

Sincerely.
