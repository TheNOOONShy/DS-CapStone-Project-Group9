This story was told by a person incarcerated at OC Lacey. </br></br>


UCI: Okay, it is now 6:30 on April 27. And what facility are you currently housed at? </br></br>


Caller: What's the- what I'm sorry? </br></br>


UCI: What facility are you currently housed at? </br></br>


Caller: Oh like where am I at? I’m at Orange County jail.  </br></br>


UCI: Oh, okay. And what has the COVID situation been like at your facility? </br></br>


Caller: Well, I mean, it's kind of like- cuz I kinda got busted like three months before the whole pandemic started you know, so like it's been kind of like I mean, after a while, I mean, just like people out there you know, we're going crazy in here too. You know, because I mean we get- we don't get no hot meals you know? Like we get- we get sack lunches for all three meals and it's been over a year like that so it gets kind of like overwhelming you know.  </br></br>


UCI: Mhmm. </br></br>


Caller: Just recently we just got our like our visits back but it's not like fully all the way you get me it's like only like once a month. </br></br>


UCI: Are the uh- sorry?  </br></br>


Caller: It's better than nothing though, you hear me, but- </br></br>


UCI: Yeah. Are the visitations, the ones that are once a month, are those in person now at least? </br></br>


Caller: Yeah, that person there's not like like like video or to like to attend it or nothing like that. </br></br>


UCI: And how is the vaccination situation been like at your facility? </br></br>


Caller: Well, they go around, like they were actually one of the first ones to get it so they went around and they asked like certain people- I don't know how they went by it but I was one of the first ones they asked and I took the Johnson and Johnson one and uh. </br></br>


But they didn't really explain to you like like well do you want or not, you know, and I was like all right well yeah you know, cuz I mean I wanted everything to go back to normal you know, so I said yeah and but they didn’t make you sign nothing, they don't give you like no papers to explain like what exactly like does the vaccine have or like, you know, and and the other day we heard about Johnson and Johnson I don't know what’s like the big rumor about it. </br></br>


But you know, it's kind of scary like you don't even know what’s inside you, you know? Hey what you hear about the Johnson and Johnson, is it safe? </br></br>


UCI: I believe it is still safe from what I've heard. It um- I heard they're only recalling it because um, it affected like a few women. Sorry? Sorry. </br></br>


Caller: They were getting like blood clots, right? </br></br>


UCI: Yeah, I think it was like six women or something. </br></br>


Caller: Alright. </br></br>


UCI: How have you- sorry? </br></br>


Caller: I'm over here trying to ask you questions and you don’t [unintelligible] </br></br>


UCI: You can ask us if you have any questions you are welcome to ask. Um- this is basically what- whatever you feel comfortable telling us about your story. </br></br>


Caller: So, okay, so I mean, I'm alright, imma write to you guys like the full details, you know, but like a, like a brief little real quick um- So I like I said, I got busted three months before all that happened, right. And like, when they hit the Orange County jail, like it kind of like hit here before it even hit- hit like anybody like that I knew out there, you know? </br></br>


Like, none of my family had it, none of like, like, nobody that I was busted with their family had it like, the Orange County jail was one of like, the first spots that it came to you know. And just my luck, where I was at- where I was housed at the time, I’m not housed there no more, but where I was housed at, it was called b21, right? It was like a tank, like a 60 minute tank. </br></br>


And that's exactly where the guy that that contaminated the whole jail, that's where he landed, you know. I was one of the first ones to actually get it, like in the jail cuz he was in my tank, you know. So, like, from where I was at, that's where it just infected everybody, that's where it went from, like, it started there. And then it just went everywhere to like, the whole jail, you know. </br></br>


UCI: Mhmm. </br></br>


Caller: But, um, so when they did- when that happened, that guy went home, he was only here, like, for a short time, you know, for a short period of time, he went home right away. And then he infected all of us, you know, and then people started getting high fevers and, and, you know, sore throats and like, like COVID symptoms, you know, and like, they cops started coming in with like, they looked like astronauts, when they would come in, you know, like, they'll do count, but they'll be like, all suited, all face masked, and they weren't even telling us nothing. </br></br>


They weren’t telling us shit. And we’ll ask and they'll be like, I don't know if they were told not to tell us or what, you know, but that's what it seemed like, you know. </br></br>


And then after that, what happened? After that is [unintelligible] they transferred all of us out of there. They put us in a in a cell, not by ourselves, but like with another like a two man cell. And we went through the quarantine process right there. But I've been I've been on quarantine like, three times- three, four times since I've been down here. Just because like, you know, people keep getting exposed and, you know- and so forth.  </br></br>


UCI: Mhmm. </br></br>


Caller: How long it's been, it's been like a year and a half, right? </br></br>


UCI: Yeah. </br></br>


Caller: March, February?</br></br>


UCI: Yeah.</br></br>


Caller: So yeah, like this recently, like, it’s starting to get better now though. Like, cuz it’s getting better out there, it gets better in here too you know. </br></br>


UCI: Mhmm. </br></br>


Caller: They still haven’t brought the hot meals, but I heard- I mean, we've been hearing it's on the way, but we still haven't got it, but we're like getting out on quarantine, like getting exposed. Like it's getting a lot better, you know, ever since they started the vaccine.</br></br>


UCI: Have you guys had like programs reinstated?  </br></br>




Caller: Like programs like like, like what? Like school programs? </br></br>


UCI: Yeah. Any programs that were originally at your facility prior to COVID? Have they been reinstated? Or are you still waiting on those? </br></br>


Caller: No, we're still waiting on those. But they brought church back. So that's, that's a plus, you know, like they- they weren't doing that before. </br></br>


UCI: Mhmm.  </br></br>


Caller: We're slowly getting back. So that's good you know? But programs for school nah- like I get packets, but we don't turn them in or nothing, like they just send me like different packets to study and stuff like that, you know? </br></br>


UCI: Mhmm. So how have you been coping with the crisis? </br></br>


Caller: I mean, I got my days, but I just stick to a strict program, you know, like, pretty much. I'm an artist so I’ve been drawing a lot and I like working out too so. I be getting that and just working out, you know, working out and drawing and playing chess, staying busy with my celly, like you know just not let it- just not let the time do you, you gotta do the time, you know?  </br></br>


I got a good family support system too. So that's a big plus, you know? </br></br>


UCI: Yeah that’s great. How has the COVID situation affected your loved ones? </br></br>


Caller: I mean, a lot because I mean, just last month was like the first time I hadn't seen eim in a long time, you know? And, you know, I messed up the prices on the phones, but it’s still the same you know, I mean, you would think they will like at least cut em down a little bit you know what I mean.  </br></br>


Like since we couldn’t see our loved ones like we’re gonna obviously be using the phone a lot more, you know. I think the right thing to do was to like at least cut back on the on the phone price, but I mean, just it just gets it got more expensive you hear me.  </br></br>


It was already expensive, especially I’m fighting a live case so like it, you know, it gets really expensive after a while, you know, like the store and then like, you don't want to eat sack lunches all day every day. So like, so you're wasting more on commissary, you get me like, like, everything just using, like, everything just cost more, you know? </br></br>


UCI: Mhmm.  </br></br>


Caller: Uh. So. That’s pretty much it but uh. My loved ones, I mean, they're good. You know, I'm just like, well, now they're good, because we got a visit you know, but yeah, just they cost a lot more, pretty much. </br></br>


UCI: So what would- what would have made the situation at your facility better, do you think? </br></br>


Caller: Well, that, you know, like, like, like I said, the the phone thing- they should have, like, cut back on the prices. You know what I mean, like all they did, honestly, all they did was they gave us two free calls: two five minute free calls, right? Two five minute free calls each, right?  </br></br>


And you know what I mean, and those five minutes, they go by like three minutes, you know, that's once once a week, which is cool, you know, I'll take whatever I can get, you know, it’s free, you know, but that's not enough.  </br></br>


You know, I mean, and then like, with the store, they should have cut back on the prices or you know what I mean? It just got a lot more expensive, like a lot of the workflow out there slowed down, so they should have like thought about like, our families too, you hear me.  </br></br>


UCI: Mhmm.  </br></br>


Caller: I think that would’ve made it better, if they would have cut back on- on the price. </br></br>


UCI: And what else do you want people to know about your experience?</br></br>


Caller: Shit, don't get busted when, like, during a pandemic because it sucks, you know. And your court day is gonna be stretched out. Like I haven't seen a judge like in over six months. You know? I haven’t seen a judge in six months. Don't get busted if- during a pandemic, you know what I mean, like, that's the best I can tell you. </br></br>


UCI: Mhmm. </br></br>


Caller; Don’t get busted at all. I mean, haha yeah. [unintelligible] you know. </br></br>


UCI: Mhmm. </br></br>


Caller: That’s pretty much it and um- yeah, that’s it. </br></br>


UCI: Okay, and I know you mentioned that you said you'd also be writing a letter. Do you have our PO box? </br></br>


Caller: Yeah, I just got it today actually. Like, like, actually my neighbor- my neighbor got it. And then I got the letter, so yeah, I got all the info right here. </br></br>


UCI: Oh, perfect. </br></br>


Caller: [redacted]. Who is that, is that you? That’s not you, huh.</br></br>


UCI: No, that's not me. So the project is composed of both faculty and students at UCI and she is one of the faculty members.</br></br>


Caller: Okay, but I write that name when I send- the return address right? </br></br>


UCI: Yeah. </br></br>


Caller: Okay. All right. For sure.</br></br>


UCI: And was there anything else you'd like to add at all?</br></br>


Caller: Is there anything else- is it cool if- is it cool if I shout out my lady real quick or nah?</br></br>


UCI: Um, you can and then if they decide that it's not allowed, they'll just remove it so. </br></br>


Caller: Alright. Alright baby. Well is it recording right now?</br></br>
