This letter was written by a person incarcerated at SATF (California Substance Abuse Treatment Facility and State Prison).<br/><br/>

This first wave of COVID happened when SATF mixed the inmates from one yard to another. The only real safe spots are the cell living, with one inmate on E yard. Right now, I’ve been COVID free. Now I’m back on F yard where the administration has us in eight men pods with no six feet. Placing us inmates on another dangerous path. With no regret.</br></br>

The media needs to come see this first hand. It’s sad one or two inmates has a cell phone, but refused to use it for the right cause sad. Also there’s still guys in wheelchairs over 70 years old amidst us. King County courts even refused to honor the writ of habeas corpus they receive under COVID, to release anyone due to this pandemic. Again sad!</br></br>

By the grace of God I’m alive and COVID free. Even when our stimulus checks come, CDCR hold our monies for two weeks to 30 days. Also let me say CDCR was expecting us inmates to lose it for sure, some stress levels are high all over. The new year is a blessing and I’m still pushing mentally, physically, and spiritually.
