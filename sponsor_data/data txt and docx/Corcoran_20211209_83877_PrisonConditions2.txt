This story was told by a person incarcerated at Corcoran.</br></br>

Caller: And so it, yeah and so, like I said, I just feel that, for the most part, they don't - they don't put their staff under scrutiny. It’s us that go - that gets under s- that’s under scrutiny. And right now, from what I understand, you know, the staff, their union, they're fighting to not be enforced to take the vaccine.</br></br>

UCI: Yep.</br></br>

Caller: They're going back and forth, you know, they're going back and forth in court about that, because it's their free choice, even though they're state employees, you know, and they're sworn officers. They’re sworn to protect and serve.</br></br>

UCI: Exactly.</br></br>

Caller: And by protecting us, who are under their custody.</br></br>

UCI: Yep.</br></br>

Caller: To protect, you know, they should be tested more often than they, than they are now because the last time I had inquired about how, how often the staff are tested, I was told that it’s approximately about a week. They’re - every week.</br></br>

UCI: Jeez.</br></br>

Caller: And - and in one week- I mean, so much can happen in one week.</br></br>

UCI: No, totally.</br></br>

Caller: You know, they can come in and bring the - bring the vir- you know? And in one week that’s really, that’s - that's - I don’t think that’s often enough.</br></br>

UCI: Not at all. And, yeah, it’s ridiculous like you said, if they’re in charge of people and the safety of other people then in - I mean, to me, in my personal opinion.</br></br>

Caller: Right.</br></br>

UCI: I don’t think it should be a question about that 'cause it’s like you signed up for the job, like this is what your job is, you know what I mean?
