This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Tracy. </br></br>
The way I’ve been coping with the crisis is by praying, meditating on the words of the Bible. Journaling, attending services, and exercising along with watching sports. My days are dark because I don’t have a significant other to vent to. Nor can I be the sounding board for what God is doing in this wicked and perverse generation.
