This story was told by a person incarcerated at San Quentin.</br></br>-

Caller: It was hard. It was really hard. And it was intense.</br></br>

And I think that discovering that now too with a lot of people on the streets that have had COVID is that there is anxiety, there is a dimension to it that is not just physical. That you know, and I'm still feeling fatigued at times. I'm still feeling my smell isn't back.</br></br>

And taste is okay. Pretty good, I think. Some things taste great, you know, so I guess I guess it's there.</br></br>

But, you know, weakness, imbalance. Sometimes I'll just all of a sudden feel like I have no- my equilibrium just shifts, and then it comes back. So I don't know if that's that or I'm just getting old or whatever, but I have to think that it's from that too.</br></br>

And so it's- it's- it's got some long-term effects to it.
