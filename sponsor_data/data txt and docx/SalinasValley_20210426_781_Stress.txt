This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Salinas Valley.</br></br>

My cellmate received a letter from one of your pupils about your PrisonPandemic project. Well, long story short, he didn’t want to participate. But, I feel like OUR stories deserve to be told. Also! Going to say, I would love to be a part of you all’s project.</br></br>

I love to write and tell stories! I’ve been in prison now for ten years, June 2021. Have been in and out of correctional facilities since I was very young. I come from a fucked up childhood! Drug addicted parents, gangs, pimps, prostitutes, the whole nine, and I would love to share my story! Not only about me, but what COVID-19 has done to us here on the inside.</br></br>

I first wanted to run it by you first professor, share a little about me, and let you know that I am not a bad person solely by being in prison! But, if possible, could you forward this enclosed short story of COVID-19 in prison. And if [redacted] is up to it, assist me in developing an autobiography on myself. Thank you! Maybe she can get a few extra credits!</br></br>

I write poetry, music, rap/R&B/pop. I sing, draw, do electrical work, masonry work, almost anything! Just need something to do, to occupy my time.
