The CO just handed me your letter, a few minutes ago. Wish you could have been present to see me ecstatic! I'm happy. He pass it to me and then I smiled. For real for real. You say I'm in your thoughts and so thanks for remembering me. Being in your thoughts, it's good.</br></br>

Thanks for thinking about the kid. Yes, I'm hoping everyone gets through this pandemic as well. So you take good care of yourself. Because the wait is almost over. We'll get through this together. It has been difficult. However, I stay busy, and work hard. Such as focusing on an education, writing, listening to music, and I work five days out of the week. And also, I love to work out. I grew sum. lol.</br></br>

My cousin had a baby. She sent me a few pictures. She's beautiful and her eyes are blue. My safety is good. It's been hard not being able to see my love ones. Nevertheless, I speak to them and make sure their end is all good. So, they are doing good. But also, my family wants everything to return back to normal too you know. They're in good health and we'll see each other soon.</br></br>

Are you from Stockton, CA? Do you have any siblings? And also, how are you dealing with this pandemic? Raised in the bay-area in a small town called East Palo Alto. I am the baby, the youngest and I have two brothers and one sister. She writes letters to me, we communicate. It's a pleasure to be in touch and be able to speak to each other.</br></br>

Talk to me. I'll be vigilant for your letters and/or cards. You're more than welcome to correspond with me. Sunday to Monday, hahaha... You feel me! You missed me or what? I think I missed you may more honestly.</br></br>

Yours truly.
