My experience with COVID-19 pandemic.</br></br>

I’ve been incarcerated for 29 years and this is the first time in my life that I’ve experienced physically the effects of this horrible virus. On December 15, 2020, I tested positive for COVID-19, called SARS-CoV-2. I was moved to an isolation area for 14 days.</br></br>

For the grace of God, the virus didn’t do any damage to my health. I personally believe that being inside during this pandemic has been very stressful, a deep sense of despair, and feeling helpless. I can’t be there with my loved ones. Also hearing the Governor of California is once again suggesting the possibility of having a stay home policy due to the increase of the virus.</br></br>

And this leads one to ask the question, what is really happening these days? But overall I feel that CDCR is doing a great job in keeping us safe from the virus. All of us in here are doing our part to stop the spread. It has been very hard not being able to see our families and loved ones (contact visits).</br></br> 

But for now we understand that we have to work together to stop this pandemic. I want to personally thank the director/division of adult institutions for providing us with video visiting, which is making it so easy for us to stay in touch with our families.</br></br>

Now, in response to how I’ve been coping with this crisis? During this time of the pandemic, I’ve been reading my bible, writing family, friends and our struggling youth out there. Maybe by doing this I can avoid the darkness and despair that so many people have succumbed to during these days. By taking time to pray and be with God is giving me the strength to believe in the path of Jesus and to transform my life.</br></br>

I want to take this opportunity and share some insights that I have learned from the previous year. As you and I know, the news of 2020 has been dominated by fear, grief, and stress.</br></br>

As you can imagine, 2020 has brought unprecedented challenges to communities everywhere. Although it may seem like centuries ago, 2020 year began with raging wildfires in Australia and the tensions of the Trump impeachment process in the US. China faced the first detected case of the virus now named COVID-19. By March, much of the world had entered lockdown and term COVID-19 as a global pandemic.</br></br> 

Wildfires raged across California, people took to the streets to protest stark racial inequities as we have seen with Black Lives Matter (BLM) and more. However, in prison, I have learned many insights that helped me stay optimistic about someday being free from a life sentence and being emotionally well. In prison, I used to think of it as an isolating experience but that all changed when I started to go to self-help groups and learned it is free time.</br></br>

Free time meant I had opportunities to make a list of activities I wanted to participate in. I read books, had my workout routines, “spreads” meals that I ate with friends on the weekends or during sports games on television. I also had time to build relationships with friends and loved ones outside the prison walls. I even had the opportunity to develop new friendships with others.</br></br>

I do remember the time during lockdowns or lockups where I would fall down that road and think “why is this happening?” or “why me?” That was how I landed in worse circumstances with the “stinking thinking” term that is used in self-help. I did learn to look at my challenges in life and see that if I created short-term and long-term goals, I would have something to concentrate on.</br></br>

In this new year, I am reminded that is normal to feel upset and aware that we are in challenging times. In the bigger picture, I am encouraged to ponder on things I value and want to pursue in my life. I seize this moment as a practice of staying focus and safe and knowing that I can thrive in any circumstance that I encounter.</br></br>

We all know that life will never be the same after this pandemic. This will be a very unsettling experience, just as it was for me. But there are others who will see this time, this pandemic, as an opportunity. The crisis can offer us new ways of seeing, new ways of acting, and new ways of creating better relationships.</br></br>

It will not be easy, and there could be much uncertainty, suffering and pain. But either we believe that something else is being born (going through a pandemic), either we believe there is hope, or we remain in doubt that any good can come from discipline and following the way of the path, the way of Jesus.</br></br>

In conclusion, as I go back to my normal programming and life in here, I'll go back to the usual and be reminded of what's important to me, and how I can contribute to my new-found insights during the pandemic to improve relationships and better my community on the yard and doing creative things.</br></br> 

I want to thank you for giving me the chance to share my experiences with UCI team. Thank you for your kind words and for everything UCI is doing to help reform the prison system. I'm happy to share with you that I've been granted a chance to get my life sentence vacated (under SB1437) waiting to be sent to LA county in a couple of months for an evidentiary hearing. God is good. I've been reflecting that at the end of this pandemic period, I will be able to see the light at the end of the tunnel and that one day I will be able to be with my family.</br></br>

Hope is a powerful force that will bring you through any storm. Our hope is in God, therefore, we can hope without any natural reason to do so. Hope is a positive expectation of good.</br></br>

Something that I do almost every day is say, “something good is going to happen to me today, and something good is going to happen through me today.”  I want to encourage you to get into the habit of experiencing good things in your life. After all, God is good. And he wants to shower his goodness on you (see Isaiah 30:18).</br></br>

Today is the day to start believing for your breakthrough! And I believe one of the best things you can do while you're expecting and waiting for God to move in your own life is to look for ways to reach out and help others. Reading your message it seems to me that you and your team are making it your business to regularly encourage those around you and us to meet our needs as you are able to. And I'm sure you'll end up receiving more joy and peace than you had before, and you’ll give others a reason to hope too.</br></br>

Blessing and peace.
