This story was told by a person incarcerated at Colusa County Jail.</br></br>

UCI: And how would you describe the COVID situation at your facility?</br></br>

Caller: So I at the current, so currently I am in Colusa County, but I came from the [redacted] county and [redacted] county. Do you want me just touch base on this county?</br></br>

UCI: Whatever you're comfortable with sharing. If you’d like to compare them, you’re more than welcome to or talk about other ones. Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: Okay, so in [redacted] we have to do our COVID tests right when we get in there, and then we quarantine for 14 days, even though the tests comes back negative. When an outbreak was in the county, they locked us all into our own cell and we were tested everyday, and we were also taken our temperature and our vitals. And they used sanitization after everyone would go out and use the phone or use the shower.</br></br>

Here in Colusa, none of that is available. I know it's like, you know, tax dollars aren’t supposed to be paying for that kind of stuff, but we don't have any sanitizer in our rooms or our housing whatsoever.</br></br>

There is no mandate to wear the masks. They are not masks that are supposed to be worn due, like what the news says. So they’re just like, not the masks that are, obviously, I don't know how to say it. But anyways, sorry, I got distracted. </br></br>

There’s like no, there’s no sanitation going while walking through. There was an outbreak in the Colusa County Jail and they were still delivering trays of food from each sector. So even though somebody might’ve tested positive for COVID and they were turned away, it was still in, the virus was still in here.</br></br>

When it happened in [redacted] county, there was girls that were testing positive and they were keeping them in the same module. So they’re still using the same phones as well as the same showers, and there was no sanitation done and there was no testing as well.</br></br> 

So in [redacted] county, if there's an outbreak, you weren't getting your vitals and quarantined or anything of the sort. Oh, and they do offer the COVID vaccine, however, in [redacted] county and as well as in Colusa County, you can get the vaccine.</br></br>

UCI: And does that mean any brand does it and they offer a second dosage or a booster by any chance?</br></br>

Caller: They offer the booster in [redacted] and the first and second dose and then here, I believe you have to do it in three visits. So they do it all individually.</br></br>

UCI: Okay thank you. And then thank you so much for comparing all of them, that's really helpful.</br></br>

Caller: Sorry.</br></br>

UCI: No, no, thank you. It’s much appreciated. What has visitation looked like in each of those for you?</br></br>

Caller: Oh, so this is what's really bad. So visitation in [redacted] or in [redacted] is moved to IWA visits. So our family members have to pay every time they visit us for 30 minutes. And I believe it's like, I don't know if it's illegal, but [redacted] county doesn’t offer visiting at all.</br></br>

There’s no visitation at all. So girls are in there for months, and some girls have been there for the entire time of COVID and have not seen their family members at all. And there’s innocent ones in there, you know?</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>

Caller: Here at Colusa, we’re able to see our family members through the glass. So, however, when we’re in visitation there’s three to four people in visitation and we are mandated to wear our masks and I'm not sure if it's well kept to sanitize before and after we leave the room or not. And then our visitors have to wear their masks, obviously, inside the facility and we’re allowed to have those kinds of visits.</br></br>

Like I said, [redacted] has cut off visits completely because they don’t want to have people interacting, coming in and out, without having, you know, the COVID-19 shots or not wearing the right masks or whatever.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah.</br></br>

UCI: And then, do you know how each facility would handle if somebody tested positive?</br></br>

Caller: So I’ve heard, so someone was showing symptoms here and they put them in a max cell, like a cell by themselves away from general population, and they checked on them and monitored them. I've heard rumors that when they come in and if they test positive, they turn them away, and have to return when they aren't showing the symptoms.</br></br>

Like I said, in [redacted] county they have the women in the same dorms, so they’re in their own rooms, their own cell. But they are still using the same eating area, phone area, tv, showers, and they’re allowed out 20 minutes a day to come out for 20 minutes a day to shower, and to use the phones and then go back to their rooms, not being tested. So we’re not constantly being tested in [redacted], and they’re not constantly testing.</br></br>

In [redacted], one girl caught COVID, this was back in 2020 or 2021, sorry, and what happened was she caught COVID. She was one of the trustees, one of the workers. She was passing out the trays like to lunch and dinner.</br></br> 

And they were still allowing the other three workers that were exposed to her, obviously, working side by side with her, to work in the facility or work with the other, you know, inmates. Taking them, you know, and later that week somebody else became COVID positive.</br></br>

They then removed the girl from the main dorm and put her into medical. However, they took probably about seven hours to move her from her dorm to medical. They did sanitize everything. However, they allowed this girl to talk while she was leaving the dorm without her mask on, putting her germs everywhere. And I don't think the inmates knew how serious that COVID really was at that point or how people were really, you know.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>

Caller: I guess they weren't taking it as serious as it should have been taken. But I'm not sure. I don't, I mean, but there were quite a few outbreaks in this county jail.</br></br>

UCI: Well, this has been a lot of great information. Thank you so much. Is there anything else you'd like to share about your COVID situation tonight?</br></br> 

Caller: No, that's it.
