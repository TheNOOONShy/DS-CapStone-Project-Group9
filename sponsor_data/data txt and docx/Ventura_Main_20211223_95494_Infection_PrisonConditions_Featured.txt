This story was told by a person incarcerated at Ventura County Main Jail.</br></br>

Caller: And then, they started doing this isolation thing, which is like 14 days of lockdown and then — and then, you get to go to like a regular section floor. Like people are like —there’s no more lockdown, you know? Like, it’s because of COVID, the isolation [unintelligible].</br></br>

UCI: Okay. That makes sense.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah. And then — and then so I went through all that already and then, like, I don’t know. It’s so — I was in like a — like a regular dorm and then, like, I already went through all that. And then, they ended up testing everyone or something for COVID and I guess they — I don’t know. I guess my test results were like, I don’t know.</br></br>

I’m still waiting to find out but they ended up moving me from the main — from like the main, what is it, section and they put me in this little like dorm right now. And I’m in here for — they saying that I might have COVID, I don’t know. And they’re saying that for 14 to 21 days again, I’m on lockdown in this little like medical kind of dorm.</br></br> 

UCI: Oh, that’s definitely scary. How do you feel about all of this?</br></br>

Caller: I don’t know. I think it’s crazy. I don’t know because I don’t know, I hope I don't have — like I asked them today. Like, why did they move me out of my section, you know?</br></br>

And they're like because they just did the test. So, they were like buccal swabs and I'm guessing it’s because of that. But then when I asked them, they were like, “Oh we haven't got your results back.”</br></br>

But why would they move me over here like, you know? Unless I was dirty, you know? Like my results were dirty, you know? But, so now I’m over here in this little dorm room. Everybody — there's like one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine — there’s only ten cells and I guess everyone in here is — supposedly has COVID, I don’t know.</br></br>

But, it’s like — it’s really nasty in here, I don’t know. It’s like dirty and stuff and they only let us like, I don’t know. We’re only allowed to come out every other day to shower. It’s just disgusting in here, I don’t know. This shit sucks, yeah.</br></br>

UCI: I’m so sorry to hear that. Previous to the situation you’re in right now, did the facility offer any vaccination for anybody?</br></br>

Caller: Oh, yeah. They did, actually. So they — so like out of nowhere, they told me like, “Do you want a vaccination?” And I told them, “Yeah.” And they gave me the one Moderna shot. It’s like the — there’s two of them, I guess.</br></br>

And they only gave me one. But, yeah. So I was supposed to get the other one, but I never got it.
