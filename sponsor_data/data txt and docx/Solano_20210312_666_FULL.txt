This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Solano.</br></br>Dear PrisonPandemic,</br></br>I am currently an inmate at CSP-Solano. I heard about PrisonPandemic from a peer of mines and read that you are interested in stories that are related to inmate experiences during the pandemic. I wish to contribute with this story I am about to share with you pertaining to my personal experience of the COVID-19 pandemic while being incarcerated.</br></br>I hope that it will support you in your goal to positively change reforms that would benefit the people who are affected by incarceration which includes loved ones, volunteers, staff, and the community as a whole.</br></br>I would like to request a copy of the story I send, be sent back to me. Thank you for your efforts in giving people like me, who in moments believe we have lost our voices, to be heard.</br></br>Mid-March while working at my job, I was told to return back to the building I am housed in. The entire yard was recalled. I was told by my boss that when we would come back was uncertain.</br></br>“Uncertain” was the word I lived with in the past year. With that word, for me, came fear. Like myself, those around me also expressed their anxiety with this “uncertainty” in their own unique way. My own fear was related to a multitude of thoughts that began to flow through my mind.</br></br>At one point, I thought “Was this the implosion and revival of a new world?” These thoughts were fleeting at best but nonetheless they were present. When the visit I had scheduled for the weekend was cancelled, it hit home for me.</br></br>I began to wonder when I would see my friends and family again. That visit room was where our connections came alive. In the visit room was where I genuinely felt joy and also the despair and pain of watching those I love leave. For me, that was a unique experience that I cherish, one of both pleasantness and unpleasantness.</br></br>As time went by, I did my best to stay productive. I formed bonds with people that I never had before. Our relationship blossomed and I felt such gratitude for the support of my peers. Whether they knew it or not, they were crucial elements to me walking through the pandemic with optimism.</br></br>Relationship is something I have always valued. During the pandemic, it became more prominent than ever. With the time and choice to watch television more each day, I watched as the world I lived in began to fall apart at the seams. I began to ponder if this was only occurring in the media that I saw.</br></br>I began to conversate with family and friends from outside the walls, and they told me a similar story. Fear was alive in so many people and the inability to sit with the fear was demonstrated by people’s choices and actions. It pained me to see the hate, greed, and ignorance that was boiling in our society.</br></br>This is not to say that I did not see the counter products of each of these as well. I saw moments of kindness, generosity, and wisdom. They were few on the media but they were present.</br></br>I decided to shift my energy elsewhere, because watching the news became an emotional rollercoaster ending mostly in anger. Anger arose from the thoughts I had of injustice, judgment of our political system, and thoughts of morals. For me, there was a lack of compassion, connection, empathy, recognition, and community.</br></br>I diverted my energy to my personal life and my own personal relationships. This took the form of those I interacted with on a daily basis and the few phone calls I would make.</br></br>I was fortunate enough to have a support network who wished to share with me about their own experiences of COVID-19 pandemic and who were open to listening to my struggles. Yet, I still yearned to see their faces and not have to be limited by a 15-minute phone call.</br></br>
Sure, I can always call back, but there will be a distaste for me to have to wait and call back. Many times, I would be in a passionate conversation only to hear, “You have 60 seconds left.” With that warning, I wanted to tie up the conversation as neatly as I can because I didn’t know when I will be able to call back.</br></br>Sometime it could be a few minutes but sometime it could be hours. The time in between drains the passion that was alive in that moment. To me, it will never be the same as an actual visit where those conversations can last hours.</br></br>For me, a conversation is more than the words spoken. It is the connection that is shared between the parties together. For myself, it is the body language displayed, the words, the tone, the gentle facial expressions, and even more the food that we share as a son, brother, cousin, partner, friends, and just as human beings.</br></br>During this pandemic being incarcerated, I made conscious choices to connect with people around me because it offered me what I desired. I signed up with mental health to see a license clinical social worker, which I am grateful that the prison system offers. This was a place that I felt safe to talk and express my stressors during this time.</br></br>What was bothering me most during this time that I sought help was the loneliness I was experiencing. There was a emptiness and void inside me that I was looking to fill. It was not everyday, but occurred sporadically throughout the year. I was experiencing irrational thoughts that led to great fear and pain.</br></br>When friends or family did not pick up, I began to think the worse. I first asked if they were okay (health wise), then I wondered if they had abandoned me. These thoughts ruminated. I expressed this to the person I was working with in mental health.</br></br>I walked away from our first session with a quote that rang so true to me. “Loneliness is not being alone, but being surrounded by the wrong people.” I was gravitating to people around me just in attempt to fill that void. But, I still felt empty inside and at times I felt exhausted of the conversations.</br></br>Fortune would have it that I made a genuine connection with someone that would light the passion and companionship I desired. This occurred after I tested positive for COVID-19 and was moved to the gym for quarantine. At first, I was fearful of testing positive.</br></br>I did not want to be placed in isolation because of the comfort I experienced at my current spot. I was also just starting to form a relationship with a friend, who now I consider close. I watched as names were called off a list and people packed up their things to go to quarantine. As I watched, loneliness set in once again.</br></br>The building I was in had become vacant. It was eerie to wake up and see such an empty place that was once so lively. I told the nurse I had symptoms of COVID-19, where only a few months ago I would have kept that to myself. I told her I wanted to go to quarantine.</br></br>Everyone that I shared a connection with at this point was gone. I was one of the last group to be quarantined. When my name was announced the next day to be quarantined, I jumped up with joy.</br></br>Thinking back, I can chuckle at what occurred. I would have rather experienced COVID-19 than to experience the loneliness. This probably had to do with the fact that my symptoms of COVID-19 were quite mild.</br></br>My symptoms included lost of taste and smell. The world was definitely less beautiful without those senses but I was still grateful that I was not ill. Moving into the gym for quarantine was a blessing for me as well. I was bunked up with a friend who I had just been developing a relationship with.</br></br>As I brought my property in, he immediately expressed his hospitality and care. I am not sure how I would have handled that horrendous living situation without his kindness and friendship. Over the next 10 days we shared meals, conversated, and lived together. It brought us closer as friends and allowed me to see his values because he was living by them.</br></br>I also got to appreciate those who volunteered to clean and provide service in the gym. And that is still not enough credit for them because the gym was filthy and a terrible place to house those positive with COVID-19, at least by my opinion. The ceiling near my bunk was dripping water and crumbs would descend on those underneath it.</br></br>The showers ran cold on various times of the day. The urinals were clogged most of the time. But what was worse was that people were jammed in there like sardines. My neighbor was no more than three feet away from me.</br></br>In the gym, I saw a variety of symptoms from those who had none to those who looked like they were on their death bed. Because of the crowded space, it was hard to tell who needed help and who did not.</br></br>What was even more saddening was to hear officers talk about how there was nothing to stop the virus and that everyone was going to get it eventually. This sparked anger in me because I valued life and health. If this was the case then why take all the preventative measures, at least that was my thought as anger rised.</br></br>While in quarantine, medical staff took vitals twice a day. I appreciated their efforts and service and expressed it as so.</br></br>What I did not agree with was when people requested electrolyte drinks when they were dehydrated, that they needed to turn in a medical slip to get it. Which would occasionally take days to be processed. If I am in quarantine and I am requesting treatment, give it to me rather than telling me to go through the process that requires days.</br></br>The living environment was horrendous during quarantine, but the people who were offering their support made me experience ease. When I left quarantine, I was placed back in the same building I came from. This was fortunate because it was not so for some other people.</br></br>
Others experienced being shuffled around until finally after a month or so being returned back to their original building. For me, the discomfort and fortune melded together. I was placed on a bunk that was not supposed to house any inmate, but once again, I was housed with my friend who I had been housed with in the gym.</br></br>The next three weeks, I was waiting to be moved, and at times, felt like my needs were not being heard by the officers. Where I did feel heard was with my peers in the new dorm. They continuously reassured me that I was being moved. It was once again three weeks of uncertainty, which was manageable thanks to my peers.</br></br>Uncertainty is something that I am working with continuously. What has made life in these times of unknown more joyful is the support I receive and the ability to accept the world as it continues to unveil itself to me.</br></br>This is no way condemning CDCR and the health department for their efforts. Their efforts are valued, but I believe there is a more efficient and healthier logistic and care that could have been provided.</br></br>I understand that no one can be prepared for this pandemic that hit the entire world by surprise. Yet, I can’t help but think if we as a race of human beings began treating each other with compassion and empathy, could the suffering have been lessened?</br></br>Those thoughts are unique to myself and it is how I have viewed this time of pandemic. Like a coin, there is always two sides, and a possibility of meeting in the middle, no matter how unlikely those odds are. If we strive with effort and mindfulness, the journey is what will hopefully meet the needs of the people.
