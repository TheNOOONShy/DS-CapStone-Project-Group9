This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Chino.</br></br>

As I entered the "hospital" room, I immediately noted the absence of any soap, toothbrush, toothpowder, or a state cup to drink from. The C.O. ([redacted]) refused to provide them, locked the door, and walked away. It was 3 days before I was able to obtain a piece of soap to wash with, and 5 days after I got a toothbrush.</br></br>  

I asked for, was promised, but never received a disposable razor. Because I didn't have a cup, and the sink faucet was too narrow to reach with my mouth, and I HAD to drink to keep my B.P. up, or die, I had to use my cupped hands to get water - AFTER having had to use the toilet. Showers are only provided once per week. No other opportunity is given to keep clean.</br></br> 

The prison doesn't contact your emergency contact to let them know your condition. My first day in the prison clinic, I received letters from my family/friends asking why they hadn't heard from me since April. They were worried about me and had heard CIM was hard hit with COVID-19, and would I please let them know how I was doing.</br></br>  

I asked for pen/paper/envelopes, provided even prisoners in detention as punishment for rules violation and was ignored. About a week after entering the prison's "hospital", I was finally able to make a 10 minute call to my brother, letting him know I was still alive. After 5 days, I withdrew my consent for further “treatment” in the prison's "hospital". I was ignored.</br></br> 

In the prison's "hospital" you are alone in a barren room for 23 1/2 hours each day. I spent 12 days with nothing to read, no one to talk to, no way to write anyone. The highlight of each day was the 15 minutes each morning and evening when the nurses take your vitals. As to those vitals, I was very observant of my 02 readings, as they were my ticket OUT of this hell.</br></br> 

The last several days I noted readings of 93 percent, 94 percent, 95 percent. I didn't believe the nurses were recording them properly, so I asked the doctor what the readings were for the previous days. He indicated readings almost 3 to 4 percent points HIGHER, and noted I'd be “out" soon. (I have no idea what/why/how the medical staff reached the stats they recorded. They obviously made them up as needed, but I wasn't complaining, I just wanted out.)</br></br> 

Shortly before being judged "recovered", the prison doctor mentioned ALL the other buildings on "A" Yard were quarantined with infected inmates, and I would be sent to "C" Yard, instead. The doctor stated the design of "A" Yard dorms only were safe for housing either ALL recovered, or ALL infected, as everyone would be sharing the same "herd" characteristics.</br></br> 

My old dorm, A5, had been the first infected, and thus the first "recovered", and had been designated a "COVID Recovered" dorm for older inmates. My bed there was given however, which is why I am now on "C" Yard, despite such unit being exactly fitting my needs.</br></br> 

I am currently appealing for my return to A5, where I would be housed among others with similar COVID resistance - though I have little faith this will occur. I should never have been removed from that unit, as I invoked my right to refuse further "treatment" before my bed space and paid job assignment were given to others.</br></br> 

I would like to return to where my special skills and disciplinary-free programming enabled me to make positive contributions and receive the appreciation of my work supervisors. In a system rife with indifference, it would be refreshing to see some of the aforementioned problems addressed.</br></br> 

A social worker in the institution's "hospital" could once a day easily ensure patients have basic hygiene items, ways to contact their families, or a simple book to read. It's not difficult. I pray someone will respond to my story.</br></br>
