This story was told by a person incarcerated at Vacaville.</br></br>

UCI: So how was the, has there been any distribution of the vaccine? Has there been any sort of process, has it improved at all, has it worsened? Describe like the situation, everything.</br></br> 

Caller: I got both shots and then still got corona, COVID-19 and recently I got the booster shot.</br></br>

UCI: Did you get your booster shot recently?</br></br> 

Caller: Yes.</br></br>

UCI: Mmkay. I just wanted - I just wanted to get the full grasp on it, but continue, I'm sorry for interrupting you.</br></br>

Caller: Yes, and, you know, just like I tell you, it's hard. You just sitting there, just wondering what's going to happen. 'Cause like I said, I thought I was a goner 'cause I couldn't breathe that good, and then through everything I'm going through, my chemo.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah.</br></br> 

Caller: You know, I still got cancer, I'm still in the infirmary at the hospital, and hopefully next month I get the tumor cut out.</br></br>

UCI: Good, okay. I'm so sorry to hear that you're struggling with all these mental, with all these health problems. But continue I'm sorry for interrupting you.</br></br> 

Caller: Yeah, and I talk to one of the deputies here and one of them had, they got COVID-19 twice. And I go, "Wow, twice," and he said, "Yeah." And then my son he got it too, and his wife and his daughter. It's kind of hard just sitting here and not doing, not doing, you know, I thought there would be a medication or something like that but no. There's no medication for it here.</br></br>

UCI: So you mention your son, how has you being incarcerated during COVID impacted them?</br></br>

Caller: Well, you know, it hurts them. 'Cause I'm away from them, you know, hoping I'll be out there soon.
