Prison and the pandemic is very big here. </br></br>

Hi my name is [redacted]. My story about Coronavirus in my life caused a great impact because I’ve had Coronavirus for one month already and it is very hard. The first couple of days when one gets the Coronavirus; you can't smell, you lose your sense of taste and your whole body hurts. </br></br>
And yet there are still a lot of people that don’t believe in the Coronavirus and that’s why a lot of people get infected. </br></br>
Well, I thank God very much because I feel better already. It was only two days that were very complicated for me but there have been some fellow prisoners who did get very sick due to the Coronavirus. </br></br>
The ones who suffer the most due to the pandemic inside the prisons are us the prisoner because we can't have visitors, nor go to the store for our food, nor take classes, or attend our programs to reduce our sentence. </br></br>
The only good thing about the Coronavirus is that it does not see skin color. White or brown or any other race, there is no difference in the skin color of people. To the Coronavirus we are all equal. </br></br>
And this is my story about everything we are experiencing inside the prisons. That’s whys I’d like to ask everyone to stay safe from the Coronavirus because they need to take care of themselves first before they can take care of others. </br></br>
And we can't go to church either, but I thank you all for thinking of us who have no voice about anything. May God bless you all. Amen </br></br>
A lot of people get infected everyday inside the prisons.
