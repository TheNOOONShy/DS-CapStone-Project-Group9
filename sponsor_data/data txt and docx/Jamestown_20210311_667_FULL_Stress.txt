This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Jamestown.</br></br>

Thank you for taking out your time to send me a letter. And yes, it really has been hard this last year. The pandemic has made my mind racing all over the place. From my family, my kids, and myself.</br></br> 

Are we going to make it through this? And my prayers go out to everyone we lost.</br></br>

As far as being locked up during all of this, yes, it’s been difficult living day to day. Not knowing what’s going to happen next. Just yesterday a whole dorm got moved off the yard because someone in that dorm was sick. Now everybody in that dorm is in the hole again, four week quarantine. It’s situations like that that makes our time harder.</br></br>

Social distancing is impossible here. Everybody has a bunkie so if he gets sick, you’ll get sick. And mail is so backed up, it takes a month to get a letter. Phone calls are once a week.</br></br> 

No contact visits.</br></br>

You gotta stay strong, mentally. A few times I thought about giving up. But I could never do that to my kids. I got four daughters.</br></br> 

I gotta keep pushing for them.</br></br>

I got so much on my mind I could write about. How about you just keep in touch, then we’ll get to know each other. I have a Facebook you can check out. For a visual, and support.</br></br>

Hope to hear back from you soon.</br></br>

Take care, God bless you and your family.
