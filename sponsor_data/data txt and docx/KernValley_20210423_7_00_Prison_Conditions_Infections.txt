UCI: What has the COVID situation been like at your facility?</br></br>

Caller: I would say at first it was like- it was like everywhere, you know. It was pretty much a toss up. Nobody knew you know, what- what was the proper condition and the proper you know, maintenance of the whole issue and you know. We were given masks and we had to wear them when we come from one of our cells and you know, however, you know.</br></br>
When we go cell call or whatever, we still have to drink out of the same drinks. Well, not the same drinks, get our water from the cup. From the same water faucet and- and you know. The food situation. Everybody pretty much has had it around here.</br></br>
I had COVID I think in January? Maybe in January. Well you know it was, it was just- you know- nobody could get a handle on it. You know, finally it was the week we’ve gotten the vaccination, most of us has. It’s pretty much under control but you- you know in the beginning of it all, there really was, you know.</br></br>
I guess it was ground zero for everything you know, for everybody around here. It was- it was just a new experience and you know, finally they- they were sanitizing the showers after we took a shower. The phones, after each phone calls they were sanitizing them. But you know that’s a couple months, it took a couple months to get to that stage in this situation.</br></br>
It was- at first it was like. There was no program. There was no program, nobody could come out. Nothing. You know? They were scared for, for themselves. You know, the officers and the administration and you know, for the inmates I guess as well too. You know, they don’t want us inmates having no contact but you know now, things are a lot better.</br></br>
Things are a lot better and a lot of news. You know, inmates have pretty much a strong new system that has to do with each other. Bacteria, living in close- close quarters anyway so. Majority of us here, in this prison, I think like three people have died in this prison. Maybe, um shoot.</br></br>
I think at least like 90% of the population in here has had it. And you know- we, we have still have like the after effects like coughing at night. Like right as before I’m about to fall asleep. You know, I’m like a little, you know a little slower. Like in my workouts and stuff. But you know I got both of the vaccinations and they- they’re pretty good at that spot on, 28 days later.</br></br>
They give you the second one and for me like that vaccination was worse than the actual having COVID. You know, it wasn’t that bad it was like a mild flu, when I had it. But you know, still. We were allowed, they tested us maybe the first. At first, two to three weeks, two weeks. They tested us like every week.</br></br>
You know, they want to make sure nobody bringing it in and that was a good thing. But as anything, it slipped through and you know, it cell. Cell by cell, section by section, they were sending a lot of us in different blocks. There were quarantine blocks on every yard and, you know. They kept us separate when we tested but at first you know kind of making us tested afterwards, we were like “Nah” I’m- we’re not going to test you know because they were going to move us. I mean, we made it difficult as well.</br></br>
I’m not- I’m not going to share COVID. When I had COVID I didn’t know. It was- I couldn’t taste, I couldn’t- I had a light fever. But it was, we’re recuperating- most of us are recuperating from it. Right here, right now.</br></br>I’m not- I’m not going to share COVID. When I had COVID I didn’t know. It was- I couldn’t taste, I couldn’t- I had a light fever.
