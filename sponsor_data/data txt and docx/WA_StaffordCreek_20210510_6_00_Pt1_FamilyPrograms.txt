This story was told by a person incarcerated at Washington State Stafford Creek.</br></br>


UCI: So, I know that you said that they're starting education and work again. Are you guys allowed to have visitors, or are they still not allowing you to have family visits?</br></br>


Caller: They actually-. Man, what day was it supposed to start? This month. I can't remember, it's coming up real quick. They're starting in-person visits again but it's no contact, your visitors have to go to the Washington DOC website and schedule a time slot and it's only one hour once a month, but no contact.</br></br>


UCI: Mhm.</br></br>


Caller: They have like flashing lights-. Right now, I'm on the phone, they got these big plastic dividers in between all the phones, you know, to keep like a social distancing partition. And that's the same thing you're gonna have out in the visiting.</br></br>


UCI: Mhm. So, how has it been for you to not have visitation with your family or loved ones?</br></br>


Caller: Oh, it sucks. I mean, before this happened my girlfriend was coming to see me for a year and a half. She was up here once a week and she drives two hours each way — so it's a four hour round trip. And then, like the last six months or so before this happened, she started coming up twice a month just to save a little money because it was so expensive. And then, all of a sudden this happened.</br></br>


Like, I'm at the tail end of a long ass sentence and being able to have those visits, and talk about the plans for when I get out, you know, and everything is-. And another thing that's really messed me up on it is they have-. Well, they're supposed to have release readiness classes that you're eligible for when you get 18 months short, as I've said, I've been down over 27 years.</br></br>


The world has completely changed, I've never seen the internet, I had a pager when I got locked up, I've never used a cell phone, you know? I don't have a clue of the world that I'm getting ready to go into. And I can't even get assistance right now writing a resume. I've never had a resume in my life, so this pandemic is just totally knocked out all my ability to get skills for a successful entry into society.</br></br>


UCI: Mhm, have they said anything about if they're going to start back that release readiness program or is that still just not mentioned at all?</br></br>


Caller: I don't know. They're just passing it back. I've understood as much as I've got a Senator that I'm in correspondence with right now and she's even contacted- reached out, contacted DOC liaison, they told her that somebody would be getting with-. I mean, right now they-. Well, I don't want to give too much information, but they've allowed me time in a computer lab, you know to be able to try to work on my resume, but the problem is, I don't have a clue what I'm doing.</br></br>


UCI: Mhm.</br></br>


Caller: I mean, it's great. Yeah, there's Microsoft Word, there's a template, click on it. But what am I supposed to do with it? I don't even know what the end result is supposed to look like or anything else.</br></br>


UCI: Uh huh.</br></br>


Caller: I know that sounds crazy, but you know, when you've been locked up almost three decades that's what happens.</br></br>


UCI: No, it completely makes sense, I understand what you're saying that you'd be having difficulties making one when they're not helping you with it.</br></br>


Caller: Yeah, I've never had a bank account, I've never had a credit card, I have-. I don't have good credit or bad credit, I don't exist.</br></br>


UCI: Mhm.</br></br>


Caller: You know, I'm just a ghost that's getting ready to come back out in the world.
