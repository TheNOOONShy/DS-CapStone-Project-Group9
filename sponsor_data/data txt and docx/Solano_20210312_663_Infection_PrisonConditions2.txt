This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Solano.</br></br>

People were being moved all over this prison. We can see we we’re be housed with non-affected people. We voiced our concerns to medical and custody, our voices and concerns went unheard. We even on occasion saw a newly arrival inmate go into a building.</br></br>

I turned in several medical 7362 forms about COVID side effects that I’ve been experiencing. I received priority DUCAT on January 19, 2021, never was seen. I received two priority DUCATs on January 24, 2021, never was seen.</br></br>

I was then put on the critical worker list for PIA in January 2021. I informed all staff at my job of my COVID symptoms that I have been experiencing. I was recommended to see my doctor to get a lay-in. I could not get the lay-in because my doctor is refusing to see me. So, I worked while I was feeling all of these symptoms.</br></br>

On January 28, 2021, I was moved to another building which was quarantined at the time. I turned in another medical 7362 form on February 2, 2021. I received a priority DUCAT. Was seen by a nurse, who came to the building and told me that all my symptoms will all go away over time.</br></br> 

I turned in several more medical 7362 forms which were never responded to.</br></br>

On February 12, 2021, I was moved to another building which was quarantined at the time. On February 16, 2021, I was called up to the correctional officer’s podium who told me that he is on the phone with a unknown nurse asking him to ask me if I am still having difficulty breathing. I said yes, she told the officers that I need to go “man down.”</br></br>

I said that I’m not going to do that because that’s why I turned in the medical forms. I then to tell her that I need to see my doctor. That’s when the officer told me she said it’s no longer on her, it is on me, because she told me to go “man down.”</br></br>

On March 3, 2021, I received a priority DUCAT to see my primary care physician. My regular doctor was not there. I was seen by a doctor via television. I believe he was a outside doctor because of the way he treated me.</br></br>

He asked about all my symptoms. I told him of everything that I’ve been experiencing. The doctor said he ordered blood tests, which I did and waiting for the results. He ordered a EKG, which I did and waiting for the results.</br></br>

He also ordered x-rays to be taken of my lungs and he said he is going to some kind of scan of my head. I just got a priority DUCAT that says x-rays for March 12, 2021. I also need to add that he wrote down priority to get vaccine shot. To this date I still have not received it.</br></br>

On March 10, 2021, the nurses came in the building with a list of people that they said needs to swab. I refused. I guess my 90 days that the medical says I’m resolved just got finished. I’m done cooperating with this medical when it comes to me being punished for a positive test!
