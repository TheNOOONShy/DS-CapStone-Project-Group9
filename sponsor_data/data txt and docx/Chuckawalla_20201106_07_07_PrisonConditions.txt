This story was told by a person incarcerated at Chuckawalla.</br></br>

Caller: They're - they're making me go to work during this pandemic.</br></br>And I work in the kitchen. And what happened was - is that they - they wrote me up because I refused to go in to work, and they wrote me a 115 for not coming into work. And they said I refused to work, but I never refused to work. It's I told them that I didn't want to put my life in danger because I'm a diabetic. And while that happened, it's - it's a lot of people that kept getting sick in the other buildings and they were working in the kitchen, too.</br></br>So now we're - they have three buildings on this yard at this time, and one is already down, and those are kitchen workers that got sick. So right now, I'm trying to fight this 115 and they found me guilty on it because they said I refused to work. But I never refused to work. I only refused to put my life in danger. And pretty much, that's what's going on here right now. And like right now, all they have two - two buildings, one on another yard and one on this yard, that's locked down for quarantine.</br></br>And, like, four people already died on the other yard. It's - it's kind of - it's kind of crazy right now because they trying to make us go to - keep going to work, and I - I really don't want to go in there, but I don't want to get another writeup because I'm a lifer and it - it will make me where I won't go home. So, you know, that - well, pretty much that's the story for me. Thank you for listening to me.
