This story was told by a person incarcerated at Theo Lacy.</br></br>

Caller: It’s been very different. Very different, not….</br></br>

UCI: You said it’s been very different?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, it’s, it’s very different from what we're used to. Definitely. Do you wanna- you want- I guess I’ll answer your specific questions if you have any.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, I was just, like, you can more sort of explain, like, why is it more very different?</br></br>

Caller: Okay. Well, obviously, because of social distancing, and, I mean, it's just not what I'm used to. The crowd is very, like, minimized. I'm in a building that normally houses 208 men, and I think we have 60, maybe 80 people here? I didn't count exactly, but I know that we- wait, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten- yeah, we have maybe- maybe 70 to 80 people here. Which is obviously downsized tremendously.</br></br>

The one positive thing about what's been going on with COVID, and also what's going on- what's going on upstate, is that the different races that normally butt heads, we all- we all been getting along. There's been less violence because of- more or less because of the things going on upstate. If you want me to get into that specifically, I can.<br></br>

But as far as COVID-19, we have to go to- go into a quarantine when we first get here. For some reason- 14 days is supposed to be the minimum time in quarantine. Some people stay there only 14 days. Some people stay there for over 60 days for some reason. I-I don't know why. But I've heard stories from other inmates. Not because they've caught COVID-19 or anything, I- for some reason they get lost in the mix somewhere. Not really sure why. Is that kind of what you're looking for?</br></br>

UCI: Yeah. So, um, since people have been getting vaccinated, like, how has the vaccination situation been up there?</br></br>

Caller: There's a big- you know, there's- some people here are, um, I don't know if they're superstitious or if they're just listening to the wrong people. There seems to be less willingness of inmates to get vaccinations versus, it seems like more anti versus more pro, if that makes sense.</br></br>

I don't know if it has anything to do with education, or socio-economic backgrounds, but most people seem to just listen to whoever their big homie is or, you know, their elder, so to speak. And if someone who holds some juice in their race, you know, is anti-vaccination, then pretty much almost the whole car is anti-vaccination. Know what I mean by car?</br></br>

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: Okay, good. So that individual race would be anti-vaccination for the most part because of that.</br></br>

UCI: Okay. And so how would you say this- you've been coping with the crisis?</br></br>

Caller: I'm sorry, could you repeat that question?</br></br>

UCI: How would you say- How have you been coping with the crisis of COVID-19?</br></br>

Caller: You know, honestly, it's been a blessing for me in disguise, only because I've done a lot of time in the last couple of years. I’m fighting a drug addiction. You know, obviously, I'm clean right now, but it seems like when I catch time, they always let me out earlier because of COVID. A lot of people are getting out a lot sooner than they expect.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: One time I got out six and a half months early, because of COVID-19 restrictions and regulations, I guess.</br></br>

UCI: Okay, that's good.</br></br>

Caller: But I’ll tell you, I haven’t- I haven’t had any symptoms. I didn't really take it seriously at first. But I saw some people get sick, I saw a couple people die. And so then I took a little more serious, and, um…but yeah, it's definitely affected us in both positive and negative ways, you know. Some people, some people appreciate life a lot more, and some people just try to take advantage of, you know, what's been going on in negative ways as well, so.</br></br>

UCI: Mhm. So, since COVID is everywhere, how has the COVID situation at your facility affected your loved ones?</br></br>

Caller: Affected my- I'm sorry, my what?</br></br>

UCI: Your loved ones?</br></br>

Caller: Oh, I personally don't know anyone close to me that has caught COVID. But we have friends of my family members that have caught it and have passed. So, I mean, y’know, thank the Lord, none of my immediate family members have had any issues, nor I. But yeah, so I haven't been directly affected by it as far as family members. But as far as my environment, yeah, of course I've been affected. But yeah, I haven't experienced that.</br></br>

UCI: Okay. And do you have any, like, recommendations to make the situation better at your facility?</br></br>

Caller: Um, not really. I'm actually pretty impressed with the California Department of Corrections, and the sheriff's department. They’re really taking a lot of precautions. Normally, situations where, I mean, they've really- they've really tried to work with us, you know, to keep us happy while putting us under a bunch of restrictions. I actually don't- I don't have any complaints, honestly, for these people.</br></br>

I mean, suggestions- only suggestion I would probably have is- because we're inside a facility, we only get outdoor time, sometimes twice a week. You know, one hour out, and it's very early in the morning, sometimes six, seven in the morning, and some people don't want to get up, you know. I mean, I would suggest maybe a couple of times where we can actually go outside. And the- I mean, if we’re gonna practice social distancing, outdoors would be, we just need to be able to get outdoors and be in the sun, like they allow upstate. In the county, they don't really get to get outside like they do in state prison.</br></br>

But yeah, I mean, my suggestion would be to allow us to go outside maybe at different times of the day, not just early in the morning, and maybe more than twice a week. Because A, it will promote physical exercise, which obviously, we all need, and B, we’ll be out in the- you know, it'd be- social distancing would be much easier outdoors, obviously. I think.</br></br>

UCI: Mhm, that’s good. That's good to know. So is there anything else you'd like people to know about your experience?</br></br>

Caller: Um, well, that’s pretty much- not really, no. I don't know, I guess I can't really think of- you know, without getting into all the things that go on upstate, yeah, in the county jail things are definitely different. I can't really- it's just less crowded. It seems to be much more friendly, because it's less crowded. There's a lot of less- turns out the racial tension is very minimal, if any, I think because of the less crowded situation.</br></br>

And I don't know. Even the deputies are all- they don't mess with us like they used to. They used to really harass us and give us a hard time in a lot of scenarios I could go into, but since this pandemic, they seem to have all been on Midol, you know? If that makes any sense. They're all- they're all very laid back and friendly and cooperative and…fair. Fair is a very good word. Much more fair than in the past. And- I don’t know. They seem to actually have a heart.</br></br>

UCI: Well, that's very good to hear. Well, I had a pleasure speaking with you today. Thank you very much for participating in PrisonPandemic. Please consider telling your friends about us, and see if they would like to call in.</br></br>

Caller: Okay. Alright. Thank you.</br></br>

UCI: Thank you. Have a good night.</br></br>

Caller: You too. Bye bye.
