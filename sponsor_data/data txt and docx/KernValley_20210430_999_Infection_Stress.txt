This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Kern Valley.</br></br>The vaccination process was quick here. Being African descent, I really had to convince my black and brown brothers why it was so important for us to get the vaccine. Most of them don’t watch the news. I got them into that so they could see first-hand how COVID was revisiting our communities of color!</br></br>I see the pandemic from two points, a religious one which is the outcome of man’s refusal to adhere to God’s law through corruption, tyranny, greed, etc. The other due to man’s destruction of the planet and environment which brought on all the plagues we’ve faced the past 20 years or so. From droughts, famine, climate change, damage to the eco-system, etc.</br></br>Each of these issues are spoken on in great detail throughout the “Qur’an” so it comes as no surprise to me as to what we’re facing right now! I’m submitting a poem I wrote last year as the virus took off. I write my poem under these names, I put the date I wrote each poem after my name. Take care I appreciate the work you and your students have done, may Allah guide and protect you all!</br></br>Na’Alaikum As-Salaam and peace be upon you!
