Luckily, I have experienced the pandemic on the streets and then was arrested during the middle of it. I remember the long lines to get into stores, the masks being worn, the toilet paper and paper towel sellouts, the empty store shelves, the lack of traffic throughout the day! No hair cuts, spas, or massages. It was an unusual time.</br></br>

The pandemic affected us inside jail as well. We all, especially staff, wear face masks. They provide hand sanitizer for use, extra soap, and disinfectant throughout the day.</br></br>

I was actually caught in the cell with someone who was infected, we were initially tested and taken. Our entire cell was moved to quarantine. Smaller cells and fewer people helped ease the situation.</br></br>

Visiting started two weeks ago today and I was fortunate to have one. It is difficult and stressing to worry about your family and have only min to communicate with them.</br></br>

The lack of hot meals is a disappointment. We are hoping it comes back soon. The workers stopped working at one point. They are all back to work now.</br></br>

All in all, we are in good spirits and hope for the best. The vaccine has been a great help as we are all eagerly await the end of the pandemic.</br></br> 

Thanks for reaching out!
