<em>This story was told by a person incarcerated at Robert Presley Detention Center.</br></br></em>

UCI: So, how are you today? I'm sorry, I believe I asked you.</br></br>

Caller: I'm well.</br></br>

UCI: You're well, okay. And what facility are you currently housed at?</br></br>

Caller: I'm sorry?</br></br>

UCI: What facility are you currently housed at?</br></br>

Caller: Robert Presley Detention Center, Riverside.</br></br>

UCI: Okay, and what has the COVID situation been like at your facility?</br></br>

Caller: It's not good.</br></br>

UCI: How is it not good?</br></br>

Caller: Several people came up positive. They never quarantined us. When new arrivals come in from the basement you have folks who make it through intake and are never tested, they just send them straight in to the general population.</br></br>

UCI: Mh-hmm. And so it has been spreading that way?</br></br>

Caller: It has.</br></br>

UCI: Okay, and now that a vaccination has become available how has that situation been like at your facility?</br></br>

Caller: Probably half and half. Half - Probably half of the people here responded to it. Half of us, I'm one of them, I just don't trust it therefore I refuse to take it.</br></br>

UCI: Mh-hmm. And so, but they have been offering it?</br></br>

Caller: They have.</br></br>

UCI: Okay, and, like, what has it been like for you to have reduced visitation and programming?</br></br>

Caller: Our visits were just recently restored. Because my parents are seniors and they're at a higher risk they still refuse to come inside the jail. Just for their own safety, and I understand that.</br></br>

UCI: Mh-hmm. So, how have you been coping with the crisis?</br></br>

Caller: Well, last year I was found positive at another institution. Myself and probably over 120 other inmates are currently involved in a civil suit against Riverside County for being infected inside the jail. During that time a sergeant informed my whole pod, that the whole pod was infected. And in fact, several weeks later soon the whole floor was infected.</br></br> 

During that time they moved us around like musical chairs. They even at one time put me in the pod with people who were sicker than I was. And all I was ever offered was a basic cold set up. My symptoms were achy bones, runny nose, headaches, that sort of thing, but I saw other people who were in a lot worse conditions. 

Some people were bedridden and couldn't even get out of bed to eat. So, it was a scary time because when we first found out that we were positive we all took it as a death sentence. And all we saw when we turned on the news was people dying all over the country. So, it was not a good time.</br></br>

UCI: Mh-hmm. So, what could you say could make the situation at your facility better?</br></br>

Caller: Well, of course testing. They could have a better vetting system for new arrivals as well as the staff. Because, you know, staff go home and come back every day and we've already â€“ we have documented instances where staff has been known to come into the institution with the virus. So, certainly more testing and just a better vetting system for new arrivals when they come into the jail.</br></br>

UCI: Yes, so, what else did you want the people to know about your experience in regards to COVID-19?</br></br>

Caller: I don't know, I guess I really haven't thought about that. When I got the letter I wanted to call and say something as well as send a return letter and thank everybody for just even being concerned. There not a lot of staff inside the jails who really care about inmates, so just to see folks on the outside who are actively involved and, you know, checking up on us and making sure that we surviving here, it's a good thing.</br></br>

UCI: Mh-hmm. Okay, well that's all for me today. I thank you so much for calling in and telling your story. You can feel free to write us or call any other time if there's any more information you'd like to tell. Please consider telling your friends about us and seeing if they'd like to call in at any time.</br></br>

Caller: Okay, thank you.</br></br>

UCI: Thank you. Have a good night.
