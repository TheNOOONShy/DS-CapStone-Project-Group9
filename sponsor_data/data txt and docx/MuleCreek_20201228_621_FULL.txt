This story was told by a person incarcerated at Mule Creek.</br></br>

UCI: What's going on with COVID-19 at your facility?</br></br>

Caller:	Okay, I'm kind of nervous right now, so excuse me. I'm calling on behalf of all of the inmates here. I just was found positive for COVID-19, and I was taken out of my housing unit and put in this gym that houses 100-plus guys, which it was a deplorable.</br></br>

No cleaning supplies, no, you can't socially distance yourself. There's people everywhere. There's so many health violations that is going on in here. They have these porta potties that they don't even clean regularly. A shower every three days actually like I'm in ad seg like I'd done something wrong. In the whole 16 days that I was in here, I only got two showers.</br></br>

UCI: Wow.</br></br>

Caller:	They never gave out. They gave me three masks in the 16 days that I was there, and we were supposed to get a clean mask every day. There's so many different fire hazards in there. People are sleeping by the doors and all that. Let me see, I wrote down little notes.</br></br>

UCI: Oh, yeah.</br></br>

Caller:	I never received my, when you become positive for COVID-19, you are supposed to get vitamin C and zinc and stuff like that. Never received it. There's a handful of us that never received those pills. There's officers and staff admittedly coming to work having COVID and that they're not reporting it.</br></br>

The bathroom that is inside of the gym, you're not supposed to, you're only supposed to stand up and use it. But people have to use the restroom, and they shut down the porta potty at 9:00. So, you will have to use that bathroom. So, there was, like, 15 people at 3:12 in the morning trying to use the restroom because there's so many people using the bathroom all throughout the day, older guys, young guys.</br></br>

They have two sinks, three total, but one is in that bathroom I told you about. But there are two sinks that everybody uses to not only get drinking water but brush their teeth and wash their clothes. There is no fresh linen at all. What they were doing to us, it was just horrible.</br></br>

UCI: Wow. Do you mind stating what facility you're in?</br></br>

Caller:	Mule Creek.</br></br>

UCI: If it's not too much of a problem, would you mind describing the timeline? Since the start of the pandemic to now, what have you gone through? What's changed in the prison?</br></br>

Caller: Their handling of it is just horrible. Even when they find somebody positive, the inmate is just running around for four or five days. They tested me on a Thursday, and they didn't take me until three or four days later. So, I was like spreading it. Finally, when they started moving people, they took you out of your cells, told you to leave all your personal property in your cell, and then they'll move you away to another yard, A yard, B yard.</br></br>

And they're still doing it. They're moving people everywhere. And your personal property was just left there, and they have some other inmate come pack your stuff. So, now people have got property missing. Fortunately, I took all of my property with me. But I've seen it. I've seen people that are missing stuff.</br></br>

It's 66 people in each pod. Nobody's in there, just their personal property, because they moved them all. They put them on level four because they have a building down there for quarantine, instead of just locking us in the cell. It was freezing cold in that damn gym. I'm talking about just it's crazy. And they've got this shower that it looks like a trailer, and you only can use it every three days. The hot water runs out because there's so many people. So, you've got to go outside in the cold to take a cold shower.</br></br>

UCI: Wow.</br></br>

Caller:	There's so many people in there right now that's pissed off, and they're trying to figure out a way to get heard. They're violating our rights.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah. Is that the general consensus?</br></br>

Caller: They have cots, metal bunks, some metal bunks, and the majority of these fold-out cots, a lot of the cots are broken. A lot of the cots are broken. They've got like rips down the middle. They was moving people in constantly that was sick, and there's no more cots for them.</br></br>

So, they're just standing around with their property until the cops go get more cots. And we tell them, "Where are you going to put them? We're supposed to be six feet. You've got dudes head to toe in here."</br></br>

UCI: So, it's been, the gym specifically, has been overcrowded the entire time?</br></br>

Caller: Yes, and it's right now the same way. I just left on the 27th, and it's like that right now. They gave us, the staff and the COs, they gave us this COVID because we can't go nowhere, but yet you punish us. You take our program. You do all this stuff. But you can come to work with it? We can't go to work. They took my job from me.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah. You said you described it as punishment. Does it feel that way?</br></br>

Caller: It's just like a punishment. We can barely go to yard. We get yard three times a week, and it's only for a few hours. You can't have dayroom. They want you to stay in a cell. You only can have showers and phones and microwave. Why people can't come out and stretch their legs? You're only giving us so much yard a week.</br></br>

UCI: What's that?</br></br>

Caller:	I don't understand it but -</br></br>

UCI: Oh, but what's that doing to, that sounds really difficult. How are people coping? How are you coping with all of this?</br></br>

Caller: For the most part, I try to work out and stay positive if I can, because I know not everyone is doing this intentionally. But it's almost like they are forgetting that we're human beings by the way that they're going about it. They're not trying to get our opinion on how to go about this because we have to deal with it. They come and go.</br></br>

UCI: When you say "they" or "the people," who are you, are you talking about CDCR?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, the CDC, the people that controls all this. Now, they're giving options to take the COVID test. They didn't give us options before.</br></br>

UCI: So, can you volunteer for that?</br></br>

Caller:	Yeah. They're saying you can sign a refusal. Before, they would threaten you. And I'm close to going to the board. I can't get a write-up. I can't afford a write-up. And plus, it's COVID. I'm like, "Okay, I can't smell. I can't taste. I've got this blinding headache. Let me go get tested. I feel like I've got symptoms."</br></br>

So, I tried to do the right thing, and I feel like I got punished. Not only did they, I'm in some other place now because they took me out of the gym. But I'm in some other place now that this is not originally where I was at.</br></br>

UCI: Do you feel like a lot of people have been shuffled around like that, even beyond just going to the gym and what not, and people are getting rehoused?</br></br>

Caller: Right. They've been putting people in level four. They've got a whole building over there just for quarantine, and people are going over there. They're going to B yard, C yard, the gyms. They're even turning a building up here into COVID overflow. And what's so crazy about it, the people in the building got to have regular showers every day and stuff like that, but we didn't.</br></br>

People in that gym are living in filth. There's no way to clean your sheets. There's no way to clean your clothes. If you get lucky like I did, I brought my own stuff, my own [unintelligible]. But sharing with all the dudes that asked me, I ran out.</br></br>

UCI: So, you were helping the other guys out in the gym?</br></br>

Caller:	Right. I gave them everything I had. I had my own bucket, so I let them use my bucket to wash their clothes in, so they didn't have to wash their clothes inside of a nasty sink that people brush their teeth, wash their clothes, and get drinking water out of.</br></br>

UCI: It kind of sounds like you guys are doing more for one another than anyone else at this point. You think that sounds right?</br></br>

Caller:	Right, right. We try to band together and help each other out the best way we can. Older guys that have got walkers and wheelchairs, we'd help them get to their bunk the best we can. Give them a bunk that's not a cot, because they were saying if you've got a cot, you don't get a mattress, which is crazy because everybody brought their mattress. So, now you're taking people's mattresses.</br></br>

UCI: Oh, wow.</br></br>

Caller:	Yeah. They came in saying, "If you sleep on a cot, we're taking your mattress."</br></br>

UCI: With the time that's left, is there anything that you want the people on the outside to know?</br></br>

Caller:	Just if they can send somebody, if you guys can get somebody to come in here and see this, specifically the gym, you would see what I'm talking about. It's dirty.
