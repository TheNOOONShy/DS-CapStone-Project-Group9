Hello reader,</br></br>About my covid-19 experience in prison. Well it’s been troubling for me and every other inmate to earn educational good-time credit off of our sentences. Why, because COVID-19 has affected us in those matters.</br></br>

I actually caught COVID-19 along with a couple of other hundred inmates on the yard, yet we all recovered =-). The Doctors and nurses are really attentive here in S.A.T.F. so I wasn’t too worried about access to the resources that are available.</br></br>

I don’t get visits so I dealt with that like a surfer in the wave. I been coping with the crisis fine but I truly wish it was all over.</br></br>Best Wishes,</br></br>
