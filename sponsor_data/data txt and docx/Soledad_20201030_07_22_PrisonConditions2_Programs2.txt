This story was told by a person incarcerated at Soledad.</br></br>

Caller: The only other program is canteen and packages. They offered us an extra package because you can only get four a year, but your family goes online to - there’s like four major corporations, which your family can go online, or they have a catalog that they send you. And you can order off your trust account what you need from the package.</br></br> 

The packages can buy your television, your fan, your hot pot. Because everything that you have in your cell, your personal property, you buy, they don’t give anything to you other than state clothes to wear, like jeans, and a shirt, and a pair of shoes.</br></br> 

Tennis shoes, sweats, thermals, soap, coffee, deodorant, toothpaste, everything you buy, you purchase. Either you purchase from the store here, they call it commissary or canteen, and you go by the last two of your number, your CDC number. There’s three times, they call them three draws or draw sequences.</br></br> 

And you need to have people deposit money. If you have restitution, half of that money goes to restitution. So, if you send $100 in, a guy only gets $45. You send $200 in, he only gets $90.</br></br> 

The maximum you can spend in canteen is $220 a month, so most of the money is coming from the street. Same with the packages, they do that by pounds. You can get a 35 - 30-pound package, but your family has to pay, like, say, somebody like Amazon, to get the stuff.</br></br> 

So, basically, for an inmate to survive in here, he’s got to have family members that are sending him a couple hundred dollars every couple of months because the only thing that’s free. They give you food, but the meals are like kid meals, you know, all these guys are grown men, you know, 200-220 pounds, six feet tall, I mean.
