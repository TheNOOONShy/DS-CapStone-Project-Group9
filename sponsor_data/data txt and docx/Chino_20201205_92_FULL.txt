This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Chino.</br></br>

I’m at the CDCR facility in Chino, level two, senior yard, and I understand you are interested in first-hand data during the C-virus modification of programs. I am 67, Air Force veteran in very good health since this started last year. </br></br>

We live in long four upper/lower beds three to five feet apart on the sides. The outer rows of 10 to 12 beds have screened windows that open to the outside. Shortly after the pandemic, orders were sent down to take every third bed out of service, the logic of which doesn’t play out due to our proximity standing in lines for chow, utilizing the restroom/showers located midway between the 50 bed groups. </br></br>

If you Google Earth 14901 S. Central Ave, Chino, our eight dorm layout can be seen with a 'tent city’ of 12 eight-man tents in the center with portable AC/heating units, shower trailers and restrooms for those who tested positive in the last nine months, but mostly not showing any symptoms.</br></br>

There are a few related topics I would like to include briefly. If additional information is desired, please send a note.</br></br>

The isolation issue has been frustrating. While every third bed was taken out of service, the wall-mounted 48” oscillating fans at each end of the dorm room during the warmer months would blow coughs and sneezes half way down the dorm, from either end. In addition to that, these buildings from the 40s house inmates who are taking ‘hot meds,’ which makes them sensitive to warmer temperatures. </br></br>

The rooftop exhaust fan designed to remove the radiated heat from the dorm has been non-operational since February. We went through three record heat waves this past summer. When it’s 120 outside, it’s 115 in here. And with 75 bodies on each side, the heat lasts into the evening with no negative or positive pressure.</br></br>

I’m certified since 1974 in commercial HVAC. When I sent a friendly informal letter to the AW of operations, who I spoke with previously, the letter was intercepted. I was called in front of the Captain who made it clear I should go through the chain of command for work orders, which a survey will reveal do not get generated.</br></br>

When this ‘crisis’ first got underway, groups of five to 20 people would be called all of a sudden to move to another building, out to the tents, or to another yard. When this happens, a loss of acquired property takes place. Social interactions are broken up like musicians, educational mentors, craft projects, and of course the addicts and their suppliers. The stress of sudden movement, unnecessary loss of property, social reintegration in new areas creates cortisol in older people which diminishes the immune system, the very function the objective is to protect. A lot of arbitrary moves and money spending took place. </br></br>

The company testing the swabs, Quest Labs, is known for false positives. My ‘bunkie’ and assistant for the repair shop was moved to the tents in March. Neither of us has displayed any symptoms. He gets air conditioning, I get 115 degrees. </br></br>

Ironically, the heat med inmates remain in the building, outside of ASHRA 64 building codes. When the rooftop exhaust fan was fixed last December, the hot-shot worker put a motor in two to three times the RPM rating. When it started up, the pulley would squeal on the belt. The motor would overheat due to the torque mismatch, and shut down after 10 to 15 minutes to cool off. Then it would happen all over again, all night long, over the sleeping area. The excessive speed finally destroyed the turbine bearings and it locked up. </br></br>

That was last April. Grainger industrial supply delivers in 48 hours. I’ve offered to help. No response. Now with the cool weather, the windows get closed. The farts and the coughs and spent air are there to greet us in the morning.</br></br>

I listen to science shows at night on the radio. I understand zinc, vitamin C and D help boost the immune system. It took me a couple months to get the cheap zinc from an outside vendor. Why was that never issued as a preventative?</br></br>

The ultraviolet lamps that kill the C-virus in three minutes have all burned out, 24 of them, the last one in May. They also provide a soft night illumination for our older clientele trying to walk between the beds to the bathroom late at night.</br></br>

This facility has a ‘mini-yard’ off of each dorm. A 50 x 1000 foot park-like setting with walking trails, a few benches, and tables to get outside for fresh air. We are fortunate to have that. The 90-day time credit was appreciated last June, and the extra vendor package. </br></br>

I suggested the Zoom-style computer visits with family last July, and the system is just now getting installed for 30 minutes of screen time with family members. I developed a process awhile back where the experience could easily be in 3-D without the need for special glasses or screens. I gave a demo at the San Quentin TV production studio while there.</br></br>

I want to scream at the idiocy of the state paying for addicts in the immediate vicinity who steal chemicals from the clinic, mix their own batch, and inject themselves and others in the neck, arm or leg three to four times a day at taxpayer expense, practicing medicine without a license, and destruction of state property themselves, or the inmate workers paid to make the prison wine to sell where neighbors throw up in my living area, start fights, or play their music loud. It gets worse in the name of rehabilitation. </br></br>

When asked to lower the filth, a malicious confrontation takes place defining elder abuse. It takes eight taxpayers to support each one of these idiots, some getting paroled in a month or two to a neighborhood near you. With all of this in front of me, why must I wear a mask over my mouth when the C-virus enters through the eye ducts? </br></br>

The insurance from the clinic of the illegally-used chemicals is far more damaging than minor respiratory distress. When I brought this up to mental health, I was told that’s the way things work here. Remove the word ‘rehabilitation’ from the agency title, who is receiving federal funds to manage this circus. I would love to teach HVAC, copy machine repair, or beginner’s electronics as I have in the past, but there’s no room for that nonsense.</br></br>

Who do I see for lawful release from custody?</br></br>

My father was a civil attorney. As a technician, I am trained to look for broken parts in a circuit. I received formal returns from various agencies, state and federal, on my trial that: </br>

(1) The wiretaped evidence used in my trial is illegal, unauthorized, and voids the conviction.</br>

(2) The absence of calendar dates on the counts voids my conviction. 6th United States constitutional amendment, notice and double jeopardy.</br>

(3) The California Secretary of State returned that the prosecutor in Orange County case relied on actual fraud, manufactured evidence, and lacked probable cause. Trial void. I have all the above documents.</br></br>

I presented all this to the Federal District Court. The respondent was summoned to appear and did not, four times. I was issued a discharge order. I filed for a writ of execution for release from custody. It was denied stating that because of my address, that it is assumed I owe restitution. I do not. </br></br>

CDCR states zero balance owed on three appeals. Records staff here states it’s not their job, despite the Haygood v. Younger decision. If I sit and do nothing at this point, mid-2022 is my CDCR outdate. Holding a senior over 65 without authorization is a felony which I’ve proven with evidentiary backing.</br></br>

The wiretap laws violated by the prosecutor award me $200 a day from 1993, plus attorney fees awarded to prosecute a claim, plus income lost from my active technical trades. Any counsel interested? </br></br>

In closing, my engineer roommate and I, while researching the effects of different lighting frequencies and their influence on behavior modification, stumbled upon a chain reaction of events. Briefly, we had a seven color chart on our table late one night, reviewing the data. Tired, we shut off our overhead room light. </br></br>

The orange security light from the next building shown across the chart and drastically changed the colors. Our interest peaked. We deciphered how this influence of a single frequency of night illumination would have on youth growing up under its influence night after night, on the street, in schools, in public parks. </br></br>

We assembled a detailed report on our findings and it was subsequently published in two separate science research journals. It includes data from G.E. Lighting, and the U.S. Bureau of Prisons, and other reference footnotes. </br></br>

We discovered the foundational cause for gangs and violence in our cities. After locals read the report, they tell me it makes too much sense. Then when you watch the news about officers or kids getting shot or attacked, the evidence is in plain sight.</br></br>

I have developed a simple municipal cure for gang formation, territorial fights and killings, elder abuse, for application in cities as Los Angeles, Detroit, New York, or countries as Iraq and Iran. The report explains why.</br></br>

With the absence of internet access, phone books, or outgoing calls without a pre-paid account, I can’t do anything about promoting this cure sitting here watching reruns of Green Acres. It’s very frustrating. CDCR is spending lots of money on isolating inmates, yet I can’t leave this mess with a federal discharge order, embossed and signed by a federal judge, in hand.</br></br>

A neighbor I’m helping with a legal petition recently received valid confirmation that in fact his nephew raped his three pre-teen daughters while he was away at work, and the nephew threatened the three girls with great bodily injury if they told, to put the father out of the picture for continued access to them. </br></br>

Well, six years later, after confiding in the family pastor about the miscarriages of justice, have produced signed declarations the father is, in fact, innocent of any wrong doing. The interrogation errors would take another page, his no contest plea was forced under duress clearly. </br></br>

Staff here with a duty to act under Title 15, CCR, 3076, state it’s not their job. I have multiple types of petitions in the court of jurisdiction presently. How does he get away from this petri dish of coronavirus and back to his family? No tattoos, no drug or alcohol abuse, no priors, no harsh language, and a fine musician.</br></br>

Thank you for your review of the above points. Sorry for the length. I’ve produced 18 screenplays and the words start to build up. I hope they made sense. Statements made above are sworn to be true and correct this 30th day November, 2020, at Chino, California, by the signature below. Further info on request, if needed. I just hope you get this. Take care.
