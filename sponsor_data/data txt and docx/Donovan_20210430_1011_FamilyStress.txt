This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Donovan.</br></br>

Due to my faith and dedication, power and understanding of Godâ€™s word, the devil takes everything beautiful in my life a holds it over my head. Constantly threatening to kill everyone I know. My faith and service would look as though I was terrified. However, I serve and pray through genuine love for God and gratitude towards Christ.</br></br> 

Being locked in a cell for me has been a extreme nightmare, but the greatest blessing for the things I love.</br></br>

I thank God everyday for my family and friends, and have watched them all endure, elude, and overcome COVID-19. Unfortunately other tragedy has come upon special people in my life, and I was unable to be there to support and possibly empower my health and power, to practice a resurrection.</br></br> 

Most of my days I barely live through them. And all of my days, all day long I am being tortured. I am basically in another place spiritually, which we all are. but I have ports drilled in my spine and have a hose going to every vertebrae in my spine.</br></br>

Previous voices spoke of trying to clone me and my family. In which has completely terrorized me and tormented me with sickening petrified fear. I constantly fight every second of every day looking towards heaven and waiting for Jesus Christ, as well as COVID-19 program to change for the law library to open. So I can attempt to work myself out of here.</br></br> 

My IQ depends on the now ability to understand the legal system and live or re-live the continued trauma, terror, torture, and pain my life is full of.</br></br>

I was born with a nail size mole directly in the middle of each foot as well as in one hand symbolizing the makings of the cross of Christ. And have coincidentally obtained the side scar/pierced side, so I continue to endure with a greater hope, but the greatest pain. I pray for all those in the faith, and encourage all to make God and church the main priority in their life with the times at hand.</br></br> 

The pain on earth and in prison for me is a supernatural desperation. And we need all the soldiers fighting for God, truth, and righteousness we could possibly find.
