This story was told by a person incarcerated at Mule Creek.</br></br>

Caller: Now that things are, I guess everyone is all vaccinated. It's, we're all got, now we are allowed to not wear a mask as long as we have proof that we have tooken the vaccine. But it's also how that whole you asked me, what did you ask me about the whole year thing? Again? You said, how did it affect me? Right?</br></br>

UCI: Like if you could come or, yeah, like this year compared to your other years in the facility.</br></br>

Caller: Just the whole lack of a physical contact with family, mainly. And then the food situation was pretty terrible there for a while we had, we had to wait for them to bring us our food that we had money for. And then, you know, other, the food here sucks. Let me tell you, I wouldn't wish that on anybody. It really, it really sucks.</br></br>

And other than that, we were just, you know, some of us were losing weight and because of the lack of food sometimes. I wouldn't say it was, it was like they treated us terribly or anything like that.</br></br>

UCI: So I'm curious about the, you mentioned, if you're vaccinated you don't have to wear a mask? Are people like honest about that? Or is there like actual proof to like to, to like show that you've actually been vaccinated?</br></br>

Caller: Like me, I wear mine around my neck.</br></br> 

UCI: Oh.</br></br>

Caller: You know, just so I don't have to deal with these cops and have to bullshit with them about anything. You know, other people, you know, they leave it at their house and then they have to argue with a cop about it. Some people got write-ups for not wearing their mask and having the proof on them.
