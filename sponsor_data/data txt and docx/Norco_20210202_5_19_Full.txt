This story was told by a person incarcerated at Norco.</br></br>Caller: Hello. Oh gosh a lot going on now. We have people who are testing twice, who tested positive twice with coronavirus. So okay, so I personally tested positive back in September.</br></br>UCI: Mhmm.</br></br>Caller: And one of the big things that they’re telling us to do is social distance and it’s impossible to do. I mean I’m in a, just so you know, I’m in a- this is a dorm setting, this is not cells. So this a dorm setting and as a matter of fact, my dorm right now is on quarantine.</br></br>We’ve had, in the last two weeks, we’ve had probably about 25-30 people test positive. And like I said, one of my friends who tested positive I think in August, tested positive again on Monday.</br></br>
They have started in my dorm, they’ve given about maybe 10 people the vaccine, the first shot. But a couple of those people have tested positive since then. You know and it's just, it’s- for a lot of us, it's just really scary cause I mean well like I’m saying one of the main things we’re being told to do is social distance and I mean it's all over the news but we can’t- it’s impossible to do that.</br></br>
And you know me, personally, I like I said I tested positive back in September, and you know God with all these new variants, I definitely don’t wanna, I'm praying I don’t test positive again. And I’m eerie from all the health experts is that we can have long-term effects. I mean like I had symp- I was sick, really sick for two days.</br></br>UCI: Mhmm.</br></br>Caller: And I had symptoms. I felt bad a little bit after that, but I was really really sick for two days. And after that I kind of bounced back. But what I’m hearing now is that even if you bounced back, I mean you don’t have to, you don’t have to have serious, you don’t have symptoms and go to the hospital.</br></br>
Just contracting the virus, you can have long-term side effects years down the road, you know, with your heart, your lungs, respiratory problems. And so that’s, you know, that's my concern, you know?</br></br>UCI: If possible, could you tell me about how your facility is handling the outbreak?</br></br>Caller: Okay yeah so, they do pass out, they do pass out masks now every couple weeks. But the problem with that is, for example, the last- matter of fact we should be getting masks tonight. But two weeks ago when we received masks, the officer who brought them to us, he handed them out and he didn’t have on gloves.</br></br>UCI: Mmm.</br></br>Caller: He just brought them over, I don’t know where he came from, but he handed them to the officer in my building and neither one of them had gloves. And so we were, you know, now so now we’re using masks that are possibly contaminated already from the jump, you know. And right after that, that’s when we had another outbreak.</br></br>
You know so, we all we do get temperature checks now just about every day. We get tested now. We get tested and actually testing us every- so they tested us on Friday and we tested again yesterday on Tuesday.</br></br>
Since the outbreak, we’ve been testing like twice a week. I was told after I contracted the virus, to the dorm I’m in now, is that the recovery dorm and it’s not a recovery dorm. And so, gosh, you know, honestly, they’re just really shuffling us around.</br></br>UCI: Mhmm.</br></br>Caller: And um that’s really what they’re doing. And, so you know, there’s a lot of concern here. You know there’s a lot of fear, but you just got to be strong. I’m struggling. I’m actually in the mental health program too.</br></br>I was diagnosed with depression and PTSD. So, you know, honestly, I’m doing okay. I’ve had my ups and- one of the things that really helps me is my faith, you know, I am a Christian. And so that helps me, you know.</br></br>And I’m just trying to stay positive and surround myself with other guys who are positive and then I also I’m doing my part, you know. I do what’s being asked to. I wear my mask, I wash my hands, I try at my desk when I can to social distance.</br></br>So, I’m doing okay as far as that. But, you know, there’s, you know, to be honest with you there’s a lot of people who are really, really concerned now that people are testing positive after they’ve gotten their, the vaccine.</br></br>UCI: Mhmm.</br></br>Caller: And now people are testing positive twice. And we’re hearing on the news with all the new variants out in South Africa, Brazil, and the UK. So guys, guys, we’re not sure, you know.</br></br>UCI: Mhmm.</br></br>Caller: Keep in mind, one thing very important, we’re inmates and so we’re like for a lot of people as far as their concern, we’re at the, you know, we’re at the bottom of the barrel. And a lot of people really just don’t care. Well they’re inmates, who cares, you know.</br></br>UCI: Mhmm.</br></br>Caller: And that’s how staff see us also, not all. If I’m being honest, not all staff. But there are some say like, “Oh well, they’re just inmates.”</br></br>And so there are a lot of people who prefer, especially some of the older guys who have underlying conditions, you know, to be just to be frank. There are guys who really talk a lot, “Well man. Am I gonna even make it home to my family?” You know.</br></br> UCI: Mhmm.</br></br> Caller: And, well it’s a real concern. I just recently had my first grandson. My daughter had my first grandson six months ago.</br></br> And I, you know, it’s something that I think about, you know. I consider it. My friend who just, who tested positive a couple days ago, they moved him to another part of the prison and so I’m really, I would love to hear from him just to see how he’s doing.</br></br>I don’t, you know, we don’t know so, cause after you test positive here, they move you out of here to another place. And so we don’t, you know, we don’t know what’s going on with those other guys so, you know. I honestly don’t know. I’m just doing the best I can, you know.</br></br>Just so you know, we have free phone calls today. We’ve been getting them twice a month now, because of the corona, we’re not able to get visits so that we get free phone calls twice a month.
