This story was told by a person incarcerated at Butte County Main Jail.</br></br>

UCI: I get you. How has the COVID situation at your facility affected your loved ones?</br></br>

Caller: It’s - it’s getting better, ‘cause now they can come and see us. But for like, for example, like in the beginning of this, they didn’t even have visits until like, until like September of this year. From beginning of last year all the way until September, this facility didn’t allow no visits.</br></br>

UCI: Was there a reason why for that? That's a pretty long time.</br></br>

Caller: They said because of COVID, they didn’t want their staff to get infected by it. But, they allowed us two free phone calls a week.</br></br>

UCI: You think that they’re gonna cut you off again since this new variant is starting to pick up?</br></br>

Caller: I think so. I do think so, and it’s kind of scary. You know what I mean? I can’t even get out to get a fucking eye doctor’s appointment. It’s kind of, it’s a little bit scary.</br></br>

UCI: How have you been coping with the crisis?</br></br>

Caller: I been coping, I just been - I work out a lot, you know what I mean? I try to stay focused, you know, like I said I can’t read or write so you know, I try to stay doing cardio. You know, interacting, playing a little bit of cards when I can. You know, just staying active so I don’t lose my bearings, you know?</br></br>

UCI: Do they let you go outside like, a couple hours a day? Or is it like–</br></br>
 
Caller: We’re only out of our cell for two hours a day. We’re locked down 22 hours a day, and like while we’re in our day room, we could either shower and use the phone, or we can go outside for an hour, and use the phone and shower for an hour. So they kind of like got us on zero movement.</br></br>

UCI: Wow. </br></br>

Caller: We’re maximum custody inmates.</br></br>

UCI: Even though it’s a county jail?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, even though it’s a county jail. We’re like, we’re high risk.
