This story was told by a person incarcerated at El Dorado County Jail.</br></br>

Caller: Hello.</br></br>

UCI: Hello.</br></br>

Caller: Hi. I called about half an hour ago from the South–</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, I think I remember, yeah. I think I remember. You were, like, in the middle of your story and then, it was just quiet.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, that doesn't surprise me. Where – where did we leave off at?</br></br>

UCI: You were talking about how the suicide rate has gone up.</br></br>

Caller: Oh, yeah. So since this younger staff has taken over, namely they've imposed a new policy of lock — just locking everybody down all — that way they don't have to do their job as far as classifying inmates as far as, like, you know, separating them.</br></br> 

UCI: Mhm.</br></br>

Caller: They could just put everybody in isolation. So everybody in the Placerville jail is in isolation, solitary confinement. Whether they're good or not, whether they're — whether they're, you know, in protective custody or general population, everybody is in solitary confinement.</br></br> 

Everyone's locked down 24 hours a day, and it's, as you can imagine, detrimental to, you know, their mental health. You got people who are hanging themselves in their cells.</br></br>

UCI: Mhm.</br></br>

Caller: It's never reported; you know? And — and they're infecting everybody with COVID, too, at the same time. The staff is not vaccinated.</br></br>

They keep bringing in new people off the street. They — the staff come and go on a daily basis. And there's no oversight. There's no — El Dorado County has no federal oversight, nobody from the state coming in and checking on them; you know?</br></br>

They don't — they don't anticipate, you know, groups like, you know, like you coming in and checking up on us. There's nobody — until I got, you know, your letter, I didn't know who to reach out to. In fact, I wrote a letter to the editor of the local paper, and they twisted it around, make it sound like that I was just complaining.</br></br>

UCI: Mhm.</br></br>

Caller: I'm just here on a non-violent theft charge. I get out, actually, in - so it – yeah, I was just saying that I do get out in a - and if you wanted me to do any follow-up, you know, I could do that, too. But, yeah, the Placerville Jail right now is – it's a nightmare. It's a fucking nightmare.</br></br>

And they're just — everybody there has COVID. They're not — they're not requiring their staff to get vaccinated. And, so, about - months ago, so I've been in custody since last year, and I was in general population, and they — somehow, they — they moved me from general population to max security.</br></br>

Put me in there with known violent offenders. They put me in a cell with somebody that was in there for kicking a pregnant girl in the head. He ended up biting my ear off. I'm not exaggerating. Biting my ear off.</br></br>

UCI: Oh, wow.</br></br>

Caller: They did nothing — they did nothing to repair the ear.</br></br>

UCI: They just left it? They just left you like that?</br></br>

Caller: Yes. They took me to the hospital, they stitched it up, but they didn't recover the piece of the ear. Still — I'm still — my ear is deformed.</br></br>

UCI: Mhm.</br></br>

Caller: They did — they still have not allowed me to get help for it, not — not sent me to a surgeon, nothing. I'm still trying to get ahold of, you know, some civil rights attorneys and some injury attorneys or somebody, but right now I'm just — I'm just waiting. I've only got - weeks left or whatever waiting to get out, so I'm looking for help.</br></br>

They have done nothing to help me. In fact, I got punished for it. I got — so my — I get my ear bitten off. They put me on 24-hour lockdown for 30 days, and then they extend it.</br></br>

In Placerville, when you're in trouble, you get in more trouble. You get, like, so they justified keeping me on 24-hour lockdown for 100 days straight. I only came out of my cell every other day for 15 minutes to take a shower.</br></br>

UCI: But why did they — so they punished you for getting your ear bit off?</br></br>

Caller: Yes. They said that it was a mutual combat and that I was the aggressor.</br></br>

UCI: Oh.</br></br>

Caller: They said it was mutual combat. They said that I was the aggressor.</br></br>

UCI: Mhm, okay. I see, yeah.</br></br>

Caller: And, so, but the reason — the reason why they did that was so that they had justification to keep me locked down. To suppress me.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: So to distance themself from having any responsibility.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, so they don't have to deal with whatever you have to say about what actually happened, yeah.</br></br>

Caller: Right. And they — they wouldn't allow me to use the phone for 100 days.</br></br>

UCI: Oh, wow. And that was when your — yeah, that was when your ear was — your thing with your ear was happening, so that, yeah, that probably wasn't good for yourself — for your ear.</br></br>

Caller: No, yeah. And, so, they — here's the thing. After the — it happened, I — so I picked up my piece of ear off the floor, and I put it in a cup of water; right? And when they came up there, they had their tasers drawn, and I tried to hand them the cup — the cup with the ear in it, and they said put it down.</br></br>

And I was, like, you know, I need that. And, so, they cuffed me and then they took me to medical and they said, “Oh, oh, mutual fight. Somebody lost their ear.”</br></br>

They — so they rushed me to the hospital. I'm, like, where's my ear? And they didn't recover it for, like, an hour and a half later. And they're — the doctor is, like, well, it's been so long we can't reattach it now.</br></br>

The tissue's become necrotic. If we tried to stitch it back, it would just fall off. So we're just going to have to stitch it up as it is. And, so, there's more than half of my left ear was bitten off.</br></br>

UCI: And, so, they just left it – they just left it like that? Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, they left it like that. So my ear, it's — it's - it's totally disfigured. It's — there's only, like - like half of it's gone.</br></br>

And, so, they put me in — in isolation for four months. I couldn't call anybody. It's — it's healed now, but it's still deformed because half of it's missing.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: And they won't allow me any kind of help. There's no — they said — the doctor says, well, you're just gonna have to wait — you're just gonna have to talk to a plastic surgeon.</br></br>

UCI: Right, when you get out, yeah.</br></br>

Caller: I - I filed a claim with the county. It got denied. But, none of this stuff will you hear about because El Dorado County is just keeping it hush-hush.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, if it's–</br></br>

Caller: So–</br></br>

UCI: If it's not a benefit to them, they're not gonna do anything about it.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah. So these officers that I named, these are the ones who are responsible for putting me in harm's way, failing to keep me safe, and then when the incident happened, they – they're the ones who suppressed me. And I'm – I'm just here on a – on a – on a commercial theft charge. Basically shoplifting.</br></br> 

In other counties like Sacramento County, I wouldn't have even been arrested. They would have just cited and released me. These people are keeping me here day for day on my offense, infecting us with COVID.</br></br> 

I mean, it's a nightmare. It really – there really – somebody needs to alert the state or the feds to come in here and investigate this – this facility because it's gotten out of control.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, I feel – yeah, I think it, yeah, it's – it's awful what's really going on in a lot of, you know, jails and, you know, we always get, like, calls every day just saying how, you know, all the stuff that's happening. And it's so infuriating because, you know, we – we can't do anything about it and it's, like, people on the inside can't do anything about it.</br></br>

I know there's a woman that, you know, she says that she's – she wants to go public with her story when she gets out, and she's gonna take that very serious. And, yeah, it's crazy just, like –</br></br>

Caller: Yeah.</br></br>

UCI: What can — people can get away with. And it's, like, a lot of the time, like, they'll continue to get away with it because, you know, there's no proof of a lot of things and, you know, it's their word versus, you know, everyone else's word.</br></br>

Caller: Well, yeah. So El Dorado County is very much a Cowtown, and the – the people who run it are – they're very cop-friendly. They just think that anybody who's in jail is a dirtbag, that – that – I mean, so Placerville – the nickname for Placerville is Hang Town.</br></br>

UCI: Hang Town?</br></br>

Caller: Hang Town for a reason. I mean, the history of the town, I mean, since the very beginning, they've opted to just hang criminals with no trial.</br></br>

And today, I mean, it still rings true. I mean, and I'm proof of that. So I wrote a letter to the – to the local newspaper and I started getting hate mail.</br></br>

UCI: Oh, wow. Really?</br></br>

Caller: Yes. I started getting hate mail because basically I told them – I – I wrote a letter basically saying the same thing I'm telling you now.</br></br>

UCI: Mhm.</br></br>

Caller: That they're giving us COVID - they're justifying it. You know, they're - they're using COVID as excuse to shut down all – all – basically to do less – not – to do less work. Because of COVID, they don't have to let us out, they don't have to do any programs that are, you know, that would be positive or, you know, what you call enriching or any of that.</br></br>

They just lock us in our cells, justify it by using COVID, and then they're – they're giving it to us. So I wrote a letter to the local paper talking about this. Well, the paper is very cop-friendly, too. They put my first and last name and they write inmate.</br></br>

UCI: Mhm.</br></br>

Caller: So I started getting all this hate mail. I get – I started getting all this hate mail. Like–</br></br>

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: You entitled criminal, this and that.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, and they make it seem like if – like you don't deserve to just have basic human necessities, yeah.</br></br>

Caller: Absolutely. So it's really frustrating, I'm still sitting in here. I mean, thank God I get out in a month, but it's been an absolute nightmare and is, like, you know, it's a good thing that there's, you know, groups like you out there. But –</br></br>

UCI: Yeah. You know, because it's like it's the least that we can do just trying to get, you know, the situation itself was difficult before COVID; you know? Things that would happen in jails and prisons, and now with COVID, it's like, I can't, you know, stories you hear are just, you know, just ridiculous of, like, how people are treated and how people are just being neglected so many human necessities from, you know, just like simple bathing to simple changes of clothes.</br></br>

Some people won't get change of clothes for weeks I've heard, and just like a whole bunch of other stuff that, you know, it's not right. And it's, like, the fact that, like, the state is still allowing it to happen is just – but it's also because it's just not getting any coverage.</br></br>

Because like you said, like, you know, with you when you try to go, you know, you put it in the newspaper, people just, like, automatically shut you down because of the fact that you, you know, you're an inmate which, you know, has nothing to change. That, you know, has nothing to do with the fact that you're still human and still are experiencing something that's not right.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah. So everything that I – everything that I write about, there's a factual basis behind it, but my message is lost in who I am, and that's not – nobody's refuting what I'm saying. They're just saying, oh, well, what you say doesn't matter because of who you are.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah. Yeah. And it's not even, you know, who - yeah, and you're – and you're – it's not – you're being an inmate isn't who you are. It's just a label that you happen to be attached to; you know?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah. So, yeah, El Dorado County, it - there needs to be – I mean, I invite you – I encourage you to – to do research into the – into the – the facilities here because something needs to be done about it for sure. And I'm gonna encourage some of the other guys that I'm in here with to, you know, call and help with their – with the – the assignment.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah. Thank you. Yeah. Yeah, the more stories we get, you know, the more people can realize how this is an issue.</br></br>

I feel like that's the thing, that this isn't getting any media – none of this is getting media coverage, none of this is getting, you know, people are just, like, living their lives. They don't care what's happening. But in reality, there's, like, a big, you know, the - you know, overcrowding itself was an issue, and especially with COVID, like, it's – it's ridiculous.</br></br>

And people have no idea about it. And that's what we're trying to do, just kind of spread the word and, you know, make people aware of what's happening.</br></br>

Caller: Well, the thing is, I don't think they bank on us inmates being educated enough or, you know, having the drive to want to report any of this stuff, but I do. I'm definitely–</br></br>

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: When I get out, I'm going to hit the ground running and, you know, do what I can to expose what's going on here.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, and I think you should; you know? It's, like, hopefully with, like, the, you know, you not being an inmate in the present moment, in the future, you know, hopefully that will make people, like, you know, take your story more serious as well.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, it's just – it's just temporary, yeah. And, so, you know, I thank you for, you know, writing to us.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, no, yeah, no problem. It's – we want to reach as many.
