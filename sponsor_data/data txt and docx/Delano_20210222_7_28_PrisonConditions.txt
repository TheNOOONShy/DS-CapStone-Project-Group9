This story was told by a person incarcerated at Delano.</br></br>Caller: This is really something here, because you know, I mean, they, you know, they come through with tests. They’ve offered people the vaccine, but like there are probably two out of 100 are taking it.</br></br> 

UCI: Oh.</br></br>

Caller: And you know, people really don’t want the vaccine. To be honest with you they don’t come with no tests, you know? It's like, you know, like I said they gave us these, they give us masks, I got my mask, and it’s a cloth mask, I got it about two months ago and I have never been offered a replacement since.</br></br>

UCI: Have you been able to wash the mask? Or do they offer ways to wash the mask?</br></br>

Caller: I mean, I go and I use the state soap they give me, and they go in there and they give us no bleach. You know, they have not come in here and disinfected this wing. So now they moved us back out of C-1 after about two weeks after they brought everybody. They moved people back into this building, they never disinfected this building, they do not offer us any bleach. They give us this sanitary and it’s like 99 percent dilution, you know?</br></br>

UCI: Mmhmm.</br></br>

Caller: Some of the people here, some people got sick and it didn’t really bother them and some people were severely sick for like 10 days but they didn’t, they just left them in the cell. It wasn’t like they didn’t come and say “Here can we give you some vitamins,” "Can we-" you know, they didn’t take people out of the cell when they got sick. Anyone who was quote on quote quarantined gets locked down they do not let them back out of the cells.</br></br>

You know. If you’re on quarantine they will test you, if you didn’t test positive the first time they’ll test you again but anyone who’s tested positive will not be tested again because they say your antibodies will be in you. And then they’ll bring you back out into the population after 14 days.</br></br>

UCI: So do they - when they find that a prisoner has COVID-19 do they treat them differently from other patients besides quarantining them from the rest of the group?</br></br>

Caller: No, they do not even offer them not even a vitamin to take. They don’t offer any type of medication, nothing like that they put them just in a cell and leave them up in there. You know, I’m sure if someone was passed out in a cell they might take somebody out but I do know there’s been five people that have died here. Did they take them to the hospital before they died? I’m not sure, you know?
