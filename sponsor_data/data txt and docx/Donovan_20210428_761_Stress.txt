This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Donovan.</br></br>

To answer your question on, “how have you been coping with this crisis?” For me personally, it has not been any different from the past 24 years I’ve been incarcerated. The main thing was not to worry, keep informed, and wear a mask.</br></br>

This pandemic has been surreal. If it wasn’t for all the reporting of deaths all over the world, I would have never believed that this whole pandemic actually occurred. It's also kinda odd to see everyone around you, on the TV, always wearing a mask. I feel sorry for all those people out there who’s worried about paying bills, losing their jobs, or if they’ll be able to put food on the table.</br></br> 

A lot of things are out of control out there. Crime rate is up, job loss, pollution.</br></br>

It's kind of sad to say but it seems like the lockdowns and isolation on people out there has had a negative effect on people. In the very beginning I told my family now you have an idea how it feels to be in prison. It was only weeks into the pandemic and people were feeling the trauma and stress caused by being on lockdown. I think this pandemic brought out the good and bad from people.</br></br>

I just hope things get back to normal for everyone out there; as much as it possibly can?!</br></br>

If there's anything you need clarifying or further substance on a subject, please feel free to inquire.</br></br>

I respect your effort to help others at a time like this, and what you’re doing as a college student. I’m glad to have shared my story with you. Of course this is my perspective of how I’ve dealt with this crisis. I’m sure others in the prison system have not fared so well. And I just want to take this opportunity to express my concern for those people, and wish them well.
