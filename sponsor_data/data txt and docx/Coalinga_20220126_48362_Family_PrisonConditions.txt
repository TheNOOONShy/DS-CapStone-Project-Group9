UCI: And then what has your COVID situation been like?</br></br>

Caller: Pretty horrific. It took, what, almost a year to get staff to wear masks, shields, to dress appropriately. An unbelievable number of us died. I’ve witnessed some of it. Yeah, it was - it’s been pretty horrific.</br></br> 

I recently lost a family member to COVID back in, what, September of last year. My niece, she was, what, 53, had children, and the [unintelligible] - the hospital has, you know, been locked down and allowing one unit of about 50 patients to come out at a time.</br></br>

We were almost lifting it to go back to normal. The hospital is vaccinated, almost everyone in the hospital is vaccinated and with the boosters, the whole bit. And I have a friend who is relatively healthy on a different unit, I talk him pretty regularly he’s a Christian. He’s got COVID.</br></br> 

Their unit is quarantined and the people who test positive, they're removing from the unit and taking them down to the gymnasium. He lives in a dorm and he’s been sick for a few days. He has not done the vaccine.</br></br> 

He’s, what, 60. He’s about — I think he’s got a birthday coming up. He’s gonna be 60 or he’s 61, something like that.</br></br>

He’s just been sick. The first couple of days kicked his butt and he’s all right. I spoke with him today.</br></br> 

It’s not really a problem for him and it is COVID. But the staff are still coming into the institution, allowed to go from this quarantine unit to an un-quarantined unit and they spread this stuff around. They’re very much aware of it and the hospital staff, the hospital is aware of it. And they’re allowing this kind of behavior to continue.
