This story was told by a person incarcerated at New Folsom.</br></br>

UCI: And so, have they been offering the vaccine?</br></br>

Caller: Say again?</br></br>

UCI: Have they been offering the vaccine?</br></br>

Caller: Yes, they offered us the Pfizer vaccine and I took both shots.</br></br>

UCI: Oh, okay. So how have you been coping with the crisis?</br></br>

Caller: It’s not good. I’ve been trying to find a way that helps us get out of prison because of the virus. And you know, my family, some of them caught the virus. Some of my family caught the virus and it’s hard for them, for me to call them and so I can help them deal with that process. So it takes a toll on me but I try, you know, I try my hardest to just get through it day by day and take every chance I get.</br></br>

UCI: That’s right. And so, speaking of your family, like what has it been like for you to have reduced visitation and programming?</br></br>

Caller: It’s kinda hard because I got a few people that wanna come see me and being that they only give them like once a month. You know, it’s kinda hard because different people wanna come see me and they’re all not on the same visit list. So, it’s kinda hard and it’s stressful.</br></br>

UCI: So, what do you think that, that your facility could do to make the situation better in regards to COVID-19?</br></br>

Caller: I think that they could open it back up and let us, let us have our visits and go to work and have normal programs because if somebody do get sick, they can just put them in a medical bed, you know?</br></br>

UCI: What else did you want the people to know about your experience?</br></br>

Caller: I want them to know that, you know, being in prison during this pandemic, you know, is kinda difficult for us. We wanna see our families, you know, and that they just allow us to go home.</br></br>
