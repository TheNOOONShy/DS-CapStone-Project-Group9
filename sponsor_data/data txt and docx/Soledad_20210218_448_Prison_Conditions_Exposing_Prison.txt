Theme: Prison Conditions: Exposing Prison


Funny thing though, due to the Coronavirus there have been no visits in CDCR since March 2020, but there are still ample drugs and phones everywhere. I wonder where they are coming from? Need cameras.</br></br>
The questionnaire I received from you was premised on causing prison reform. It is psychologically encouraging to believe that someone cares. I could and happily would elaborate on anything I have touched on or any other questions you have. It's unfortunate that human life is still a commodity. Slavery is still alive and well. Even after 23 years in here, I still don't stereotype the guards as most of them do us. And I still absolutely believe that cameras would solve everything that is wrong with these prisons. Not clips used for propaganda from some riot in 1989. With technology advancing the way it is, cameras are getting smaller, cheaper, clearer. If the guards have nothing to hide, "what are they worried about the cameras for"?</br></br>
