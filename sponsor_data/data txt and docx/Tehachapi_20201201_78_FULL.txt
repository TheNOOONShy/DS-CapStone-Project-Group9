Dear whoever it may concern,</br></br>Life itself, whether an individual is free or incarcerated, is never truly easy. Nature is constantly throwing us curve balls around every corner we turn. Each one making an impact of varying ferocity. COVID-19 is one of such curve balls that when is most impact it hit so hard has knocked me off my feet.</br></br>
I am now, 24 years old and have been locked up for three years now. I have only been in California for three months before my arrest. All my family is in Louisiana and Arkansas, causing the past few years to be filled with loneliness, and up until COVID-19, I thought it could not get any worse.</br></br>
 Prison itself is horrible, but once you are in prison during an epidemic, you know hell on earth. I was in vocational training learning about HVAC when a seroyer came up to us and our insecure that our facility was now on quarantine, a correctional officer in our yard had positive. Within a month we were inside our dorms on bunks, no more than four feet way from each other. A month later, nearly a hundred inmates went into isolation for coming down with COVID-19.</br></br> 

Things got real, quick, and as someone who admit when I usually scared, I was scared nonetheless. A month later nearly 100 inmates were in isolation. I am the oldest brother of four sisters and five brothers. Our grandma is fighting cancer.</br></br> 

What will happen to them? Will I ever see them again? I thought stuff like this non-stop, sadly. With money in short supply, my family can hardly afford to pay for collect calls. So communication has become near impossible. So everyday is full of constant worry.</br></br>
 Then, one says a friend of mine put me in contact with the love of my life. His stepdaughter, a woman only 22 years older than myself. She has since acted on the middleman between me and my family. Letting me know how my family have been. A major relief.</br></br>
 So, to sum up this year. Other than not being able to get to school, yard, worship services, or anywhere else outside of my dorm for nearly a year. Life still sucks in here just way more than it ever did before. I only have a year and a half left until I can finally go home and see my family again.</br></br> 

COVID-19 makes time in here go on at a snail’s pace. I cannot wait for the sweet taste of freedom. Mask or no mask.</br></br>
 To anyone who reads this, know that I may be a convict, but I do care. And I pray to the great earth mother that you find yourself in good health and high spirits during these troubling times. Me and my fellow druids the world over wish you peach, health, and safety.</br></br>
 Sincerely,</br></br>
