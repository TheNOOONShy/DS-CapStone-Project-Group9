Hello PrisonPandemic,</br></br>

It so happens that I'm in a cage, when he received your letter, he asked if I felt like writing to somebody from the pandemic project. After reading your letter, I said why not.</br></br>

I don’t know how much info you can get from me from the county website, but feel free to look me up. Besides my name, I was brought up in a foster home in a city, a White mother and a Black father I never knew. I’m doing 16 months with half which is eight months right now.</br></br>

I’m fighting to go, my lawyer to file an arbitration that will give me the opportunity to only do 33 percent of the 16 months. Because of this pandemic, I never went into a courtroom or was able to talk to my lawyer face to face. Everything was done on a webcam, and I only saw him one time and the deal was done.</br></br>

To set in about a county jail and have a lawyer you have never seen or talked to tell you that he has already talked to the judge, and the DA. Because of the pandemic iters and lock deal. Because of the pandemic, a lot of us ceiling blind sided by this.</br></br>

Don’t get me wrong, you don’t have to take this deal, but because of the pandemic, this have to put off your case until whenever. One of the people that lives in the cage next to me went to court the first week of February. He didn’t take the deal, his next court date is the last week of June.</br></br>
 
Because of the pandemic, we no longer have the right to have a speedy trial. My lawyer told me to call him and he will file the motion so I’ll have to do only 33 percent of the 16 months. Call a number, he never answers.</br></br>

Because of the pandemic, there has not been a hot meal in over a year. Sack lunches morning, noon, and night. The same lunch meat for over a year. As for visiting, that was taken away for a year. Now we are told we can one visit a month. We still can’t get visits with our PD lawyer.</br></br>

If you are bless to have somebody to send you a few dollars, the commissary here is a robber, without a gun. Who pays 60 cents for one Ramen soup? For one single popsicle $1.30. One 4.23 ounces of tuna is $2.65, one two ounces of rice, $1.30, one bag of Keefe coffee and the cheap coffee you can buy, is $16 for three ounces. How could this be fair?</br></br>

I’m going to end this now because I doubt you will ever read this because once they read it before it goes out, it most likely end up in the trash. If not, I'm hoping to hear from you. Thank you for caring.
