This story was told by a person incarcerated at Colusa County Jail.</br></br>

UCI: And so, tell me a little what the COVID situation has been like at your facility.</br></br>

Caller: My - the COVID situation, it's, it's been kinda rough, so one morning - I was always 'cause - I was always scared like to lose a family member or something.</br></br> 

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>

Caller: And the, the sergeant comes up to me and he’s like, “Hey, I’m gonna have to pull you out to talk to you,” and I was like, “What do you mean? Okay?” He was all like, “Put your shirt on,” and I was like, “All right cool.”</br></br>

So he put - I put my shirt on and I walked out there with him. I go stand in the red box and he said, “No, just keep going up. Go out to the yard.” And I was like, "Okay."</br></br> 

Now I go out to the yard and say, “Am I in trouble or something?” And he was like, “No, you’re not in trouble or nothing.”</br></br> 

And I was like, “Well, what’s going on?” And he’s like, “Do you have a sister or aunt named [redacted], and a sister named [redacted]?” And I was like, “Yeah, I do.”</br></br>

He’s all like, “Is your dad [redacted]?” And I was like, “Yeah, he is.” And they asked me those questions and then he was like, “Hey, your dad just passed away.” And this just happened like recently.</br></br> 

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>

Caller: Ever since that day, it’s like my COVID experience, COVID-19 experience is like, it’s been kinda rough.</br></br> 

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>

Caller: I was always scared to lose a family member or something like that. And, and, here, here it is, it happened.</br></br> 

UCI: Definitely, yeah. And while I’m in, first off I just want to say, you know, I’m really sorry for your loss. You know, I can only imagine what you’re going through.</br></br> 

You know, it’s definitely always hard when, you know, someone - when you lose someone that you - you’re close to, and it’s one of your close family relatives. So, you know, I just want to say again, I’m sorry for your loss man, and if I could ask you a little bit of follow up questions, if that’s okay with you?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, that’s fine.</br></br> 

UCI: All right cool. You know, you were talking about your dad and how he, you know, the guard kinda pulled you aside and told you the story. How did you cope with that crisis after he told you?</br></br>

Caller: It was kind painful, it, like - I don’t know. I came back into the cell and I’m in an eight man cell so like - I was just like - I told - they were like, “What’s wrong?” I was like, “Bro, my dad just died,” and they wanted me to call my aunt, so I called my aunt and I couldn’t even talk to my aunt. 'Cause like I was, I was in tears, so I was just.</br></br> 

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>

Caller: Like bawling. I was just like, “Oh my God, what am I going to do? Where am I going to go now when I get out?”</br></br> 

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>

Caller: “What am I going to do?" Like, "What’s my life going to be like when I get out?” So it’s just like, I think about that constantly. Every day, every night.</br></br> 

Like, my dad was my everything, that’s who I lived with. And it - I don’t know what I’m gonna do when I get out, you know?</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br> 

Caller: I'm [redacted] years old and I should be doing the right thing but I just chose to hang out with the wrong type of people.</br></br> 

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>

Caller: I got into trouble and that’s why I ended up in here. And then, they came in here and told me that, so it’s like it goes and it comes and it, and it goes and it comes, it’s just, it’s just hard, hard for me to, to accept it. Because he - I was on the phone with him and he was like, he was coughing and talking about, “Oh I got bronchitis, I’m sick,” da da da da da. And I was like, “Well, why don’t you go to a hospital?”</br></br> 

He’s all, “Son, I will go to the hospital.” I said, “Go now.” He said, well - he said, “I got, I got an appointment with them in about a week.” Well, three days later, that’s when it the sergeant came to me and he’s like, “Hey, they found your dad dead.”</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm. Wow. And you said he had already scheduled his appointment, but unfortunately, he was - you know, he died during - while waiting for his appointment?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah. Yeah.</br></br> 

UCI: Wow, man. I’m sorry to hear that and, you know, I can’t - I’m honestly speechless because - you know, it’s - I feel like there should be more resources for people to help out. You know, that are kinda going through stuff, like a little more harder than others with COVID.</br></br>

You know, such as your dad. And you said that he told you that he had bronchitis, you said?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah bronchitis.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>

Caller: And he had just got like his second - his second vaccine shot, but they said that he died of COVID-19, but I’m not sure. I had my aunt go and do an autopsy on him.</br></br> 

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>

Caller: And I’m waiting to hear back from him, to see what the autopsy is.</br></br> 

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>

Caller: And, I talked to the sergeant and the sergeant was like, “Look, since you do have a probation violation out of [unintelligible] county. We can’t let - we can’t release you from here.” Because I only got nine months left in here.</br></br> 

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>

Caller: And they were like, “Well, since we can’t release you to go by yourself, we can take you.”</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>

Caller: So I’m just waiting to hear from my aunt and see when the service is and then they’re going to take me to the service.</br></br>

UCI: Gotcha. So are the, would you say that the correctional officers are kinda helping you a little more? Or are they doing everything that they can to help you out?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah they are.</br></br> 

UCI: Nice.</br></br>

Caller: They are. I kinda, I kinda like, when it first happened, I kinda like went on suicide watch 'cause like - I just - I didn’t know what to do.</br></br> 

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>

Caller: That, that was my - my dad was my everything, and my best friend.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: And my guardian angel, everything. So like it’s just like, I don’t know. It hit me so hard I was just like, “Hey, you might want to take me out of here. I feel like I’m going to hurt myself.”</br></br> 

And then he was like, “All right well, we’re going to take you to the doctor. We’re going to put you on suicide watch.” I was like, "All right." So I was on suicide watch for like a whole day.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>

Caller: But.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm. And you said you were on suicide watch. Could you kinda, you know, kinda tell me a little bit more on what that is?</br></br>

Caller: What? Suicide watch?</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, so is it - did they send you somewhere else? And like watch you? Or?</br></br>

Caller: No. They don’t, they don’t send you nowhere else, they just take - what they do is they take you up to booking.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>

Caller: They put this like, they take all your clothes from you so you can’t hurt yourself or hang yourself with any cloth or any clothing.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>

Caller: And, they put you in this green, I call it a turtle suit, but other people call it like a, some, I don’t know, I call it a turtle suit though.</br></br> 

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>

Caller: It looks like a Ninja Turtle's suit.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>

Caller: But well, they give you that, and they give you this thing called a taco. It’s not hard plastic. They put you in a padded room. All padded room, so you can hurt yourself if you bang your head on the wall, it’s kinda padded.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>

Caller: You won’t hurt yourself, and it’s just right up there where the, where the guards book you in at. And they - and they just watch you. Sit there, watch you, and they come up and ask you if you’re all right. And then you gotta wait for a mental health lady to get here.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: And then you go in there and you talk to her, and then she signs a piece of paper, you sign it, and then she goes back, takes another copy and tells them, “Hey, he’s not really suicidal, he was just feeling like that at the moment.” And they told her like, “He’s not suicidal, he’s never been on suicide watch. I think it’s just because it hit him so hard because his dad died.”</br></br>

UCI: Definitely, Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.</br></br>

Caller: So it’s just kinda hit me, like super hard.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: And messed up my day, I wanted to be watched.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, definitely. Yeah, and I mean, for me, you know, from a personal experience you know, my father was - is also someone who I look up to and, you know. I also see him as my guardian angel as well and, you know, I can only imagine what you’re going through, like I said, and again I’m really sorry for your loss. But, have you, have you been trying to do anything else?</br></br>

Like, to try to keep your mind busy? Like anything, like maybe working out or like reading?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah.</br></br>

UCI: Anything? Mm-hmm.</br></br> 

Caller: I - well I used to work out like every day, and then like when I was told that it just like - I stopped working out so.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>

Caller: I’m just now getting back into working out again. I do like, 400 squats a day.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br> 

Caller: A thousand push ups a day and we do a little bit of bar work and I’m going to school too. So like, every six weeks that I go to school, they take seven days off my sentence so.</br></br>

UCI: Oh, okay nice.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah that’s another thing that’s keeping me busy.</br></br> 

UCI: Yeah.</br></br> 

Caller: I got a bunch of homework I gotta do and stuff like that.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm. Nice man, well I, you know, I just want to say I’m, I’m proud of you man. You know, keep going hard at that, at your school and you know eventually it's all going to pay off man. And I know it will for you, and you know I’m, I’m also very glad that - to hear that you also started working out again.</br></br>

A thousand push ups is crazy. I can barely do like 50.</br></br>

So, that’s, that’s awesome of you man. And 400 squats keep - it’s good to keep the mind busy and the body, body healthy. So definitely keep doing that. Keep doing what you’re doing! Make sure you’re drinking enough - lots of water too if you have access to that definitely.</br></br> 

Caller: Yeah.</br></br>

UCI: You know, you want to stay hydrated and you know, keep your body up to shape as well.</br></br> 

Caller: Okay, yeah.</br></br> 

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br> 

Caller: I do.</br></br> 

UCI: Yeah definitely. And then, aside from that, you know, has - from your facility, how has the like vaccination situation been like over there and what about for yourself. Were you able to get the vaccine or anything?</br></br> 

Caller: Yeah, yeah. I got, I got the vaccine. I got my second shot so I’m waiting, I have to wait six months for my booster shot and then I’ll be done.</br></br>  

UCI: Oh, okay. Nice, nice. So you got the Pfizer, I’m guessing?</br></br> 

Caller: Yeah, the Pfizer.</br></br> 

UCI: Nice, nice. Great, and what about your friends that are inside as well. Were they able to get the - mm-hmm.</br></br>  

Caller: There’s one, there’s one other person in here that’s my buddy, he got the, he got the vaccine too. And he’s waiting on his booster.</br></br>  

UCI: Oh, okay. Cool, cool. So you guys were able to receive that, that access to vaccines in the jail?</br></br> 

Caller: Yes.</br></br>  

UCI: Nice.</br></br>  

Caller: Yes.</br></br> 

UCI: And did they give you guys like information on like the side effects that you guys might feel? Or anything related to the vaccines?</br></br> 

Caller: Oh, so my first shot, I did not get sick. My second shot.</br></br> 

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br> 

Caller: Oh my God. I laid down in my on my bed and all a sudden I just started getting a fever. I started getting cold, cold sweats.</br></br>  

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>  

Caller: And I was sweating.</br></br> 

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br> 

Caller: And when, when one of the guards walked by I asked - I walked up to the bars and was like, “Hey I don’t feel good at all.” He came back and took my temperature. I had a 101 temperature, 101.1 or something like that.</br></br>  

UCI: Wow.</br></br>  

Caller: And, and he’s like, “If it gets any higher, we’re gonna have to take you to the hospital.”</br></br> 

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>  

Caller: I was like, “Man," I said, "I do not feel good." I don’t know what to." I don’t know what was in that shot or whatever, whatever made me sick, but the first one did not make me sick.</br></br>  

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br> 

Caller: He was like, "Well, it's normally a second shot so."</br></br> 

UCI: Yeah. Gotcha. Wow man, so it hit you really hard then right?</br></br>  

Caller: Yeah.</br></br>  

UCI: And I noticed it did say we have one minute left, is there any last minute thoughts you want the world to know?</br></br> 

Caller: No, that’s, that’s it.</br></br>  

UCI: All righty man, well again I just want to say thank you so much for your call and I really appreciated your call. And again from my part, you know, I’m sorry for your loss man. You know, keep your head up. Keep working out, keep that mind busy. Keep reading, keep going to school all right?</br></br> 

Caller: All right, thank you.</br></br>  

UCI: All righty thank you brother, and if you have any other information or anybody that wants to call us in and have COVID-19 related stories, give us a call all right?</br></br>
