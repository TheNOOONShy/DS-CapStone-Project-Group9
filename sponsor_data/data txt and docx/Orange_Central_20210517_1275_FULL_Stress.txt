In the future I hope there will be no cars, no pollution, just air clean and free</br></br>

A safe place for children to live and play, no anger or hatred to get in the way</br></br>

A place where skin color doesnâ€™t matter, no homeless no poor just lots of chitchatter</br></br>

No war just peace throughout all earth for all people to know what life is really worth</br></br>

It can happen if we give it a try, but it has to begin with you and I</br></br>
