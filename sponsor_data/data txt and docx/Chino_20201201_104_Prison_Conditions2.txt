This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Chino.</br></br>

As for the first two to three months went by we fought first for masks. Then for adequate cleaning supplies in which it took 2 more months but, we received them. Earlier I spoke of the social distance aspect of our living arrangements, and I’ll say it again.</br></br>

In the beginning we weren’t six feet apart and even currently, we’re not. When the pandemic first hit this prison was the worst hit, we actually had 17 or more deaths from what I know. I actually was associated with two people who actually passed away.</br></br>

Through introspection I’ve reflected on that, and I must say it was pretty difficult. One of the gentlemen had been incarcerated for more than 20 years. In which he had seven years left, and to succumb to something like COVID-19. For that to be the end, it was terrible.</br></br>

Of course they sent his belongings home, and when the officers gathered his things I couldn’t help but think. He did all that time survived some pretty bad prison experiences and died from coronavirus. At that his family is being sent paperwork, and Top Ramen noodles to remember him by.</br></br>

So at about the fifth month of 2020 they started a mass releasing system. Any non-violent offender within six months of going home was released. This was truly a good thing because it allowed us to get a little more space.</br></br>

So normally there would be 178-190 inmates housed in a 200-man dorm. That number was drastically reduced to 50 inmates per dorm give or take. So all in all our efforts could’ve been way better and naturally because we are inmates we were treated (excuse my French) like shit but, being incarcerated you have to be resilient.</br></br>

So we have looked ahead to better days. As far as quarantining goes we were already quarantining if you feel my drift. We’re locked up already. So really the world kind of got a sense of what it’s like for your freedom to be taken.
