This story was told by a person incarcerated at Chuckawalla.</br></br>UCI: So, to start off, where are you calling from?</br></br>Caller: I’m in Chuckawalla Valley State Prison and I’m just calling to tell that, you know, I’ve been here from when things hit, you know, around February and March.</br></br>
And there’s like, you know, there’s four yards inside of the prison, plus the one yard or whatever. But I’m just referring to the ones inside the prison. I know A, B, and C yard, basically kicked off one after another, as far as it’s spreading and just went like wildfire.</br></br>UCI: Mmm.</br></br>Caller: You could tell, I mean you know, I’ve been down here for a while and I kind of have a sense you know, what’s  - I have a feeling that, you know, what’s going on. Like, you know, I think, you know, for purposes of getting back to a normal situation or getting everybody back into their vocations or everybody back in the school because they’re losing funding by not having it. That everybody needs to be exposed.</br></br>
So, I remember being on this particular yard, on yard B, and we had a particular lieutenant that worked here and, you know, took good care of the yard, was a very respectful man, and so forth. And, you know, he received word that they wanted to put some infected people on the yard. And he said, “Well not on my watch,” you know?</br></br>
And so, you know, due to how people are sometimes a little cozy and so forth, word got around that, you know, he actually emailed Sacramento about it. And when word got back here to the prison, they're like "Who the hell do you think you are?" You know? And now he doesn’t work on the yard anymore.</br></br>UCI: Mmm.</br></br>Caller: And so that’s one thing. And once every other yard was infected, everybody here - they supposedly, a court order mentioned that they were gonna have to come close down a building in the prison, an entire building, and make it a quarantine building.</br></br>
So out of the three infected yards, they decide, "Oh well, you know, let's decide that on that one yard that’s not infected." So, they took 170 plus inmates that were in that building.</br></br>UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>Caller: Negative and they spread them all out to the infected yard, closed the building down, and then started bringing the infected people into the yard in there, into that building. Even though they did keep them quarantined, they didn’t give them yard or nothing. So, they fed them in the building and all this.</br></br>
They continued to take staff that worked in that building and allowed them to come over to work in our buildings. You know, like for overtime and so forth.</br></br>UCI: Right.</br></br>Caller: On top of that, they, I know for certain they've allowed three staff from this building in particular.</br></br>UCI: Yeah.</br></br>Caller: To show up to work, positive. And I know that’s the case because they came in and walked them off. You know, they had to assist them where supposedly when they do test, they email them to know the results.</br></br> 

And if they don’t check the email, then they get right back into work and then when someone realizes, “Hey nobody checked the email. Oh, let's go”, you know? So.</br></br>UCI: Yeah.</br></br>Caller: Very, you know, very faulty system there.</br></br>UCI: Yeah.</br></br>Caller: I guess they allowed one of the kitchen cops to go to work, infected. Got all the kitchen workers from that building, building ten infected so now they started moving people from ten block to all these little, small locations that they had available.</br></br> 

Like family visiting, they had cleared out like some classrooms and the chapel, and they spread them all out in to these little places if they haven’t actually tested positive yet. But they were just waiting cause it was just a matter of time.</br></br>
And my building, just turns out to be the absolute last holdout. And they decided they were gonna come over here and move us in the same way. Well all the people that-</br></br>UCI: Wow.</br></br>Caller: Were moved from ten, ended up getting infected and I mean like within the few days. You could literally see them moving all their stuff over to 11 block.</br></br>UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>Caller: Where they made the quarantine building. And then, our building, they come in and says, “Look everybody, everybody pack your stuff. Everybody’s gonna be moving.” And we all kinda, I mean I hate to say that we incited or anything, but we all kinda said, “You know what? We refuse your treatment. We see what’s going on.”</br></br>
And next thing you know, we had a couple lieutenants walk in here and they’re like, “Look this ain’t us, we’re just following the CMO.”</br></br>UCI: Mmm.</br></br>Caller: And we’re just, you know? And we were pretty heated. We just don’t want to catch it, you’re putting our lives in danger. You know?</br></br>
So what they did is they got on the phone and whatever and next thing you know, medical comes over here with all these waivers and releases. We had to sign two forms, why we’re refusing medical treatment.</br></br>
And I literally put on mine, “Hey, you know, I’ve seen your treatment and I’d rather take my chances. I’ve seen everybody bring out of that building, taken to the infected building.”</br></br>UCI: Wow.</br></br>Caller: You know? You’ve taken my complete trust and I mean my safety and my security is supposed to be in your hand and I’m a lifer, you know?</br></br>UCI: Yeah.</br></br>Caller: And now I, you know, it’s gone, you know? To me, I mean I thought, you know, back in the 60s or maybe even prior to that there was a thing where you’re not even supposed to experiment with inmates and so forth. Well it seems to me like something he knows that was deadly and, I mean, I saw on the news day in and day out. Experiment with, you know?</br></br>UCI: Yeah does it.</br></br>Caller: Not only that, like this, you know you would think, should shelter in place if nothing else.</br></br>UCI: Yeah.</br></br>Caller: You know?</br></br>UCI: Do you feel like other people also share that sentiment that you’re being like experimented on?</br></br>Caller: Oh absolutely. Well I don’t know about experiment. I’m just - I just use that as a, not experiment and per se. You know, I mean I just saying that they didn't know, nobody knows anything about this disease.</br></br>UCI: Right.</br></br>Caller: Other than, it's deadly, that it has long term effects, which I am suffering from, and you know, now I have a cough that I never had. I got headaches that I never had and you know, I just.</br></br> UCI: So, you’ve been infected then? That’s my understanding, yes?</br></br>Caller: Yeah. They, it - yeah. I mean it was inevitable.</br></br>UCI: Yeah. How do you think they - how would you - do you have any idea how they could have done this better? Or like, or even how they, you know, where did this all go wrong? It sounds like a lot of mistakes were made.</br></br>Caller: Well, I actually filed an appeal.</br></br>UCI: Oh okay.</br></br>Caller: It said, look you know, I said I mean I didn’t follow through on it. I got it back from the first level, they denied it but, they - I said, “You know, you guys are allowing staff that are working in an infected building."</br></br>UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>Caller: "They come and work in other buildings and you’re endangering not only the inmates, you’re endangering the other staff that are working with them, their families. I mean you’re touching our mail, you’re touch-." You know what I mean, everything.</br></br>
And I said, “You know, can’t you at least dedicate a specific set of staff for that building? So that you don’t cross contaminate.” They were all, I mean it was just ridiculous what they wrote back. You know, “We have things-”, they’re not gonna listen to an inmate first of all. I mean that’s just, you know. So yeah, it was just it’s kinda like, you know, talking to a wall.</br></br>UCI: Right. It sounds like the other guys in there are sort of share your perspectives on things so.</br></br>Caller: Oh, without a doubt. I got a guy sitting on the right of me right now that’s calling right now. We’ve got I mean everybody in my cube is calling, we just barely got the number, you know what I mean, so.</br></br>UCI: I’m happy about it.</br></br>Caller: You should be receiving plenty of calls.</br></br>UCI: Okay. What’s the, is there a feeling, like an overall, is there a vibe inside right now? Are - I know some people have expressed, you know, guys are kinda scared.</br></br>Caller: Well it’s kinda weird. As long as it’s gone on, you don’t hear of anybody in here talking about lawsuits putting us in jeopardy, the potential, you know, I mean just for, you know, the lack of diligence, the ineptitude, the you know? I mean.</br></br>UCI: Yeah.</br></br> Caller: They tried to space things out a little bit. I heard they, least a little bit, sort of space from Ironwood, which is right next door. And they got rid of, you know, quite a few people to make space. So there was only like eight people per cube.</br></br> 

But you know, even though that helped in a sense, you know, obviously for this yard, I mean we made it literally until like a month ago without anybody getting infected. But you see them allowing.</br></br>UCI: Oh really?</br></br> Caller: Yeah. Due to them allowing people to come in here infected like to work, you know?</br></br>UCI: Yeah.</br></br> Caller: It’s just - yeah nobody asked me about this situation.</br></br>UCI: I can't imagine how it would be. Can you tell me about how your routine and your daily life has been impacted by these things? I know some people have, you know, told me about visitations being cancelled, things like that.</br></br>Caller: That’s horrible right there, I mean mental health wise. I mean they’ve offered you two free phone calls a month since, I don’t know, February or March, or something like that. But that by no means does that take the place of a visit.</br></br>UCI: Wow.</br></br>Caller: I mean they’ve like allowed us to get two packages a quarter which is kind of unheard of but still, I mean, unless you're like, people - be really got money or something, who can even afford that?</br></br>UCI: So just to clarify, it sounds like the two phone calls were like a policy change that they, they’re now giving those away because of, they took away the visiting restrictions?</br></br>Caller: I don’t know. Well that’s in place of visiting.</br></br>UCI: Got it, right.</br></br>Caller: So, they got, I guess CDC got along with GlobalTel, and I don’t know who’s paying for it. I don’t know but we’re getting it now. They got it all set all the way through like next May, so I know there’s not supposed to be, and I’ve heard there’s not visiting in 2021 so, you know? I don’t know and that’s you know?</br></br>UCI: Right. Have they told you that?</br></br>Caller: I’ve heard that from like the Men’s Advisory Council which is you know?</br></br>UCI: Oh wow.</br></br>Caller: I’ve heard that, let me see what else was I gonna say? Oh, yeah and another thing is, you know from the beginning, you know they give us these cloth masks and I’m not talking about N95s either. I’m talking about like some inmate manufactured cloth masks like say a sweatshirt type of material.</br></br>UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>Caller: And that’s what we’ve had all the way until we were infected. When we were issued two N95s.</br></br>UCI: Wow. Have you been able to like wash those or anything like that?</br></br>Caller: No. 'Cause I mean it’s like if you have any hair on your face or anything like that, that little material starts coming apart.</br></br>UCI: Right.</br></br> Caller: Then it’s like getting - interfering with your breathing and everything. So anyway, they’re gonna cut us off.</br></br> UCI: Yeah. Well, thank you so much for calling. You know, tell the other guys inside to definitely keep calling.</br></br>Caller: Okay, I will. You guys have a good night.</br></br>UCI: You too, thank you so much.</br></br>Caller: All right, bye bye.
