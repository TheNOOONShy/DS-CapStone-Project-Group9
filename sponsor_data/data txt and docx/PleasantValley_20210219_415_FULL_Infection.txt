How are you? I hope this letter find you well. Let me say thank you for taking the time out three write me, and sorry it took so long for me three write back. The reason being I was undecided on whether I should write you back because I don’t know you, but I figured this was a genuine act of kindness, and concern, so here I am writing you optimistically.</br></br>
Well I do have a story, as a prisoner, being incarcerated at Pleasant Valley State Prison. I contracted the Coronavirus back in the month of November. I didn’t experience any of the symptoms of COVID-19 except for a runny nose, and cold chills. Other then that I had no other symptoms.</br></br>

I was definitely one of the lucky ones. But I’m worried every day that a guard could bring the Coronavirus up in here, and I can catch it again, and the next time it would be worst, possibly even fatal. That’s my worst fear, being we don’t have control over who we come in contact with when it comes three a guard.</br></br>
Okay, thank you for letting me share my story with you, I don’t mind writing, well let me let you go and end this letter. Take care.</br></br>Always,</br></br>
