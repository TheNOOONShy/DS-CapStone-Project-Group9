This story was told by a person incarcerated at Avenal.</br></br>

Caller: But that doesn’t matter because I can go to the day room and sit at a table with three other guys, or go into the TV room and sit next to four, five, other guys.</br></br>  

So, you know the social distancing is not really, is not really being met in here. So, they are providing some people with the vaccines, but there is a big old controversy about that. I mean, I don’t really, don’t know what much else to say, you know, except that quite a few people have died in here because of catching the COVID.</br></br>

Those of us who are force enough to catch it and make it through, I won’t take the vaccine personally. I’ve been hearing stories from officers about the vaccine is a governmental conspiracy to control the population. You know so, when you have, when you have people from the free world talking about, they don’t want to use the vaccine, you know how they expect us to get the vaccines you know? </br></br>

I’m good, I’m not gonna get the vaccine. It takes years and years and years to perfect the vaccine. They did it within months, you know, and they all got emergency releases of the vaccine, so they don’t have enough background studies on it, so, but those who are taking it, my bunkie took it, he was a never never, which means he never, he never had the COVID so, that’s kind of a good thing.</br></br> 

I know that some people take the vaccine and gotten sick after the second shot, a couple, even a couple of officers have died from taking the vaccine. So, I mean I don’t know what more they can do for us as far as the COVID but they’re trying to open up the program again and I think it’s kind of a stupid idea because I watch the news every day and you know there’s like two more variants of the COVID coming, and it's supposed to be worse than the first one.</br></br>

But for some stupid reason they want to go back to normal programing and intermingle all of us, you know. I don’t know what else you’d like to know but -</br></br>

UCI: Yeah this is -</br></br>

Caller: I can tell you this, when the COVID first started, I caught the COVID of late July, of last year and the captain came into our building and he said that if you know, at least 30 of us get sick, they’re gonna quarantine the whole building. But they informed us that if at least 30 of us came out sick that you know, they would quarantine the whole building and it’ll be what it's gonna be. And so, and then this happened because a couple guys started getting sick in here.
