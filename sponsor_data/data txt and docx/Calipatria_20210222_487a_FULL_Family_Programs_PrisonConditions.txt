To PrisonPandemic,</br></br>

In February 2020 when the first case of COVID-19 came out in the US, everybody here in prison thought it was not a big deal. It was just like (H1N1) swine flu 10 years ago. When they told us they were going to cancel visits we thought it was going to be for a month or two.</br></br>

It’s been a year. I have not physically seen my family since February 2020. They just started doing video visits in January of 2020. It’s only for 30 minutes, but hey better than nothing.</br></br>

Many people in prison are going through hard times but I think most of us are. So many people on the outside have lost their jobs or are out of work due to the pandemic. But must say canceled visits have been the worst for prisons. Physical touch is very important in a relationship especially for children and family.</br></br>

For me the hardest thing was losing my grandfather to COVID in June of 2020. He was 81 years old. This is a man who raised me from birth and did the best he could. I never got to say goodbye.</br></br>

My friend in another prison lost five members of his family, father, mother, two brothers and an uncle due to COVID. Many here in prison have died, most of them got it from the free staff and correction officers. Now CDCR has put all California prisons on a modified program. But I feel this is the best way to keep everybody safe.</br></br>

Before the pandemic, there many programs here in prison like AA, NA, church, high school, GED classes and college courses. But now they have made so can do all work in your cell.</br></br>

I’m also happy to say that I got my first vaccine yesterday. So things going good here, there is light at the end of the tunnel. In the time being I am stay busy with my college work.</br></br>

Well UCI team I hope this helps you with your project (PrisonPandemic). I would not like to remain anonymous. I am also sending my bio and contact info for the purpose of seeking pen pal friendship. Also if anybody has any new questions about prison and the pandemic.</br></br>

Thank you your time, hope to hear from you. God bless, be safe out there.</br></br>

Signed.
