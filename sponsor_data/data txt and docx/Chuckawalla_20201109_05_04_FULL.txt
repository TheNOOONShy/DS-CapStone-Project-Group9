This story was told by a person incarcerated at Chuckawalla.</br></br>

Caller: During this whole situation, when it first started, I had a - a free staff worker in the kitchen come up positive. They tested four kitchen workers and they had the whole setup where they could have been quarantined in the chapel and in education.</br></br>Instead of quarantining those individuals, they sent them back to four block and those individuals tested positive and got the whole building sick. Instead of quarantining them. Then they started moving people from A yard to B yard in the middle of the night, so more people got sick. And then it's just been like that the whole time. Nobody's been wearing masks, off and on.</br></br>It's not enforced. They have a two-tier system where one tier is supposed to be in the day room at a time. They don't enforce that. Staff wasn't wearing masks in the whole beginning of this thing. Now they are intermittently and now they're really starting to press the mask thing because people are pressing the mask thing on them. So we'll see how that goes. It's just been - I went out to a colonoscopy and was quarantined for 22 days.</br></br>Supposedly you're not supposed to lose your bed or your job. I lost both. And it took me, like, two to three weeks to get both back. Then I got back to my building. So it's just been one thing after the other.</br></br>UCI: Okay. So how was the COVID situation handled at the beginning compared to how it's being handled right now?</br></br>Caller: How is it right now? Well, right now we have a lot of guys testing positive again in C yard and D yard. The cases jumped to, like, 200 and something. We just had one guy test positive on our building last night. Now they took one of them to quarantine and they took the other one - the other seven guys to A3, which is a - like a hold quarantine building to see if you're going to test positive or not.</br></br>But the guy that actually tested positive came from Wasco State Prison because they're transferring people in again. So he tested positive when he was here. I don't know if he got it here or he brought it with him, but another one in three block tested positive and he came from Wasco State Prison also. And, so, they have over 70 cases in three block now once again.</br></br>UCI: What do you think would make the situation better at your facility?</br></br>Caller: Just basically following the rules, enforcing the rules. There's no rule enforcement. That's, like, we're supposed to be separated. We're not supposed to be together. Well, when we're out on the yard, you'll have five building's yard crew workers, and three building's yard crew workers, and we're out there, our yard crew workers will be out there. When they're out there, they still let inmates come in and out of the buildings from different buildings which they shouldn't do.</br></br>It's just follow the rules. Follow the rules that are set down. And, I mean, I can understand because the building we're in, no matter what, it's - it - it is what it is. We're in cubes. Everybody's close together. We all use the same bathrooms. We all use the same toilets. We're only three feet away from each other in our cubes. So of course, no matter what, if it gets in here, it's spreading.</br></br>That's just the way it is.</br></br>UCI: How many people do you have for each?</br></br>Caller: Each cube?</br></br>UCI: Yes, sir.</br></br>Caller: Eight people.</br></br>UCI: Okay.</br></br>Caller: Yeah. And they're only three feet apart.</br></br>UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>Caller: At the most. And like I said, everybody uses the same bathrooms, there's only two toilets in, like, each thing, there's only five sinks, everybody uses the same thing. They just put in hand sanitizer things last week. They finally got those in here after all this time, which they said they were going to do in the beginning.</br></br>It - it's like I said, it's just the whole thing is - a lot of it's just following the rules, follow the rules, follow the rules, follow the rules.</br></br>UCI: How have you been coping?</br></br>Caller: I'm doing - I got very sick. I got pretty sick. I lost my sense of smell. I still haven't had my sense of smell back for six months, so that worries me. I'm worried about getting sick again because I'm almost 60 now. And it was rough the first two days.</br></br>It was pretty rough because I had chills and body aches, and I had a cough for a long time. But I'm all better now. But I'm just hoping that I don't get it again. And I'm trying to do everything I can to stay away from it.</br></br>UCI: What's it been like for you to have the reduced visitation and programming?</br></br>Caller: Oh, yeah, we - we have nothing going on right now. I mean, basically - because I'm in education, we're having none of that going on.</br></br>As far as our medical goes, as far as dental, glasses, anything like that, forget about any of that because that's not happening. No medical really so to speak of except for outside medical. And that's an emergency. That's about it. And we're getting our yard. That's a good thing. We still get a little bit of yard, we still get our canteen, all our packages and stuff like that, but it's still - it - they still don't follow the rules, rules, rules.</br></br>UCI: The guards and the officers are not following the rules?</br></br>Caller: No. No, they just don't enforce them. They don't enforce them.</br></br>UCI: They don't enforce the rules among the prisoners?</br></br>Caller: Yeah. Yeah, because they're lazy. I mean, when it comes down it, they - they're just - they don't want to do that part of the job; you know what I mean?</br></br>And just with us, of course, people are going to do what they do. They're going to go down to the day room when they're not supposed to be down in the day room, and they're going to do - try to go out to the yard when they're not supposed to be out in the yard.</br></br>UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>Caller: And people are going to come into buildings when they're not supposed to come into buildings; you know what I mean? And inmates can't really control that. I mean, you can try, but that's not - that's not your job; you know what I mean?</br></br>And they - they have to enforce that. I don't care if it's to where, like, okay, listen, we're going to write you guys up if you don't do this. Because basically you're still putting people's lives and health in danger when you're letting people run amuck.</br></br>UCI: Are the guards wearing face coverings and complying with -</br></br> Caller: Well, now some do and some don't. And some, if you say something to them, get serious attitudes.</br></br>Like we had a female officer come in here from Building three the other night - that's another thing. They come in from other buildings that are positive and work at other buildings that aren't. We had one come in from three building the other day after they just had 70 cases in there. She came into our building and did not wear a face mask all day long the whole day. And now if you go say something to them, then your little cube might get tore up, all your stuff gets tore down because they don't - you know what I mean?</br></br>They don't want you saying things to them. Like, no, you're supposed to wear it. If we have to wear it, you have to wear it. Oh, no, you don't want to do that.</br></br>UCI: Okay. So some of the guards wear it and some don't.</br></br>Caller: Yes. Yes. Some do, some - some wear it like religiously.</br></br>UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>Caller: And others just won't - won't do it.</br></br>They, like, nope. Nope. Nope.</br></br>UCI: Can you by chance remember how it was - how the response to the virus was being handled month-by-month since the beginning?</br></br>Caller: At first in the beginning we didn't really have any, like, paperwork telling us what was happening, what to do, how to do it, anything like that. None of that happened. Then we finally got face masks. And then they finally started putting paperwork up about what the symptoms were, this and that.</br></br> UCI: What month was that?</br></br>Caller: I would say - let me see. I would say end of May/June, somewhere in there.</br></br>UCI: Okay.</br></br>Caller: But at that time, nobody's really getting tested, the guards weren't getting tested, the guards weren't wearing masks. We each had, like, three little cloth masks.</br></br>Those are all we still have now is these cloth masks that they - they wouldn't even let me in the hospital with the cloth mask when I went to go get my colonoscopy. They told me, those things don't really work anything. I was, like, wow. Okay. And then they gave me an N95 mask. I was, like, all right. But, yeah, it's been getting better - better little by little. But like I said, they're still - still transferring people in here, still moving people around, and that causes a lot of, like, reinfection.</br></br>UCI: What else would you like people to know about your experience?</br></br>Caller: Just that, you know, no matter what, it's serious. We're going through it. People are getting sick. People are dying. And a lot of people, staff, inmates, both just aren't taking it serious.</br></br>And it needs to be taken serious because like I said, people are dying in prisons all across California, and they just haven't learned to do what they need to do yet and they're not, like I say, following the rules, doing the things they need to do, moving people from prison to prison because just I don't know how they test before. I don't know if they test them before they come or they just give them a temperature check, whatever it is, but whatever it is, that's not working.</br></br>I think that's enough.</br></br>UCI: Okay. Thank you so much for calling in to PrisonPandemic. It is now 5:18. Please let - let your friends know to call in. And we also have a P.O. Box.</br></br>Caller:	Thank you for your help.</br></br>UCI: Yeah. We also have a P.O. Box.</br></br>Caller: All right.</br></br>UCI: If you'd like to mail us -</br></br> Caller:	Okay. What's the P.O. Box?</br></br>UCI: Okay. So it's P.O. Box 4430 in -</br></br> Caller: Okay.</br></br>UCI: Okay.</br></br>Caller: 4430.</br></br>UCI: 4430 Sunland, CA. Sun, S-U-N -</br></br> Caller: Yeah.</br></br>UCI: - L-A-N-D, land. Yeah. California, 91041.</br></br>Caller: Okay. Thank you.</br></br>UCI: Thank you. Okay.</br></br>Caller: All right.</br></br>UCI: All right. Call back any time.</br></br>Caller: Have a good night.</br></br>UCI: You, too. Thank - thank you.</br></br>Caller: Okay. Bye-bye.</br></br>UCI: Good night.
