Now what would make you say you know I have what it takes to get through it! You don’t know me at all.</br></br>

Since 2007, I’ve seen plenty, but it’s prison! From assaults, stabbing, and so on, the saddest was seeing that kid hanging from when I walked by, gray and dead. 22-year, old kid. He couldn’t take it in his young mind.</br></br>

I’ll be 59 in January. I’m diabetic. I was a little concerned because I am diabetic, so I already got it and the nurse tells me I’m asymptomatic. Oh, well, I guess I made it through another war.</br></br>

You ask about safety in here! They don’t care because if staff can go home everyday, they’re the ones who bring it in and that’s the truth. We stay here.</br></br>

The visits are not reduced. Get it right. There’s no visits and there haven’t been any since February or March. Hardly no yard. They do and run the prison the way they want to and blame it on COVID.</br></br>

I know I have a hernia and it’s been four months. They tell me we can’t take you for x-rays because of COVID. Shit. They take x-rays on B yard. No need to go to the hospital. They’re full of shit.</br></br>

Safety in here. Stop playing. You’re more in danger. But the correction officers pass them to the inmates, and that’s the truth.</br></br>

I’ve been in since my daughter’s mom was pregnant and now my daughter is going on 14 years now, and her and I get along well. She’s used to seeing me and likes me. Dad, when can I see you and of course, I get upset. But her and I have long conversations about COVID-19.</br></br>  

So she’s very aware of it as well of its seriousness.</br></br> 

So all I do is, is tell her like this, okay, little mama, that’s what I call her. You’ve been there all of this long time now and all you have to do now is wait two more years and I’ll be home and she tells me, “Okay dad, like that is not long.” I parole in January. I do tell her that it’s not that long.</br></br>

I tell her to keep her mind on her home studies and yes, I’m very proud of her. She gets As and Bs, so I’m cool.
