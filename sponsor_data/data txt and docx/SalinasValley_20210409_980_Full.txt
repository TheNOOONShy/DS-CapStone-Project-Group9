This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Salinas Valley.</br></br>Hello PrisonPandemic,</br></br>An Inmate at Salinas Valley, I’ve gotten your letter and here’s my story; At the beginning of the pandemic, I felt sad and satisfied with the lockdown. Why? I thought, maybe everyone will understand how a person fills locked away from everything he or she loves to do. In prison I’ve always been an angry person, complaining about everything and why did God turn a simple joy ride into a 23-year sentence.</br></br> Imagine at the age of 23, I thought, my life is over. I accept it, in hope to change. When I was a kid, I was well behaved did all my chores around the house. The only thing was that I always fought my bullies at school. At 18 I graduated high school and searched for a college I might want to go to, but my teachers advised me I might want to learn how to live on my own first. Made a lot of sense because I’ve been a foster child since 12.</br></br>So, I joined the workforce and I exceled at my duties and grow in the company, but out of work I was having bad luck. First, I was robbed by the local thigs, then I lost everything in a fire. I became homeless and lost my job, which a lot of people are experiencing right now. I want them to know there’s hope and this is coming from someone who went to his death bed with COVID.</br></br>It was first announced to be present in the facility around September and we went into modified lockdown where we were fed in our living quarters and recreation programs were every other day. Everyone would be rushing to call home because some inmates would get the news of a family member’s death. Oh man, there would be so much drama. Prison is like that, there’s always drama, more so now because there’s no visits, so everything is more on edge.</br></br> When I was at work (central kitchen) I was most happy, because I love to work and we were safe, getting tested every week for COVID. I thought I wouldn’t get sick, I would know it before it would get to me, turned out I was wrong. In late December it got bad, the whole prison went on lockdown. There was a rumor that several inmates died at the hospital and their families were angry. Lockdown didn’t affect me so much because I was a critical worker, and we get called to work.</br></br> One of those days I was talking to a co-worker and friend who looked like he had symptoms, but I doubted he had it. Due to the weekly COVID test and this is a person who I share meals with time and time again, man. Days later I couldn’t get out of bed, couldn’t eat, sleep, had a fever, headache. Man, I thought, “I’m going to die in here”. I really felt the power of death. So, I picked up the bible and started to read. I thought, “I must know GOD before I die”, right.</br></br> In the past I knew, but I didn’t know that God was there. Reading about Christ’s life made me weep uncontrollably. The son of God and our teacher gave his life for his students and followers. One of those nights I had a vision (dream), he was showing me the stars and asking me to make my body acceptable and man! Let me tell you, this gave me strength and self-empowerment. I started a vigorous workout every day and whooped that COVID out of my body.</br></br>And not only that, I went from 262 lbs. to 290 lbs. I guess what I’m trying to say is hard work and with love in your heart can make a miracle. I know that a lot of people don’t believe God, but know this, God believes in us, right now they’re passing out vaccinations and that itself is a miracle. A lot of inmates are fusing it, but I advise them they could save not only their own lives but someone else’s as well.</br></br>Now I’m a more grateful man than ever, even though I’m in prison. I know with the grace of God and self-determination I can accomplish much! And being kind changes most people and are willing to be positive along with you and together we’re great! That’s my pandemic story, I thank you for your time and support.</br></br>May God bless you guys.
