This story was told by a person incarcerated at Fire Camps.</br></br>

Caller: They put us back into the quarantine cells, but they continued to allow us out of our cells to pick up our food trays. They continued to allow us to mingle with level three inmates while they were being released, and we were taking showers and going to breakfast.</br></br>

We were taking showers, so we were having direct contact. They never wiped down any of the showers after we used them until I made four or five complaints.</br></br>

UCI: That's amazing. You can't make that up.</br></br>

Caller: No, it's amazingly incompetent. No, this is all true. I have - I have records for this.</br></br>

UCI: That's amazing.</br></br>

Caller: I have this all on file. They did not give us disposable food trays as they were supposed to, and I was letting them know this on a daily basis.</br></br>

UCI: Oh my god.</br></br>

Caller: They ended up leaving us in quarantine for 36 days. And we don't know why. Normally the quarantine was 14 days, and you'd leave on the 15th day.</br></br>

They allowed people that we had direct contact with, that were also on quarantine, but we were having direct contact with them, but when their doors would pop, we would all go down and get our food together, and we would mingle, stop, and hang out.</br></br>

We were all touching the same handrails. The handrails weren't getting wiped down. Again, we shared the same shower with the other groups that were transpacing to other facilities for fire camp.</br></br>

So we came back on Thursday, I believe it was June - July the 22nd, and they were still allowed to leave the facility on July the 23rd. And we're talking about 22 people.</br></br>

UCI: Wow.</br></br>

Caller: What had me completely blown away is the fact that they refused to give us any hand sanitizer. They refused to give us any vitamins. They refused to give - allow us to go outside. They refused to allow us to get on the telephone.
