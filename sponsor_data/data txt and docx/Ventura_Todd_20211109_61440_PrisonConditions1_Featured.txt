This story was told by a person incarcerated at Todd Road Jail.</br></br>Caller: Well, one, they can - they don't - they used to sanitize. Now they don't sanitize. And when they did sanitize, it was not really a sanitize - they wasn't sanitizing anything, you know?</br></br> They used one rag to clean all sections. And they kind of just run through it on like quickly, not really efficiently or - or like correctly, you know? And they don't do that no more. They used to do COVID cleaning. They don't do COVID cleaning no more.</br></br>There's no sanitation, and there's - it doesn't even feel like COVID exists in here. The only thing - the only reason we hear about COVID is on the news when we watch TV, but other than that, like they're - they're not really too focused on the COVID in here. You know, deputies have masks.</br></br>They have nice masks, but rarely will you see inmates with masks, rarely. I - I don't - I don't know how else to put it, but it doesn't seem like they really care.
