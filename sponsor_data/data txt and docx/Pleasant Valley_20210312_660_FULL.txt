This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Pleasant Valley.</br></br>I send my utmost joyful blessings to the both of you. And hope all is well as can be out there. I’m doing good thanks to knowing Jesus Christ in my life. For all evil works will not come to pass but fall by the side.</br></br>But don’t get me wrong, I am staying on my toes – mask-up and hands off the face until they get washed real good. You would think I was a ballerina. Well, more like a kung-fu panda…lol. Anyways I got your message and thank you for all your good thoughts + the hopeful smile your team brings to his crazy world.</br></br>Not seeing family or friends hug can get a little too much in here. Plus, to top it all off not being able to call; regardless if its money, quarantine, or people staying away from anymore drama because of their own drama. God did not make man to be alone, he made someone for us to be balance and a peaceful love. But if you fell no love and alone, remember Him in uncertain times,</br></br>As for my story, it goes far back, for why I am in prison. With a Fresno PD lying to make his case on me. And being put through this COVID-19; to only not know if Mom being in good hands. Like I said before, safety inside is not given to inmates.</br></br>From watered down disinfectants to clean the cell. From symptomatic people not being moved to a quarantine facility. On March 5, 2021 two cells have infected inmates in building C-3.Now the rest of us have to stay on quarantine for two weeks. No programs, phone calls, store, or package.</br></br>And I need my package to bring some kind of stability. It’s said we can have the store and packages, but staff and correctional officers do not want to let us (in 3C yard building) have it until quarantine is done.  I was tested on March 8, 2021 and was not infected.</br></br>I just want my Johnson & Johnson vaccine shot, so I could go home soon and be a healthcare helper for Mom. With the no-contact visits I lost seeing family and friends. But one day all will be right, as I hold on to faith Jesus has made me do better things in His name until then ill bet the Lion – so I can be the sheep I am!</br></br>God bless every step you both take and the team at UCI.</br></br>
