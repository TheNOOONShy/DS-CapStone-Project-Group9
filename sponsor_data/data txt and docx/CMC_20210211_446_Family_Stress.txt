This letter was written by a person incarcerated at CMC (California Men's Colony).</br></br>

It’s almost indescribable to go through COVID-19 without having a loved one or someone dear near or even knowing what you’re going though. Your only company, two armed correctional officers and the two medical personnel of the ambulance. Left leg (shackled to a gurney) and watching strangers walk past you. A clarity moment of life and possibility of death.</br></br>
 
Due to the pandemic, contact visiting has been suspended. Thirty-minute video chats has been implemented for once a month. Although appointments are rare, I’ve been waiting for months. As I write this letter, (yep) writing in an email or text era, mail we receive from outside world coming in takes a minimum of two weeks and that’s being lenient.</br></br> 

Lack of visitation and lack of mail is depressing, frustrating, helpless. Policy is set up as the pandemic continues and policy is subject to change any moment. Regarding which cell you move to, when you can work to support yourself with a Prison Industry Authority job.</br></br>

I pray in the near future the pandemic has given experiences that are learned from and protocols that make sense are implemented. In the meantime, I remain occupying my mind with reading, correspondence courses, and exercising the body regularly. As well as praying to maintain spiritual strength to cope with this crisis.</br></br>
 
This missive is my reality. Random thoughts are expressed. Thank you for lending an ear to my venting. Take care, be safe, remain vigilant with precautions.
