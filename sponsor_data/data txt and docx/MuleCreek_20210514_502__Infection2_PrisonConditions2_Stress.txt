This story was told by a person incarcerated at Mule Creek.</br></br>

UCI: How have you been coping with everything going on?</br></br>

Caller: Well, my girl definitely, she writes me. JPay allows, JPay is the organization that allows loved ones, people out there to email loved ones behind bars to stay connected through this pandemic. So, she was able to email me more often and she was just giving me emotional support. Man, I gotta give it to her, she was there for me since day one. That and reading, just doing my studies. That’s how I get through it, you know, stay busy.</br></br>

UCI: What do you think would’ve made the situation at your facility better?</br></br>

Caller: I think if they were to have a plan from the, it don’t seem like they had a plan from the gate or a contingency plan. It just seemed like wherever a guy tested positive they just threw him to another building, speaking like it was gonna serve him better but it affects the next cell.</br></br>

Well, what they should’ve done is once an inmate tested positive, just like quarantine him in that cell with his cellies instead of moving him to another building or another pod when his old cellies that he was living in could’ve caught it and shared it with other people on the yard or in the building.</br></br>

So, they were kind of backward. I didn’t understand, I didn’t understand what they were doing. Everybody said it was, like, I don’t know, a conspiracy, things going on, whatever it could be but they handled it very poorly.</br></br>

UCI: What else do you want people to know?</br></br>

Caller: [unintelligible] …at that point. San Quentin, my cousin died from COVID. He only had one year to do. He went to San Quentin serving one year and he got COVID and he died. He was there for a nonviolent, you know…</br></br>

UCI: Wow.</br></br>

Caller: He was a nonviolent offender. And then, so it not only impacted me and him, of course, but my family as well, you know, because… I’m sorry, what was your question? I didn’t mean to interrupt.
