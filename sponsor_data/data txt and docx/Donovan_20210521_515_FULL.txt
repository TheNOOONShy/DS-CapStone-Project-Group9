This story was told by a person incarcerated at Donovan.</br></br>


UCI: You can start whenever you’d like.</br></br>


Caller: Can you repeat that?</br></br>


UCI: You can, like, start whenever you’d like, or tell me whatever you want to share about your story.</br></br>


Caller: Well, what I wanna share about my story was that they brought an inmate here that was infected with COVID, and we wasn’t exposed to it until they brought him here. And they knew that he had COVID, and we all winded up catching COVID. Me, myself, catched--caught COVID because they didn’t have the proper safety procedures here. And now this guy that has COVID been walking around us and being around us, instead of having him isolated. So it was spreading, around us, and we was all infected.</br></br>


UCI: Oh wow.</br></br>


Caller: And I couldn’t--I had problems breathing, I had problems, I had all the symptoms of COVID. And I tried to explain that to the medical staff, and they really didn’t provide me anything. And then we was threatened with write-ups and stuff like that if we didn’t comply to their moves, ‘cause they was trying to move us around and all that. I was sick with COVID.</br></br>


UCI: Was that recent?</br></br>


Caller: Yes, um, well I had it in December. That’s when it spread here at R.J. Donovan. Well, on the yard I was on.</br></br>


UCI: Oh, wow, that’s not good.</br></br>


Caller: Excuse me?</br></br>


UCI: Yeah, I was just saying that’s not good, that situation.</br></br>


Caller: No, it wasn’t good at all because right now we’re still suffering. A lot of us still haven’t seen our families, you know, still, still got us kind of isolated. Like, an hour visit, hour FaceTime, on a monitor visit. You gotta set an appointment, so you know, if you don’t get that opportunity to get that appointment, you won’t see your loved one.</br></br>


UCI: That’s really hard. Um, what have you been doing to cope?</br></br>


Caller: Me, myself, um, you know, I created some programs here on this yard. So I’ve been trying to stay [unintelligible], stay working out, and just stay tryna--you know, you stay busy.</br></br>


UCI: Oh, that’s good.</br></br>


Caller: So I been trying to do that, I took the shots and all. I still feel a little symptoms from when I had the COVID. ‘Cause you know, I have headaches sometimes, my breathing will go in and out sometimes.</br></br>


UCI: That’s not good.</br></br>


Caller: Yeah, so they--then they wrote a lot of us up because they said we refused to move, because they put a lot of money into the gym. A lot of guys didn’t want to move into the gym because it’s putting us more in harm’s way. I mean, you’re putting us with more infected people and all that, so they wrote us--they disciplined every--you know, they wrote us up.</br></br>


UCI: Oh, that’s--wow. Was there--</br></br>


Caller: It affects a lot of us. They wrote us to say we refused to move, when we was just trying to explain to them that we don’t wanna move into a situation where, you know, we was about to get off of it, ‘cause you already got us on quarantine already, but you trying to put us around people who are just starting out on COVID, and you know, you recatch it again. And which, they didn’t understand that.</br></br>


UCI: Was, like, were there a lot of people infected at your facility?</br></br>


Caller: No, just, it was like in my section. It started off with one person, and then my whole section winded up getting infected, so they had us isolate. Like, they shutted us in quarantine.</br></br>


UCI: Oh wow.</br></br>


Caller: And so, then they had us separated from everybody else. But then, you know, they got panicked ‘cause I guess they didn’t know what to do and all that, so they put money into the gym, and just tried to move us in the gym. But none of us was tryna do that, it’s like “is everybody prepared or not?” so let’s try to throw us somewhere with no safety or nothing.</br></br>


UCI: Yeah. Has the situation gotten any better recently or is it still not good?</br></br>


Caller: Well, after we wind up catching COVID and all that, then they start giving us real--start giving us masks, and now they wanna start giving us cleaning utensils and stuff like that. You know, now, it got a little better now: we can wipe stuff down, but we already been there, done that, with the COVID.</br></br>


UCI: Oh. Um--</br></br>


Caller: We’re waiting for the--we’re still waiting for our visits, we’re still waiting for, you know, for other programs and stuff to come back our way, I mean, we still--It’s like everything’s going slow.</br></br>


UCI: So what do you think could’ve made the situation better?</br></br>


Caller: If they never would’ve brought the guy here.</br></br>


UCI: Yeah.</br></br>


Caller: You know somebody’s got--I mean why would you put somebody around people that’s not infected? I mean, you know, it’s like they didn’t care. You put us all in harm’s way when you put somebody here that’s got COVID, nobody else had it.</br></br>


UCI: Yeah, that doesn’t make a whole lot of sense that they would do that.</br></br>


Caller: ‘Cause here on this yard we got microwaves, we have different stuff, phones and all that, and we all use the same things.</br></br>


UCI: And when that happened, they weren’t, like, sanitizing or giving you anything to clean?</br></br>


Caller: No, and we got no sanitizer, what’s going on was no, um--the guy was able to walk around us, use the microwave, he had access to everything we had access to.</br></br>


UCI: Oh.</br></br>


Caller: Until it was too late. Until it was too late, they wind up moving him out of here, but he was already--they had left him here like a week or something. And he already had COVID. You know, it was too late. We were already exposed already by the time they moved him out of here.</br></br>


UCI: Yeah, I get that. That’s not good.</br></br>


Caller: And then they wrote me up. I sent a copy of--I wrote a letter to y’all, and I sent a copy of what took place and everything, so I hope y’all get it.</br></br>


UCI: Yeah, I think they’re going through letters today, they got a lot of letters yesterday and today, so they’re going through those.</br></br>


Caller: Yeah, so, um, it’s just not a good situation and I’m just taking it one day at a time.</br></br>


UCI: Well, hopefully it starts to get better as people get the vaccine and all of that.</br></br>


Caller: Okay.</br></br>


UCI: Do you have anything else you’d like to share?</br></br>


Caller: I just wanna say that hopefully, you know, to be more--I appreciate what you guys are doing, I hope it gets more attention that people in here died in here, people was real sick and they never recovered from this situation.</br></br>


UCI: Yeah, that’s our goal, we wanna bring attention to it.</br></br>


Caller: You know, people need to see their families, people need to, you know, get back connected with their loved ones and everything.</br></br>


UCI: Uh huh, I totally understand that.</br></br>


Caller: A lot of people lost their wives, their family and everything due to not being able to see them.</br></br>


UCI: Yeah.</br></br>


Caller: I worry--You know, they had--people had to get tested before they even come see you. Seventy-two hours, they have to swab ‘em again, you know, it’s a headache to try to get a visit.</br></br>


UCI: Wow, that’s a lot of work to get one hour visit. Hopefully--</br></br>


Caller: Yeah, that’s true.</br></br>


UCI: --it starts to get better.</br></br>


Caller: I, well, I pray that it do. I hope that it gets better. So will I hear from y’all soon, or how would that work?</br></br>


UCI: Yeah, they’re sending follow-up letters this week and next week, so you should probably get one like, maybe by next week.</br></br>


Caller: Well, I sent my letter out today, so it should be there with my information I put in there.</br></br>


UCI: Okay, yeah, then you should probably get an email from them maybe by the end of next week.</br></br>


Caller: Okay, and I got other people that I’ll pass along that had COVID and everything, and get in contact too. To reach out, call, or write.</br></br>


UCI: Okay, yeah. They could write or call, we’re here Monday through Friday from five to nine.</br></br>


Caller: Okay. I appreciate that. We appreciate y’all getting the word out that, you know, that we human too.</br></br>


UCI: Yeah.</br></br>


Caller: Just ‘cause we’re here don’t mean we’re not human.</br></br>


UCI: Yeah.</br></br>


Caller: We deserve, like, treatment or something too. Like medical attention and all that.


UCI: Definitely.</br></br>


Caller: And I appreciate that, I know you can’t--you don’t say so much, but do you know that was me?</br></br>


UCI: What?</br></br>


Caller: I appreciate your time.</br></br>


UCI: Yeah, thank you for calling and participating.</br></br>


Caller: Okay, and you have a good, blessed day.</br></br>


UCI: Thank you, you too.</br></br>


Caller: Alright, you take it easy.</br></br>


UCI: Bye.</br></br>


Caller: Alright.</br></br>
