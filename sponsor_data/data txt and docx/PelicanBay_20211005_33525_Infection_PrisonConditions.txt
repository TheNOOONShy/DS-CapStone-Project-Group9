This story was told by a person incarcerated at Pelican Bay.</br></br>

UCI: How has the COVID situation been like at your facility?</br></br>

Caller: Well, it's basically, it's been — there's been an outbreak. Right? It's been an outbreak in the prison since last May — since May of 2020. You know what I'm saying? And, basically, a large number of officers had tested positive. You know what I'm saying?</br></br>

And the officers had to come into work and, basically, infect the inmates. You know what I'm saying? Because it's located — is kind of located in a small, rural area. You know what I'm saying?</br></br>

UCI: Yes.</br></br>

Caller: So the — so a lot of the officers are coming in here and pretty much infect the inmates. You know what I'm saying? And, since May of - since may of last year, I think like 400 officers have tested positive. And like about 300 inmates have tested positive.</br></br>

UCI: Oh, wow.</br></br>

Caller: You know what I'm saying? Yeah. You know what I'm saying? And but, when you think about it, the number is a small number.</br></br> 

But, since this is a real, you know, this is a real small area up here, 400 people testing positive, it's kind of a big thing. You know what I'm saying? Because the area — direct area around the prison is real small. You know what I'm saying?</br></br>

UCI: Yeah. Definitely.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah. So, basically — you know what I'm saying — it's actually been an outbreak, since May of last year. You know what I'm saying? And then, you got the delta variant.</br></br> 

You know what I'm saying? It's like over the last two months, it's been a delta outbreak in here, too, though. You know what I'm saying?</br></br>

It's been a large spike in here. You know what I'm saying? And then, you got a lot of officers that were saying that they were going to refuse to take the vaccine. You know what I'm saying?</br></br> 

A lot of officers saying that they're going to refuse to take the vaccine. But they still come to work, though. You know what I'm saying? You know what I mean?</br></br>

UCI: Yeah. That's definitely not good.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah.</br></br>

UCI: How has the vaccination situation been for the inmates?</br></br>

Caller: See, they were supposed to test once a week. Right? But the only people that are really being tested are the people that are unvaccinated. You know what I'm saying?</br></br> 

So the people that are vaccinated are not being tested, though. You know what I'm saying? So we really don't know the true number of the breakthrough cases.</br></br> 

You know what I'm saying? The breakthrough cases—we really don't know. Because people that are vaccinated are not being tested. You know what I'm saying?
