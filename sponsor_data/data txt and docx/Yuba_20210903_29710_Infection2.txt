UCI: Wow, and what about the vaccine situation?</br></br>

Caller: The vaccines, they are currently offering $50 on the inmate's funds if they agree to take the COVID-19 Janssen vaccine. It's I guess the Janssen. It's not the Johnson and Johnson, it says Janssen. And they're giving us $50 for being vaccinated if we so choose to be vaccinated.</br></br>

UCI: Oh, okay, I see. Well, do you think you'll be taking the vaccine?</br></br>

Caller: I've already had been administered the vaccine, and other fellow peers that have had the vaccine administered as well have contracted COVID. So, this vaccine is not sufficient to everybody and what not. It's not going to make it to where you can't contract COVID.
