This letter was written by a person incarcerated at CMC (California Men’s Colony).</br> </br>

Hello,</br></br>

My name is [redacted], and dealing with the pandemic has literally been a nightmare with claustrophobic feelings. I have been repeatedly quarantined now since December 7th, going on my third month with today being the 9th of February.</br></br>

I can’t get any help nor response from the medical staff on why they keep starting my quarantine over after I’ve been tested negative nine to 10 times since the start. Every Monday since December 7th, they do test, which my results have returned negative over and over, But I’m still quarantined and unable to call my family.</br></br>

While those who have contracted COVID go into a 10-day quarantine and are released back into normal program, work, yard, and phone calls.</br></br>

These people are totally violating COVID-19 protocols. I was able to receive the first shot of Moderna vaccine, after needing to bang the door for assistance.</br></br>

I was literally the last person receiving the vaccine, even after I’m still not allowed out of my cell.</br></br>

I have filed numerous 602 complaints, only to be rejected within a 24-hour response.</br></br>

So, yes, being in this prison testing negative for COVID is tormenting. They only give program to the people that contracted the virus.</br></br>

Unfair and inhumane treatment lives in CMC. Read slow and picture me writing a letter with hand ailments and back spinal pain and get no help from medical.</br></br>

P.S. I literally fear for my safety, with staff cracking jokes like, “It’s better to just catch COVID.”</br></br>

Unable to see or speak to my family causes me anxiety attacks, that of which I was rushed to medical January 2021. </br></br>

I have to continuously pray that I’ll make it back to those that love me.
