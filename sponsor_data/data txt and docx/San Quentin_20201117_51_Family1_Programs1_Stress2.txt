This letter was written by a person incarcerated at San Quentin.</br></br>

What has it been like to have reduced visitations from family and friends. Well, this one is easy. San Quentin has completely stopped all visitation from family and friends since the pandemic began. So, no, no prisoners have visited any family members or friends.</br></br> 

The only people I see around here are corrections staff, some with masks and some without masks, nurses in hazmat suits, and those here serving of security because all other preventative measures are not possible in this and other prison facilities. The parole board holds hearings through video feed or phone calls, even attorneys. No one comes into the prison to visit.</br></br> 

It is sad because it affects everyone mentally and emotionally. A 15-minute collect call doesn’t do it for me and the hardship that comes with using the twelve phones in a unit that houses over 800 plus people.</br></br> 

How have I been coping with this crisis? This one is hard, because I really don’t know. All I have been doing is sleeping more, receiving out of cell time for about one hour and thirty minutes every other day for yard, a collect phone call and a shower that only has twelve shower heads along with about 200 other men here at the same time. This in itself should be illegal.</br></br> 

I read and study about some things and write. I have been trying to prepare myself for my next board hearing one day in parole suitability. I pray and I do have hope for a better day, I hope to be in a better place, I hope to be with my family and loved ones, I hope to be free in every sense of the word, but all I can do is hope.</br></br> 

All I can do is try and have positive thoughts about my situation. It is hard talking to my family over the collect call phone system here and then just walking away to who knows where in this prison. I guess what keeps me going is the faith in God that I have even though this system has no feelings.</br></br> 

Just imagine, we as a people created this system and it will take us a people to fix it. I don’t think anything is wrong with jails, institutions or prisons, the problem is how we use them.
