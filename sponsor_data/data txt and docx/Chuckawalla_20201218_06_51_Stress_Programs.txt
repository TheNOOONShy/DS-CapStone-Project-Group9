This story was told by a person incarcerated at Chuckawalla.</br></br>UCI: I think it’s so important that you’re sharing your testimony. And is there anything you’ve done while, you know, things have been going on, is there anything you’ve done personally to be able to cope with, you know, a possible outbreak, for yourself?</br></br>  Caller: Okay. Well for this, for the COVID, I keep track - I listen to the news, I listen to what the scientists says. Most of the problem, most of the problems, the issues come with underlying health issues that people have. The biggest one is overweight, with obesity, and all the other underlying, you know, that they create.</br></br> 

High blood pressure, or diabetes, or even just high, you know, high AC1. They are the people who are most vulnerable to, especially COVID. So, I have kept myself as fit as possible, I don’t eat half the junk food that is available through the canteen, or some of the food that they serve to us, that I think is not very healthy. And I exercise as much as possible.</br></br> 

I walk at least, seven miles, at least seven miles up to 15 miles a day, every day. And I do exercise as well. So, I’m keeping myself fit and healthy to protect myself from against such things as the virus. And I’m, maybe that’s why it didn’t affect me as much as it affected others.</br></br>  UCI: Yeah. Do you feel like - do you feel like going outside has also helped, maybe, not affect you instead of staying indoors all the time?</br></br>  Caller: I believe we should have more yard time than they give us because, again when the pandemic, they seem to lock us all in the buildings, whereas we should be out there in the fresh air. But the trouble is, the people want to play games like contact sports, which ruins the, you got to break the social distancing common sense.</br></br> 

So, it's the mentality of the inmates. That, if everybody just stood outside or walked around social distanced, it would be much healthier for everybody.
