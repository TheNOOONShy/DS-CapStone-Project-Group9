This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Fresno Mendota Federal Center.</br></br>

Hi there, well I got your letter a few days ago and was thinking, that it is a good thing you guys are doing. So thank you.</br></br>

I am one of many people that are going to be out soon. I have only got a violation of two years but I had started a term for county or state in 2019 on the 11th month so I have been locked up the whole time all this stuff has been going on. Really at first I didn’t think anything about it, then people were getting out of jail, with six months to their release date. My own brother got out with 63 days to go and I was shocked to see that happen.</br></br>

I am not that lucky. I still had fed time to look forward to and the feds don’t just let you out or not that I have seen. I heard that it was bad in the federal prisons, with everyone getting it. I have seen how bad the health system is in here.</br></br>

I just got done doing 10 years in California federal system for drugs and guns. And in that time I have seen people die from lack of medical help. So I was thinking this really is going to be a really rough two years. I have been trying to get to the place that I am going to do my time at for or should I say since I got my federal time.</br></br>

That is eight months give or take a few days.</br></br>

They have keep us from our families and I have gone across state and then back to California to the holding in Victorville for quarantine again. This place Mendota is the worse so far, because I am here to do my time and there are others that are doing their time still locked up in this unit going on six weeks and not let out to use the phone or out to the yard to get some air.</br></br>

This is the yard we are to be at and there is no reason that we can’t go out to the yard, but lack of people doing their job and we can see it every day here. They have a job to do and it seems like they don’t want to do anything but sit around and get a paycheck.</br></br>

Most of the time medical don’t do anything for you at all, but try to give you a shot for the vaccine even when there is no need for it. I have already had the COVID-19 flu, but it was nothing. No smell or taste. That is all I had. Now I have to get the shot or they are never going to let me out of this holding or at least that is what it feels like.</br></br>

So I hope that I helped someone and if you like you can get back at me again. Thanks again.
