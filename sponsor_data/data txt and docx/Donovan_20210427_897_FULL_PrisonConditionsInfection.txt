Hello PrisonPandemic,</br></br>

To whomever refines this letter. Well let me first start off my introducing myself. I'm currently serving a 15 year sentence. I only need 10 more years to go.</br></br>

Well first off let me start by saying everything people see about prison in movies are staged. Here in general population there is rules, politics, as one will say. So for that reason I would want to be anonymous. Here in Richard Donovan I think we all contacted the COVID-19 in Februaryish 2020.</br></br>

The reason I say this is many inmates had the "flu." That's what the nurses labeled it as, only to find out that COVID-19 hadn't existed yet.</br></br>

So being property of the state we all got vaccinated before everyone even got the first shot. I been having both shots for almost two months now. I normally wouldn't take the shots but it was mandatory for our race to take it due to us having a mafia member on the yard.</br></br>

Pretty much what they say, we do. Me being a gang member I follow under the umbrella that I must obey their orders of command. That's politics. Each race has their own structure in prison, Hispanics are known to have the most discipline and organize structure.</br></br>

So before COVID-19 they allowed us to have visits. Here they were usually hours long. Wow that we're under the purple tier they didn't allow any type of outsider enter the prison.</br></br>

In all reality the only way we're able to contact the virus is from the C.O.'s or the staff, they live outside the gates. I'm not sure the protocol or how they get vaccinated. But many still come in contact with the virus.</br></br>

They now allow us to have contact with other buildings. We're on phase two where all top tier can come out to yard recreation. They still haven't let programs in the prison so we pretty have no access to email outsiders into them to receive credits to parole quicker.</br></br>

Through all of these lockdowns people complain about being home with nothing to do, imagine being in prison and can't go out. Haha, so remember always tell your love ones that you love them and give them all your love. So I send mine through this letter.</br></br>

COVID high five! Bye! Be safe.
