To whom it may concern, well since the pandemic started and the COVID-19 virus has been spreading, it’s been scary for me cause I don’t want to catch the virus and get sick and die from it. The correctional officers are the ones that bring it in the prison and they act like we brought it into the prison. They tell us to wear our masks and we do, but most correctional officers don’t wear them and because of that, the virus spreads, and we have to pay for that. We go on lockdown for quarantine to slow or stop the spread. We don’t get visits. They barely run store, and we can’t get the medical help we need provided by the state.</br></br>

And it’s unfair to us. I want to get visits with my kids, but they can’t come up here to Tehachapi because they’re not running it. My aunt died because of the Coronavirus, I didn’t even get to talk to her and I’m scared for my grandma. I’m stressed out.</br></br>

Sometimes suicide runs through my mind. I ask for help from the mental health and they don’t care what we go through. It seems like they just want their paycheck.
