This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Mule Creek.</br></br>


Hello PrisonPandemic and good evening.</br></br>


I am 66 years old and I have been kept away from society since 1979. So please excuse anything I may say or take offense to or even personal. I thank you personally for your “thoughtfulness,” and yes “concern,” for prisoners who will reply with their individual answers and stories to your “questions.”</br></br>


It is faith strengthening for those “locked-away” knowing that the few such as “yourselves” who take the “time-effort,” to show “compassion” and “interest” for today’s incarcerated. Let me first say that, quoting James 1:17, “every good gift and every perfect present is from above, coming down from the father of the celestial lights, who does not vary or change like the shifting shadows.”</br></br>


So this is how I view your letter… as something “good.” At a time that gave me “encouragement” and some “comfort,” always from our father who provides. Your “most-kind” and “generous” letter is not a “coincidence.”</br></br>


Why? Because I’ve been mediating and pondering-on, hoping that I would soon hear from someone in that area-where you’re located-at!</br></br>


Before ending up inside, I lived across the street from the YMCA. I also lived at the back end of a junior high school. I went there as a young teen and my younger brother went to an elementary and my older brother went to a high school.</br></br>


I left when he and his wife had a son and a daughter… Both grown and have families of their own. His wife, son, and daughter. It’s a small world isn’t it?!</br></br>


Especially “now” with the “scientific-technology.” There’s no secrets or place you can hide anymore… Technology insists that even your private thoughts should be heard and seen…</br></br>


I look back on my 66 years of “existing” on this earth and you as a college student of secular knowledge should already come to realisation. That nothing has changed. Moderation in man’s genius sure has grown…</br></br>


But human condition, i.e. human nature has gotten even moreso, more prone to “violence.” And as gore takes care of the earth… only “ruining” it!</br></br>


I’m not in “fear” as many are. I do-not lack the “wisdom” or “tools” to deeply-understand the “critical times” that each human-being is going through. Today’s “war” is this “disease” that mankind daily is waking-up to and going to sleep to. This bears witness to what doctor Luke was inspired to record at Luke 21:11… “no story is too small” you quoted from the photo copied letter.</br></br>


I once saw a old black and white movie… Robert Blake played a role of a person found guilty of first degree-murder. As a young-man I still remember his last words on his last walk to his death. Being escorted by the prison-guard’s, he stood there between them, looked around and said, “who do I apologize to?!”</br></br>


So I say to you PrisonPandemic… what do I say in answer to your questions? Does this help… Two cases of COVID-19 were first recorded at C.I.M. Do you remember?!</br></br>


Well, the C.D.C. officer in charge of “transportation” shipped a bus-load of prisoners from that prison, C.I.M., to San Quentin prison. End result, San Quentin was completely-infected via COVID-19!!! Here’s the point… you would think that “basically” prisoners would stand a better chance of not getting the virus, especially those on “death row!!!”</br></br>


The most secluded human-beings on earth!!! 1st degree-murder!!! Injustice by those who are corrupt and manipulate any situation. To their advantage!!!</br></br>


Soon, every human being here tested positive for COVID-19… up to a total of 12-deaths! Only because of the close proximity and mandated-order forced C.D.C. to vaccinate prisoners first even before those on the outside got to be vaccinated which you're all aware of!!!</br></br>


Was that out of a humanitarian-effect?! Possibly by the moral majority! I think they had no-other-choice!</br></br>


That or release every-one or single-cell every prisoner! No money there is there?! So, just like political-wars, that human governments make money from, at the expense of human-lives, they are now using this disease as the money-machine, “man dominating man to his injury!”</br></br>


The way out and a form of “peace” that helps even prisoners, is that those who qualify, i.e. who have a social security number, can have some stimulus checks that give them a opportunity to buy the things that C.D.C. allows through packages, canteen, helpout their families and even some are generous to share with cellies and those less-fortunate in here! The prisoners who have social-security numbers, but can’t remember them are not able to put in fee these “monies”… As the tax-man won’t send any “if” as you know, do not have a correct SSN#.</br></br>


These people here will-not help, i.e. “custody.” I personally can’t remember my SSN# and I do have one. I was born in New York on October 1955. My mother and father were married in New York City!</br></br>


I am a United-States citizen!!! When I asked my counselor for my SSN#, she said I didn’t have one and that I was on record as not being a United States citizen!!! That’s how safe I’ve felt since this pandemic!!!</br></br>


Last Sunday I went to sleep and I woke up with the whole back of my neck with at least second-degree burns! My right foot was discolored and very swollen! My whole body all-night-long was like I was on fire!!!</br></br>


So hot. That I woke-up “burnt-up!” I have a burn-scar on the back of my neck and on my bottom-foot!</br></br>


The doctor took some blood tests, “said” I would get some kind of “ointment” for the burns on neck and foot. But three-days later… nothing! I’ve been in worse-conditions through-out my “prison-life.” Outside help after many-years can sometimes be complicated.</br></br>


This is why I was glad to hear from your office of interests… it’s a small world. Would it be possible if maybe you could use your “resources” to help me locate my family who still may live in [redacted] and send me their address or phone number? I’m sure their phone number is in the phone book?</br></br>


I’m just trying to locate my SSN# and I’m sure that they can help me get-it, or, if you can give me any help on assisting-me getting my SSN#?! If there’s any office that I can contact by letter and give them some identification to prove who I am?! I know that this may sound strange to you, but I’ve been locked up so long, that I’ve never needed the SSN# till now.</br></br>


I would like to receive some stimulus monies that I can receive as a prisoner legally. If there’s anything you can help me out with in achieving this, it would be of great relief in my present situation.</br></br>


If not and I don’t expect you should as that is not why you contacted-me for. So I apologize if I’ve crossed any boundaries, sincerely.</br></br>


Other than this frustrating problem, I am happy for those who can have some contact personally with loved-ones! You can sense and hear their daily conversations, how happy they are now seeing those who care for them!!!</br></br>


I’m personally doing spiritually, physically, mentally, emotionally, well! When I see on the news daily how “earth-wide” the famines, food shortages, earthquakes, prevalent violence, damage the earth is also going through, are going to go through, I mourn for those who are suffering through these “last of the last days!”</br></br>


Our only hope is in what Daniel 2:44 says, the kingdom which we pray-for. Matthew 6:9-10, is the only answer. Man does not have the wisdom, or, power, to bring permanent-peace to the earth, or, end the suffering we are all going through!</br></br>


That is why our Heavenly father whose name is Jehovah, the almighty, has provided a earthly-organization the “Watch Tower and Tract Society” to go out and protect the human family with “accurate knowledge” of the good news of His will!!! When any human-being desires true-peace and is tired of being lied to by those who claim to have the answers to life’s big questions… When they are humbled by everyday occurrences, that human rulers can’t seem to solve. They then call-upon the name of Jehovah who is the only one who can “save” them.</br></br>


Romans 10:13, then like me, as well as over 600 people each week. Earth-wide who studied the Bible with Jehovah’s witnesses, have made confident peace with Jehovah God and now are supporters to our king and leader. Christ Jesus as the one who is enthroned as king of king and lord of lords! Rev. 11:15.</br></br>


Ecclesiastes 1:2 says, “‘the greatest futility!’ Says the congreator. ‘The greatest futility! Everything is futile!’”</br></br>


Verse 14 continues, “I saw all the works that were done under the sun, and look! Everything was futile. A chasing after the wind.”</br></br>


As long as our adversary, Satan the Devil is Ruler of Manhood, John 12:31 there will never be any “peace” until he is abyssed. Revelation 20:1-3, no matter what man tries to do, i.e. reform, change, it is not permanent and although the intent by some of a “moral majority” such as yourselves, is by nature loving your neighbor, true change of personality, character, and conduct, begins by learning accurate knowledge of truth. Colossians 3:5-10!!!</br></br>


If you ever as a student of secular-knowledge, who I sense is a mostly man of honest intent, seek life sustaining knowledge and as a free-moral agent want to pursue the “better future” Jehovah has invited you to be a part of, the new earth, Revelation 21:1-5.</br></br>


If this appeals to your sense of justice, love and wisdom, then I encourage you to download [redacted] and ask them to send you a simple, clarifying book, “What Does the Bible Really Teach.”</br></br>


Give your-self the choice to see if Jehovah’s organization is the only religious-organization, that he is using to represent him on-earth?! What do you have to lose? You seem to be intelligent.</br></br>


See if what “Jehovahs witnesses” are speaking is the accurate knowledge of the Bible?! I’ve seen it all… Corruption, injusticce, murder, even suicide, officers and inmates!!! No-hope no-way-out!!!</br></br>


Jehovah God is mankind's only answer. He created us and with Him, there is no-pain. He knows what’s best for us and as long as we learn to know Him, trust in Him then you will have true peace and be a part of the humane. 2 Corinthians 6:14-18. And all political ruleships, Revelation 16:14-16.</br></br>


In Matthew 25:31-46, Jesus spoke of “survivors” of Armageddon. Daniel 12:1, spoke of these “survivors.” Also Revelation 7:9, “great crowd.” Proverbs 3:1, two, three, four, five.</br></br>


Ecclesiastes 3:14 also adds, “I have come to know that everything the true God makes will endure forever. There is nothing to add to it and nothing to subtract from it. The true God has made it this way, so that people will fear him.”</br></br>


Ecclesiastes 12:13 says, “the conclusion of the matter, everything having been heard is: fear the true God and keep his commandments, for this is the whole obligation of man.” That’s the point!!!</br></br>


In your letter, you said you’re collecting these stories to “preserve” them in an “archive” for historical-purposes with the “goal” that they could help lead to positive-reforms. Just within this year alone, in this prison, there have been three murders. I can’t even number the “assaults.”</br></br>


Everyday there is a “cell-conflict.” Even some taking serious-steps of committing suicide, because they felt there was no-other way out or taking a sharp-object and cutting themselves to get the attention they needed, because staff don’t want to stop, listen, try and fix the problem.</br></br>


Hunger strikes, the extreme measure to those who will take those “measure” and force those in charge to do what needed to be done and bring “relief,” when it shouldn’t have had to go that distance from the start!!!</br></br>


Human beings who go through each-day never knowing what can happen moment by moment trying to erase their pain, shame, guilt, in anything pleasurable that satisfies their “desires.” Seeking “peace” and trying to soothe their “consciences.”</br></br>


Predators walking around full of “emotion,” lacking the “intellect” to help them to deal with prejudice, racism, materialism, patriotism, greed, selfishness, created with a “sexual-impulse.” Denied a maternal release by marriage and with someone you respect and love and want to enjoy that intimate act, as sexual beings.</br></br>


Turning to the illusion of someone who changed the appearance they were made in, and groping for some affection and intimacy in a false-hood. Those who participate in any of that activity cause themselves constant-pain. The drama of that “world” is like a dog chasing its tail. A vicious-cycle of self-inflicted-pain!!!</br></br>


In one-form or another, a “victim,” raped by the system, the board wants the human-being to learn the two back ends of life!!! One, have you learned to submit to “authority” and obey them. Two, have you learned to respect the value of life.</br></br>


Here’s a story for your archives. A man off of “death-row” county jail, searching for some “relief” through the “courts.” He wasn’t like the rest of the “prisoners,” per say homie.</br></br>


Regular, when somebody is not of the “mold,” you’re treated as a “out-cast,” different, just like what the earthly-population goes through everyday. He lived two-cells from me. Had gotten into practicing how to “self-hypnotize” him-self!!!</br></br>


I was cooking sandwiches one-night, saved up cheese and bologna from the “lunch.” This human-being that night called over to me and asked me if I had or could I send him something to eat. I could “sense” his request registered by those around me and I could feel the “beast” breathing its foul stench of “hate,” “dislike,” and I let that ugly aroma make me to deny that human-being the decency-dignity of comfort of giving to his need of human law or respect!!!</br></br>


I said no! That same night, hours later, he absolutely took his own-life! Hanging himself from the vent.</br></br>


Just think, if I had been strong enough to not allow myself to be trapped by the “noem?!” Do we always do the right-thing?! I’ve come to know that it is easy to be a coward.</br></br>


The train of our “errors” upon ourselves and upon others, you can’t change or undo, but, I’ve learned, that true peace can only come by making peace with our creator Jehovah. When we are so tired of the January through December monotonous-redundancy that mankind treads too.</br></br>


Then, we reach out for the “real-life.” 1 Timothy 6:17-19. No more “pain,” “anxiety,” “weary,” “death,” or what causes death! This peaceful-picture is what Jehovah “promises” and intends to do for His creation, us, human beings who naturally crave permanent peace, no-more suffering, Revelation 21:1-5.</br></br>


We even pray for God’s will to be done on earth as it is in Heaven! Matt. 6:10, peace, that thousand years of restoration on earth is very, very, near. You’re being invited to learn that “truth.” That is a “goal” you are absolutely guaranteed to inherit, Matthew 5:5, I humbly respect your intentions to try and better this prison-system and help those who have been “seduced” by greed and free-commodity.</br></br>


Merchants of everyday commercialism prey on mankind’s lust for power and money and the end-result is the earth being full of its corpses of human beings who are victimized by false-religion and political elements of rulership.</br></br>


I can guarantee to you one thing, man does not have the wisdom, power, or, wisdom of mind, to bring complete-peace to this world. They can, best they only look after their own interests.</br></br>


If Jehovah has not yet in His patience, brought a end to Satan’s rulership by abyssing Him after “Armageddon,” and you read the accumulated stories men made in God’s image will send you in that reformed-future you are looking for and may see in your lifetime. I absolutely positively guarantee, that nothing will have changed or gotten better than it is now!!!</br></br>


Different rulerships, political rules have come and gone. Where is the change? I see the true-panic in people’s eyes, body language, voice, when they wake-up each day to mass-shootings, prejudice, killings, suicides, environmental catastrophes, and they are numbed, dazed, because they don’t have the “answers.”</br></br>


Only Jehovah’s “earthly organization.” The “Watchtower and Tract Society” on website, can you find all the “answers” you may be looking for!!! If I have been of any-use by this exhausting-letter and if I’ve said anything of value, or, benefit, to be of any insight to help you “perceive” what I know from experience, then use it on your personal-life and even on the website. I do-not know if my “story” is what you or your colleagues had in-mind.</br></br>


I deeply appreciate your honest hearted work and just maybe, I have helped you, or, anyone else “gain” from a old-man’s true-perspective, of what is “truth.” May the God of peace, answer your prayers and draw you close to Him! James 4:7-10. Thank you for any “help” you may assist me in, after all it’s a small world.</br></br>


Thank you for your time! Sincerely.</br></br>


P.S. Pity = an action, to bring relief. Matthew 20:34. I will call very soon at # you gave. Talk to you later.
