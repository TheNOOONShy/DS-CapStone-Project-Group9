This letter was written by a person incarcerated at California City.</br></br>Hello PrisonPandemic,</br></br> As I allow pen to meet paper, I hope and pray upon you receiving this letter it finds you in the best of health and spirit. Especially during this time of COVID-19. This past year has been different once in a lifetime experience. Thanking God that I am here with the ability to respond to your letter.</br></br>Feeling somewhat surprised that with the large number of those within the CDCR website you and your associates had chosen me. Thank you, yes, a total surprise. I am as well a college student attending community college here at the California City facility. This has been a lifesaver during this current time.</br></br>As you, the correspondence part has played a big part of what we call cell time. Carrying a full schedule of classes, actually six classes per semester and two in the summer session, starting the spring of 2021 with five. All of the while I am proud to see that I have a GPA of 3.75. Achievements of the Associates in Psychology, Art, and Humanities, Anthropology, and Social Science Behavior.</br></br>Thanking CDCR for this opportunity allowing me to take advantage in a positive direction making the best of the current situation. Knowing that this will benefit myself, and family in the future. Current plans to continue my education at the next level so that I will be able to give back to my community youth.</br></br>COVID-19 has had us shut down. We are in two men cells, giving us that break from mainstream programs. For during this time, I sit back and relax. I have plenty underlying conditions. All I can do is follow the guidelines, social distance, wash hands, and keep the mask in place.</br></br>I have lost precious time with visiting with my daughter, grandchildren, ex-wife, and ex-mother (who is now is resting with the angels in heaven) one of those who lost her life to COVID-19 on Christmas. I am understanding more about life, and I am accepting life on these life terms.</br></br>Today I am drug free going to college, the opposite of the man I used to be. I have learned to channel my anger. My tool bag has all sort of coping skills and mechanisms for understanding. This brief insight of who I am. If interested to continue this journey with me I will eagerly await your response. Again, thank you for taking your time to reach out.</br></br>Best Wishes. God Bless.
