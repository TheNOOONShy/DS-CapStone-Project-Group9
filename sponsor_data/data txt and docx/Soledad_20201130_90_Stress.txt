I'm an older prisoner with underlying conditions. And like many others my age we are worried that CDCR is gambling with our lives for the sake of money. The more COVID cases they have here, the longer they can extend the hazard pay money that CDCR staff can collect. I've a lot more to say but it really doesn't seem to matter.
