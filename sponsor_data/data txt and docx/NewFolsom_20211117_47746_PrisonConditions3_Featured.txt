This story was told by a person incarcerated at New Folsom.</br></br>

Caller: The other thing I wanted to point out that they can look at, they’ve got a new appeal process where we can no longer appeal issues at the institutional level. They call it a grievance. So, by calling - by not getting - by putting it as a grievance, it’s no longer binding to the institution as a legal term.</br></br> 

So now they’re holding the 602 grievances, which is supposed to be a 602 appeal, they hold it, they hold it past 60 days, and once they go past the 60 days, they say, "Oh well, this is the only response you get because we passed the 60 days, you don’t get a response," because they failed to respond within 60 days.</br></br>

And then, when you go to file it, the appeals office has been holding inmates' appeals over a year. I have about 10 of them that they have held over a year, and then they sent it back to me, and they say, "Well, we passed the 60-day time limit, so this is the only response, and there is no longer need for you to proceed with this appeal." So, they’re violating our due process with appeals, the pandemic, with the COVID-19, racism, and all this other kind of crazy stuff.</br></br>

But this is getting ready to shut off within 60 minutes - 60 seconds, they shut it off. I just wanted to give an update, and I will be writing and giving in more details of everything. Therefore, I just wanted to basically say because I got this letter, wanted to let you guys know that I will be writing again and giving more information.
