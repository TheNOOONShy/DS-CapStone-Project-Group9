This letter was written by a person incarcerated at New Folsom.</br></br>

I came to prison when I was 21 and being in prison didn't change much for me as far as my thinking and staying out of trouble. All this was or is, is a place with a bunch of other people just like me, same thinking, same goals, and none good.</br></br>

It took me picking up a new case in 2019 and sitting in the hole and missing my out date again. The third time to see how stupid I have been and realize I've wasted my life in here.</br></br>

The best years of my life gone, no life experiences, no memories, no girlfriend. OH ya, I forgot to mention I'm married but my ex left me as soon as I got arrested. So seven years now and I haven't heard from her.</br></br>

My mom use to come visit me even though its seven hours to here from where she lives. But I haven't seen her since January of 2020 because of the pandemic. And even now we have contact visits again but they are only one hour and you need to show a negative COVID test from within 72 hours of the visit. But you can't use a rapid test, it has to be a real test, which I've been told normally takes five days to get a response on.</br></br>

To be honest its a lot harder not having no one to talk to. Having no visits sucks and we were told we would get tablets so we could video chat with our people and email back and forth but that hasn't happened yet.</br></br>

I feel safe, there's no reason for me not to. And phone calls would make a huge difference too but we only get 15 minutes each day and you'll be lucky to get that 15 min. It seems like there's always something that gets in the way for us to get that call plus it depends on the C/O. Everyone runs program different some are ok and don't give you a hard time.</br></br>

The vaccines were offered to anyone that wanted it. I got the Pfizer two shots, two weeks apart. I felt fine.</br></br>

"How have you been coping with the crisis?" I wake up every day at 4:45am and by 5:30am I'm either drawing, working on my college courses or my self help classes. Since I started drawing I've felt the sense of achievement and that led to getting into college and other things.
