This story was told by a person incarcerated at Donovan.</br></br>


UCI: What have you been doing to cope?</br></br>


Caller: Me, myself, um, you know, I created some programs here on this yard. So I’ve been trying to stay [unintelligible], stay working out, and just stay tryna--you know, you stay busy.</br></br>


UCI: Oh, that’s good.</br></br>


Caller: So I been trying to do that, I took the shots and all. I still feel a little symptoms from when I had the COVID. ‘Cause you know, I have headaches sometimes, my breathing will go in and out sometimes.</br></br>


UCI: That’s not good.</br></br>


Caller: Yeah, so they--then they wrote a lot of us up because they said we refused to move, because they put a lot of money into the gym. A lot of guys didn’t want to move into the gym because it’s putting us more in harm’s way. I mean, you’re putting us with more infected people and all that, so they wrote us--they disciplined every--you know, they wrote us up.</br></br>


UCI: Oh, that’s--wow. Was there--</br></br>


Caller: It affects a lot of us. They wrote us to say we refused to move, when we was just trying to explain to them that we don’t wanna move into a situation where, you know, we was about to get off of it, ‘cause you already got us on quarantine already, but you trying to put us around people who are just starting out on COVID, and you know, you recatch it again. And which, they didn’t understand that.</br></br>


UCI: Was, like, were there a lot of people infected at your facility?</br></br>


Caller: No, just, it was like in my section. It started off with one person, and then my whole section winded up getting infected, so they had us isolate. Like, they shutted us in quarantine.</br></br>


UCI: Oh wow.</br></br>


Caller: And so, then they had us separated from everybody else. But then, you know, they got panicked ‘cause I guess they didn’t know what to do and all that, so they put money into the gym, and just tried to move us in the gym. But none of us was tryna do that, it’s like “is everybody prepared or not?” so let’s try to throw us somewhere with no safety or nothing.</br></br>


UCI: Yeah. Has the situation gotten any better recently or is it still not good?</br></br>


Caller: Well, after we wind up catching COVID and all that, then they start giving us real--start giving us masks, and now they wanna start giving us cleaning utensils and stuff like that. You know, now, it got a little better now: we can wipe stuff down, but we already been there, done that, with the COVID.</br></br>


UCI: Oh. Um--</br></br>


Caller: We’re waiting for the--we’re still waiting for our visits, we’re still waiting for, you know, for other programs and stuff to come back our way, I mean, we still--It’s like everything’s going slow.
