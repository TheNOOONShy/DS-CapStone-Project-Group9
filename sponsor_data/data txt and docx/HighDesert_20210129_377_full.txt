This letter was written by a person incarcerated at High Desert.</br></br>

My name is [redacted]. I was born and raised in California. I am the youngest of five children. We grew up in a humble loving home, raised by two hard-working loving parents, though we did have our rough times.</br></br>

I now find myself serving a sentence for a horrible mistake I committed, that I myself admitted doing when asked. I will never try to justify what I did. Though I know without a shadow of a doubt in my mind that I wouldn't of done it if I hadn't been under the influence of crystal meth and the horrible situation/relationship I was in. May God bless and comfort everyone that got hurt for what I did.</br></br>

Well now I've been in state prison for over a year. In that year alone, I've already been in three other prisons, and the one I'm currently in is the fourth one.</br></br>

Due to my kind of charge, I had trouble with cellmates that caused me to move from prison to prison. Which caused me to be very concerned for my safety.</br></br>

When I got to my current prison, I asked to be placed in single-cell status, due to the fact of what had happened in the previous prisons, not wanting to go through the hard situations I had gone through. But I got denied. I finally got blessed with a good cellmate and finally well off.</br></br>

Since I arrived at HDSP around late, I've signed up for school and rehabilitative programs. But was put on the waiting list, and was waiting for a while. I finally got into a rehabilitative achievement credit math class, that a fellow Christian brother helped me to get into. I attended about four classes, then it got shut down due to COVID-19 pandemic. That was back around 2020.</br></br>

Since then, I've been keeping busy and making efforts to better myself by doing in cell self-help packets that get offered here at HDSP. The packets focus on issues like anger management, addiction,  anxiety, and many more.</br></br> 

Since the lockdown, I've earned certificates competition chronos on, which teaches on how to re-think your story, change your life, cyclical pattern of behavior, and much more. Working on these packets have been a real help for me and have caused me to reflect on my mistake and bad choices that led up to it.</br></br>

I tested for COVID-19. I've been quarantined ever since. Due to that, what we get is a shower only once every three days. There's no recreational yard or day room.</br></br> 

What gets me the most is not being able to attend and continue in the rehabilitative achievement credit math class. Though I strongly believe that the in cell self-help packets do help my rehabilitation, they don't take time off as the RAC math class. They don't let us know if we ever gonna program again.</br></br>

I keep in contact with family through phone calls and letters. Though it's hard, I can't hug them or see them. But that's the consequence of sin. I'm truly grateful for all the love and support they've been showing me since day one of my calamity. </br></br>

As I look around in my cell, I can honestly say that I'm blessed by God through my family. I cope by just doing the best I can to better myself by reading the Bible and getting involved in the self-help packets. I keep some of their pictures up on the wall for motivation when I have difficult days. In all good conscience, I can't be lazy or complacent on my rehabilitative efforts when they have done nothing but show me their love and support.</br></br>

Well that's a real quick summary of what's going on with me. You're reaching out to me was a bit of a surprise. And I'm very grateful that there's people out there pushing for positive reform, especially during this pandemic. To know that there's people out there that still look at you as human being and don't define you by your mistakes. If I may ask, how did you guys or why? Why did you guys reach out specifically to me?</br></br>

Well may God bless you guys for what you're trying to do to help people like me in prison. I hope that the information I provided helps you as I tried my best to answer your questions the best I could. God bless you and be safe.
