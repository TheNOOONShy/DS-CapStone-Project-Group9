This story was told by a person incarcerated at Tulare South County Detention Center.</br></br>UCI: And how has the COVID situation been like there?</br></br>Caller: For the most part, they come in and test and all that, you know, I mean but as far as I'm concerned, the cleaning, keeping the Ñ you know what I mean? Because you got, because there is a lot of people come through, you know what I mean? So like, I think you should have a choice to have a bunkie that had a shot or don't have a shot. You know what I mean?</br></br>And they don't let you decide on that. So, you never know. I've had the shot. Then now I've been trying to get the booster shot, and they were trying to get my record on it and whatever, but I think the cleaning of the phones, and they should have a spray bottle all the time right here by the phones to clean the phones because you never know.</br></br>I mean, yeah. But, you know, I mean there's not a lot of us here. There's - I mean, just in this unit, there is 60. So, that is 60 people that are using these phones, and there's only two phones that, you know what I mean, they should have a spray to clean them, you know, to kill the bacteria or whatever, COVID. You know?</br></br>They make us wear face shields and a face mask all the time. You know? And then, you know, sometimes we need new ones because they get bent up, or they get dirty, or they get broke. And sometimes it's a pain in the butt to get one.</br></br>

But you know, then they give these masks to us that are rewashed. I mean, I don't know if they are supposed to rewash them. You know? If they do, then, you know, I mean Ñ some of them are stretched out.</br></br> 

You know, to me, they just don't put enough effort into making sure that we don't catch it in here. You know?</br></br>UCI: So you are saying they don't clean the phones at all? Like you've never seen them spray them down or like wipe them?</br></br>Caller: I mean, when I was in Hanford Jail, they would come in there immediately upon Ñ or would come in there and spray the phones down. And then the next people would use them.</br></br> 

They would spray them down between every individual. But here, they don't even have nothing to spray them down or, you know, to clean them with. You know?</br></br>As each person gets off, there should be something here to clean these phones. I mean, we could clean them ourselves, but we don't have no spray or anything to kill it with, you know? But, I mean, as far as I'm concerned, and then, you know, they sent [unintelligible] in like every other day to clean the showers.</br></br> 

And then we clean the unit, but that's every other day, you know? Sometimes we don't get to clean it every day, but sometimes we don't get Ñ it depends on what cops are working if we get to clean it at all.</br></br>You know? To me, it is about being Ñ you know what I mean? They want us to wear masks and all this even though we got vaccines and, you know, face shields. At least they get spray and some stuff to kill anything else that's lurking on the phones or the video visit things or the door handles, I mean, stuff like that. You know?</br></br>UCI: Yes. How does the lack of sanitation make you feel if you don't get new masks as often or because they don't clean as well as you want them to?</br></br>Caller: I think it's either people being lazy because really we don't have no way of getting access to anything to clean. We had to push it out to door or hand it out to the cops, and then they had to do it. And some, you know what I mean, and then you've got some of these Ñ most of these deputies, depending on who they are, are pretty more likely to do it for us.</br></br> 

But then you got this handful around here that don't want to do shit for us or won't do nothing for us you know? I think they have a job to do. You know what I mean? Do your fucking job. Excuse my language, but you know, just do your job.</br></br>UCI: Yes, no, I get that.</br></br>Caller: When I'm out there, you know what I mean, if they call me to come and do your roof, they expect me to do my job, and that's what I do. I do my job. So, it's just like everybody has their own job to do, you know? Like right now the deputies that are working, if we need something pertinent, we can ask them to go do it, and they'll get it for us.</br></br> 

Then there's this couple around here that are just straight inmate haters, you know? You don't like your job, go work somewhere else. Go work and do my job. I'll take your job right now.</br></br>But, I mean, and then the medical here, sometimes the medical is horrible here, I think. Sometimes, you know what I mean, I've been trying to get a couple things looked at like nodule on my neck. Still waiting a month later. My shoulder Ñ I don't know what I did to my shoulder, but I hurt my shoulder, and now it still hurts, and it is something deeper.</br></br>You know what I mean? I need them to do an X-ray. Tell me what is going on. It is like getting some things done here, and I think it's a lack of money for the state, or whatever it is, but still, they have a job to do. They need to do it.</br></br>UCI: Yeah, I understand that.</br></br>Caller: Yeah. Other than that, I pretty much don't have nothing else to, you know what I mean? I haven't ran across nobody with COVID yet or in here. I mean, there are some cases going on about it right now on the other jail, and they got us kind of on a lockdown, but you know, they still give us our care and stuff like that, but they are just not letting school go on on or programs go on because of it.</br></br>They are trying to be on top of it, but really there is, I mean, we watch the news all the time, and it is either it is getting worse some days, and then some days it is getting better, you know? I mean, they arrest all kinds of people, so I mean, you never know what comes in here. But they do 14 days quarantine, but you know, even if you get the shot, you still could get COVID. So there's my story. All right.</br></br>UCI: Yes, thank you.</br></br>Caller: All right. No problem. I know it is what it is. I've been in here for going on six months now.</br></br> 

I've got a couple months left, but now I have another guy that is interested in writing you guys or letting you guys know what's going on or giving his story, and he was just wanting to know what's the benefits for him contributing to the cause.</br></br>UCI: The benefits of writing in or just calling in and telling your story is that basically, this archive will remain online for the longest time, and it will serve as a resource for people to understand the unequal toll of the prison system in the U.S.</br></br> 

And it just serves as an information archive for people to educate themselves more on the subjects and to understand the inequality and just, you know, the unfairness that is going on. Yeah, so -  yeah, if he wants to write in, he is always welcome to.</br></br>Caller: Okay. All right. Well, I'm going to let him know because there is about four or five people in here got this letter. And so, but you know, some people are concerned about, you know, the cops getting ahold of it or it coming back on them.</br></br> 

We're not trying to get no retaliation on it, you know? Alright well, we have one minute, so I will relay this message to these guys in here about it, and we will see who calls in or who writes in. I wish you guys luck.</br></br>UCI: Wow, thank you so much. Have a good night.</br></br>Caller: Thank you. You too. Bye-bye.</br></br>UCI: Bye.
