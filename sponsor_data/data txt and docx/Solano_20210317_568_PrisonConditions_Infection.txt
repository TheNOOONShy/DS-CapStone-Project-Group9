This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Solano.</br></br>Remaining in this environment for another fourteen days with tests twice a week, then moved to our old areas once again. One Black inmate wrote a appeal on all of this, warden Matheson came to him directly to respond. His concerns were aforementioned to my own, she said, “six-feet distancing, CDCR does not abide by it for those inmates found to be positive because everyone in here is positive!”.</br></br>According to her separation now is fruitless! This is crazy, since a lot of us had been tested since August of 2020 and up until these moves, never were positive, nor had symptoms. Naturally, asymptomatic results vary but myself, I never received official documentation until I was scheduled to leave.</br></br>I’m a risk factor of 10, now and never have been given a first vaccination let alone the follow-up one. Everyone in this building has since today, been given two shots! We’re talking about younger inmates they need to work their PIA industry contracts as well Caltrans on the hill here!</br></br>The only support inmates are workers who also were energized much the aged. They are (CDCR) trying to fully open up by April 1st. Masks are exchanged once every two weeks and only just recently are KN95 masks.</br></br>Anyways, there is a possibility masks being monitored and thrown away unbeknown to us, believe it! It’s been investigated, found true before, and reported to California Inspection General in Sacramento. At least people have reported it happens.</br></br>I will call you collect one of these days but since you took a moment to write me, I feel the need to reply back to you. Thank you for believing in me too, feels good, especially I’ve nobody outside anymore to write. I’ve been locked up twenty-six years for a misdemeanor petty-theft.
