Dear PrisonPandemic,</br></br>

Thanks for your letter and concern.</br></br>

I’ll try to explain my experience, thoughts and realization. I am a 50 year old man serving 11 years. I am filled with mixed emotions when it comes down to this sickness. They promote social distancing but we’re crowded in a small area where it's completely ignored.</br></br>

I tested negative week after week and without a positive test I was moved to another dorm where inmates were positive or getting over it. If I did get it I didn’t feel it and it came and went. I am now in a dorm that’s supposed to be for 15 inmates but they have 30 inmates with no room. I wear my mask most of the time and I am clean and I wash my hands.</br></br>

I was given my first shot and I felt sick and my arm was sore for the day. I am waiting on my second shot. I am hoping for the best and relying on the Creator to help me get through the remaining six years I have to serve.</br></br>

I look at this place as a concentration camp where people come to die. My wishes is to remain where I am currently housed and do my schooling and drug classes. I’ve been moved three times and I only been here a year. Instead of containing the sickness they’re spreading it by moving everyone around so much.</br></br>

Well thanks for your time. If you have any more questions please write as you know this is a sad and lonely place. Make sound and good decisions.</br></br>

Best wishes.
