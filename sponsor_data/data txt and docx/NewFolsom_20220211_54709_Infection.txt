This story was told by a person incarcerated at New Folsom.</br></br>

Caller: Oh okay, yeah, one of the issues basically dealing with medically is seeing my specialist and stuff, and they canceled my rheumatologist and pulmonary appointment. That also at the same time today, they had another person go out to [redacted] hospital to go see his specialist. And then, a couple weeks before, another person went out to the hospital, and my last time I went out was December 2021.</br></br>

And then, before that, I hadn’t been out in almost a year. But other people been going out, and my thing is they're blocking me when all the COVID tests are coming back negative. So they test you before you go and when you come back. And then they do the temper stuff at the hospital before you go in.</br></br>

And at the time they're stopping the - they canceled my last appointments for whatever reason. It's really, I don't understand because the fact that they're trying to use the COVID situation to deny everything around here. And basically the quar- they're not following the quarantine protocols. So I didn't understand that.</br></br>

And so today just threw me for a loop when my partner went out, and he went out to the hospital, and then here it is, I can't go out for my serious underlying high-risk medical conditions. When all my COVID tests are negative, so, and that’s the main thing, I don't understand what they're blocking them for. So I’m just trying to find a way to get it. Get it out there, all the little nonsense that they're doing.
