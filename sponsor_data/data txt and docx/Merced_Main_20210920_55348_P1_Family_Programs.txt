This story was told by a person incarcerated at Merced County Jail.</br></br>

Caller: I just want to say that I believe, well, I've been here since - and I still haven't got a chance to see my family or anybody, for that matter. Because, you know, because of the coronavirus. And it's kind of - it's kind of hard.</br></br>

And also, with the mail, not only did it affect our visiting, but also our mail. Because they have to go through a process. Before we even get a letter, it's already been three weeks. And not only are they denying like, visits, but they're also, our mail.</br></br>

Like, 90 percent of my mail is getting sent back to my people because of - oh, cause they put a heart on the envelope or because of the fragrance, it smells like, with the perfume on there. Or just some, you know, dumb ass excuse, excuse my language. But you know like, it's just being, it's just, I feel like -</br></br>

And there's nothing we can do because their excuse is, "It's due to the pandemic. Due to the COVID," you know? And so, to me, it's - it's very stressful.</br></br>

I feel like, I mean, you know, based on I'm an inmate, I barely - I have no - I feel like I lost all my rights. And I feel like I'm just - pretty much, it's just - it's not right. That's how I feel.</br></br> 

And we're the only county, I believe, that don't even have, other counties have video calls. Like, video, just - they get to see their family through video calls and other stuff like that. And you know, they probably even have their visits back already, you know, from what I hear. Other counties already got their visits.</br></br>

CDC, you know, they have visits already, you know? And so, to me - yeah. So, I feel like that's not, that's not right.
