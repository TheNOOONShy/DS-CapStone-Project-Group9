This letter was written by a prisoner incarcerated at Tehachapi.</br></br>

I am the oldest brother of four sisters and five brothers. Our grandma is fighting cancer.</br></br> 

What will happen to them? Will I ever see them again? I thought stuff like this non-stop, sadly. With money in short supply, my family can hardly afford to pay for collect calls. So communication has become near impossible. So everyday is full of constant worry.</br></br>
 Then, one says a friend of mine put me in contact with the love of my life. His stepdaughter, a woman only 22 years older than myself. She has since acted on the middleman between me and my family. Letting me know how my family have been. A major relief.</br></br>
 So, to sum up this year. Other than not being able to get to school, yard, worship services, or anywhere else outside of my dorm for nearly a year. Life still sucks in here just way more than it ever did before. I only have a year and a half left until I can finally go home and see my family again.</br></br> 

COVID-19 makes time in here go on at a snailâ€™s pace. I cannot wait for the sweet taste of freedom. Mask or no mask.</br></br>
 To anyone who reads this, know that I may be a convict, but I do care. And I pray to the great earth mother that you find yourself in good health and high spirits during these troubling times. Me and my fellow druids the world over wish you peach, health, and safety.
