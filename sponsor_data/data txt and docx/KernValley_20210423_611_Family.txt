UCI: Is there anything else you want people to know about your experience?</br></br>


Caller: Well as far as my experience with COVID I mean it’s been horrible. At the beginning, I had a lot more negative things going on in my life other than COVID and then COVID came and it was just like an extra weight on my shoulders. I was in the hole for disciplinary reasons, then COVID came, then my father caught COVID, and he almost died from COVID. He’s damn near paralyzed now where he can’t even walk.</br></br>


I have a son I don’t know nothing about. I don’t know if his family got COVID. I don’t know what’s going on, i have family members in other states and countries. COVID has been horrible, it's been bad. I lost my wife because of COVID. It’s just been really bad and it’s still going on. Within myself it’s just not getting better so my experience with COVID has just been horrible. It’s something that I never want to experience ever again. I’ve lost a lot due to COVID.</br></br>


UCI: How do you think the COVID situation has affected your loved ones as well and just everything overall due to reduced visitation and everything?</br></br>


Caller: I know it’s affected my father a lot of great deals because he’s a business owner and because of COVID he wasn’t able to attend his business and emotionally the relationships between the people I love, as I repeat, I wasn’t able to see my wife because there’s no visits allowed and there’s no way to have that affection with one another. So emotionally it was too hard for her to deal with not being able to see me physically, not being able to come see me and the distance tore us apart. We ended up divorcing and now I had a wife, someone who I really loved and cherished, someone who I changed a lot of negative thinking and negative ways in prison because of her and I wanted to show her that men here can rehabilitate and change and be different. Because of COVID and the distance that it caused, it broke us apart.</br></br>


The communication that I had with my mother and father was low. When I come from a good family, I guess you can say I’m a stereotyped Latino family. It’s broken us apart. It’s been rough, we’re not able to talk as much as we want. Even now, just to get on this phone I had to start getting out of my door to get the phone call. It’s like the cops here are doing nothing, just sleeping. It’s like I have to start yelling out of my door like I’m crazy just to get this phone call.</br></br>
