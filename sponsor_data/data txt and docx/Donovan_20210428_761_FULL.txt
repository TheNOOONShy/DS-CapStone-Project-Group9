Hi PrisonPandemic,</br></br>

Nice to have received this message from you! I’m doing well, and yes in good health.</br></br>

First of all, please allow me to introduce myself. My name is [redacted]. My family and friends call me [redacted]. If you wish to you can also refer to me as [redacted].</br></br> 

More about myself, I was born in a hospital in Montgomery Park, California. I was raised in North-East Los Angeles. I’m 46 years of age. First generation Mexican American. My height is important, because it's not always you encounter a 6’ (foot) 3’ (inch) tall Mexican.</br></br> 

I’ve been incarcerated for the past 24 years. I’m doing a life term for a crime I did not commit. My parole hearing is next month.</br></br>

I must admit, it was odd to see an unknown name/address on the return address. Since I’m going to my initial parole board hearing on May 2021. I thought I was getting some kind of ad for a service?</br></br>

I felt a little anxiety as I started to open the letter. As I read along I felt at ease but also a little excitement to realize what this letter was really about.</br></br>

It was meant to be to have received this letter from you. Because I was about to write someone to thank them for writing a support letter to the (BPH) Board of Parole Hearing. So, why not try it out, and answer your letter?!</br></br>

I took it upon myself to go above and beyond the call of duty to assist you with this project. I hope my contribution is adequate enough!?</br></br>

When I first heard the news, I was uncertain on how COVID was going to affect us in prison!? Since we’re in a bubble and like with the common cold/flu. Once someone gets sick, everyone starts showing the symptoms. The fact that most prisoners practice good hygiene helped lessen the worry of spread.</br></br>

Unlike the rest of this prison, we are fortunate there has been no positive cases of COVID-19 to the inmate population on our yard. All the reports on the news concerning the number of infections and deaths all over the world worries me, for my family. As the time passes and we got well informed on what was going on with COVID-19. We were restricted on movement (lock-down).</br></br> 

There was still no vaccine at the time. So, there was some uncertainty to how the pandemic was going to end?</br></br>

Now, after getting vaccinated (second shot February 22, 2021). We’re waiting for things to get back to normal. I haven’t played (group sports) basketball in a very long time. It's my favorite sport.</br></br> 

My safety was never a big concern. Like I said we live in a bubble, so once people in here realized the seriousness of this pandemic no one had a problem with following guidelines, and wearing masks.</br></br>

Visitations are an important factor to keep ties with family close. So reduced visitation had been hard on most. It's helped we're able to keep contact with our families over the phone.</br></br>

As for the vaccinations, they were being administered according to the phase/tier system. Inmates had their choice to whether to receive the shot or not. I received mine on January 12, 2021 too (first shot), and the second shot was on 2/22/21. I actually got lucky to receive my shot ahead of the rest of the population because there were left over vaccines, after the 75 year and older bracket received their shot.</br></br>

To answer your question on, “how have you been coping with this crisis?” For me personally, it has not been any different from the past 24 years I’ve been incarcerated. The main thing was not to worry, keep informed, and wear a mask.</br></br>

This pandemic has been surreal. If it wasn’t for all the reporting of deaths all over the world, I would have never believed that this whole pandemic actually occurred. It's also kinda odd to see everyone around you, on the TV, always wearing a mask. I feel sorry for all those people out there who’s worried about paying bills, losing their jobs, or if they’ll be able to put food on the table.</br></br> 

A lot of things are out of control out there. Crime rate is up, job loss, pollution.</br></br>

It's kind of sad to say but it seems like the lockdowns and isolation on people out there has had a negative effect on people. In the very beginning I told my family now you have an idea how it feels to be in prison. It was only weeks into the pandemic and people were feeling the trauma and stress caused by being on lockdown. I think this pandemic brought out the good and bad from people.</br></br>

I just hope things get back to normal for everyone out there; as much as it possibly can?!</br></br>

If there's anything you need clarifying or further substance on a subject, please feel free to inquire.</br></br>

I respect your effort to help others at a time like this, and what you’re doing as a college student. I’m glad to have shared my story with you. Of course this is my perspective of how I’ve dealt with this crisis. I’m sure others in the prison system have not fared so well. And I just want to take this opportunity to express my concern for those people, and wish them well.</br></br>

Well, it was nice writing you. Hope all is well with you. On my part it’s okay if you write me back. I wouldn’t mind to meet someone new, and learn more about your world. Hope to hear from you soon. Take care. Be safe. God Bless.</br></br>

Sincerely,</br></br>

PS. Give my regards to your professor.
