This story was told by a person incarcerated at High Desert.</br></br>

Caller: So basically what the issue was, what it is right here is that this was one of the last prisons that was still programming while others had stronger restrictions in place.</br></br> 

UCI: Mhmm.</br></br> 

Caller: And by around the end of October 2020 it is when it began shutting down. A lot of us were lucky at the time to go to commissary but after that everything started shutting down and we were just subject to a lot of cruel and unusual punishment. And even our food portions, they started cutting down on that so what this pandemic did was it just made it worse for all prisoners basically. </br></br>

It's- we’re restricted to a lot of things, and the problem is the way they try to deal with it, it was too, they didn’t prepare for it. So by the time it reached this institution they started doing a lot of changes, trying to figure out what was the best solution.</br></br> 

So what they did started doing was within the past two months they started doing the nasal swab and that was going alright. But the problem with that was when people started getting sick or testing as positive they ended up taking both the inmate and the cellmate. And then after a while what they started doing is, they kept- they stopped taking the cellmate and they kept- they just took the other individual who was taken to another block and it was considered a quarantine block.</br></br> 

The problem with that was those individuals came back and then some of them tested asymptomatic. Now the thing with that is that if these individuals end up getting sick again or 'cause a lot of them didn’t feel symptoms, then they could easily spread it that includes through the ventilation system. So as far as controlling it, it’s gotten out of hand.</br></br>

I’m not sure if it’s costing them a lot of money as far as to test us, but they stopped doing the nasal swabs for a while. And they were just doing the temperature checks and I guess check our temperatures with some device that they use to put closer near our head and another that clips onto our fingers. And then in some occasions, they wouldn’t wipe them.</br></br> 

So a lot of the inmates were touching the same thing. And the thing was that even people who were quarantined now they’re no longer taking- they're permitted, they have the option to stay in the block. So those individuals when they get sick they start getting everyone else sick and from the way I see it, and the way a lot of us see it, is that they’re deliberately trying to get us sick. And we know that this institution, these institutions get a lot of money off of that so we’re thinking they’re trying to milk it.</br></br>

Because by them in doing that they allow us- they have the upper hand on us and we’re not able to program. So right now we’re like on a modified program which just indicates that we’re only permitted to move around within each- our section or which is called a dayroom and we only get phone calls, shower, and use the kiosk. But aside from that, everything’s in cell so we’re not given strong disinfectants and that’s another issue right there.</br></br> 

So we do have masks, we do have gloves, but it’s not stopping the spread of the virus. So as far as the way they’re managing it, it’s done very very poorly.</br></br>

UCI: I’m really sorry to hear that. If possible could you give me a breakdown of how the outbreak has affected your facility in terms of month by month? Is stuff being handled differently from the beginning or has it always just been the same?</br></br>

Caller: Well, it was, I mean the way we were running, 'cause like I said it was October by the time we ended up catching it up here and the thing was the way- it’s way different now. But the way we ended up getting it was off those individuals that caught it from Chino I guess is spread to San Quentin. And instead of keeping those individuals at San Quentin, they decided to transfer those individuals to the level three that’s across the street from here which is Susanville.</br></br>

So 250 people caught it within a week and they sent some people over here and then we all started catching it and that’s how they went about that. And by then it was already too late. So now we're- it’s just a lot of- what it is is that everybody is getting frustrated because one of the main problems [unintelligible] shopping in commissary, so we’re going four months and no shops for some inmates but not all inmates.</br></br> 

So they already know that that creates a lot of tension cause they’re favoring other people over others so that’s one of the big concerns right there too. As far as medical goes, the medical is very bad in here. It’s not the best. If you have an issue, they’ll tell you that there’s nothing wrong with you.</br></br>

So I’ll make an example, last week, I’ve been having heart problems for a while already and I believe that it’s from ricochets, that I probably ricocheted more people to my heart. But they had done an x-ray on me about two weeks ago and they found a white spot on my heart and they said that that wasn’t normal. But when I went to the doctor who was I supposed to see for a follow up,[unintelligible] so what he ended up saying was “oh there’s nothing wrong with you”.</br></br> 

And they just shut it down as that. So that's one of the main concerns is that we’re not receiving top quality medical care and that’s what is affecting a lot of people.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, I’m really sorry to hear that. Have you yourself been infected with the COVID-19 virus?</br></br>

Caller: No, no, but there’s a few people that are down- are all around me that are infected. And- </br></br>

UCI: Okay, well I -</br></br>

Caller: I was- yes continue.</br></br>

UCI: I was just gonna say well that I hope you are able to stay safe and those around you get better soon, but please finish sorry.</br></br>

Caller: What I was gonna say was while we’re given options to take a shot, the majority of people did take a shot. I refused to take a shot, because to be quite honest, the way they do things around here, it’s not that I’m paranoid, but it’s also the fact that it’s not something that’s guaranteed.</br></br> 

And I don’t really know what they’re giving us. They play a lot of games so I’m kinda suspicious of it so eventually I will take it but a lot of people like cellmate, he did end up taking it.</br></br>

UCI: What could your facility do to make the situation better in your opinion?</br></br>

Caller: Well I mean the thing is, they need to train the staff better because one of the main things is that a lot of staff believe that corona is nothing and come here with no masks or touching stuff. They’ll hand us trays, touching our food trays, and they’ll say “corona isn’t shit, corona isn’t there” right so that’s one of the things is the way people perceive it, they see it as a joke.</br></br> 

And if they were to see it more as a serious issue then that would be one ways- one of the forms in which they could correct their actions and be able to manage this better.</br></br>

UCI: I’m really sorry to hear that, I don’t think that that’s fair. And how has the COVID-19 situation at your facility affected your loved ones?</br></br>

Caller: Well I mean it’s stressful right, but not to the- but like I’ve been incarcerated 21 years already and the thing is that it’s just not being able to go to the law library. Like new laws passed and which I’m affected by and I was 15 years old when I was- when I got locked up, so people who are my age are permitted to now go home, right? But we’re not permitted to a lot of liberties so I can’t do a lot of things, I just stick to myself.</br></br> 

And that’s one of the main concerns is that they shut everything down from programs to jobs and everything.</br></br>

UCI: I’m sorry to hear that. How have you been coping with the crisis with you know, reduced programming like you’ve talked about?</br></br>

Caller: Well I mean, I study in the cell a lot. I mean, I do everything in my power, so like OK I’m gonna make an example. So they had these programs to become a paralegal and they cost about like- over $800 so I used my stimulus check to get that. Now what the institution did was, they held my- they've been holding onto my money for three months.</br></br> 

Which is all my books so I can’t utilize that money, they already approved me to send the money out, but for some reason, they’re saying they’re short on staff so they can’t process it. So, it’s things like that that really upset me because I needed some of that to get out and start doing good for myself and my family. And stuff like that is what tends bothers me, but aside from that I just remain studying, keeping myself occupied.</br></br>

UCI: Well I think that that’s a great thing that you’re studying and you know you should really be proud of yourself for that, but I am sorry to hear that, this has affected you in that way. What else would you like people that are listening to this in the future, what would you like them to know about your experience?</br></br>

Caller: I mean if they were to do audits, actual audits where they speak to inmates not speaking to the staff because anytime they speak to the staff, especially medical staff, they’re going to lie to them and they’re gonna tell them, “oh we’re managing it properly” and the thing is that’s not true.</br></br>

If you were to speak to groups of inmates and in different parts and institutions you’ll actually get more or less an idea of how this crisis is affecting people. And how to better utilize money instead of just handing it over to them and having them probably not spend it accordingly or pocketing some of that money. So I think that they should do more audits in institutions in order to fix that problem.</br></br>

UCI: Do you feel protected at your facility?</br></br>

Caller: Well I mean like in what sense?</br></br>

UCI: From COVID, do you feel like they’ve done an adequate job at protecting you?</br></br>

Caller: No, not even close no, not even close. Let me see, somebody, probably like five cells down from me there’s people that have COVID, there’s somebody downstairs, right in front of me, about 10 yards away from me that got COVID. So, and there’s nothing that separates them from me, so I don’t see how anyone could feel protected in that sense. And we all have the same ventilation system.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah I’m really sorry to hear that, if you could, could you talk a little bit more about the distrust that you have? I know that you talked about- I know they- sorry continue,</br></br>

Caller: Sorry could you repeat that again, please?</br></br>

UCI: I was just saying you talked a little bit about not trusting the staff especially when it comes to the COVID vaccine. Could you talk a little bit more about where that distrust comes from and in your experience why you feel that way?</br></br>

Caller: Because they send us these bulletins that they explain what this, it's Moderna, the one they’re utilizing and then we see in the news where it’s said that one of the Moderna’s caused a lot of reactions in people. And then they cancel one now but they permitted to use another form of Moderna and now this in this institution they’re trying the Moderna but they’re not really doing a lot out there.</br></br>

What they do tell us is that we likely won’t catch COVID off of it. However, it’s still a possibility because these are new drugs that they haven’t even really experimented on a lot of people yet. So that’s one of my main concerns is that they haven’t really perfected it, that drug of choice so I’d rather just wait a little bit and then go from there.</br></br>

UCI: Is there anything that I haven’t asked you yet that you would like to share with me or?</br></br>

Caller: I mean, well I don’t really know what else as far as COVID goes. I just hope that it does get managed better and a lot more individuals get involved in this. Not only prison staff and medical staff, that it’s more people from the outside that come to the institutions.</br></br>
