This story was told by a person incarcerated at Elmwood Correctional Facility.</br></br>

UCI: Awesome. Okay so go ahead and tell me about your experience.</br></br>

Caller: Well the experience is kind of, you know, I never experienced anything like this. 'Cause, you know, they have everybody in certain and then - what you call it, they go into some quarantine and they quarantine for like two to three weeks, and then they move you from one facility to another. They keep on, you know, checking up on you and running tests to see if you got COVID.</br></br>

If not then they move you on up to different facilities within the place here. And you know, they just do random checks on you to see if, you know, you are not contagious with the - with the COVID you know, and then they give your shots.</br></br> 

Yeah, it's just an experience that I never had here. I've been here before, it's just - it's kind of a hard time to go through in here.</br></br>

UCI: And what happens to someone if they test positive?</br></br>

Caller: They move them all to a lockdown facility where they're quarantined again until they are not positive again, and then they close the whole facility where that person went positive on avenue. They close down the whole facility, and take everybody up and send them all down to lockdown.</br></br>

UCI: And what's the lockdown facility like?</br></br>

Caller: Well, it’s just - it's just like a two-man cell you know, and basically you don’t come out. You don’t come out, you come out only when like 20 to 30 minutes and that’s it. You take a shower and after you pass all [unintelligible] that, I guess you pass the quarantine and then you come out back to - to the other facility, and they constantly just call you up just to give you a following up to see if you are feeling good, you know?
