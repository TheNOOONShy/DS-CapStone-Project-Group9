Galatians 5:13</br></br>
God give me 24 hours a day. I give God one hour a day by reading my our daily bread and my bible letters in red.</br></br>Dear students,</br></br>
Grace, peace, good health, and love be with all of you.</br></br> 

First of all, I am not a very good speaker with words. I too was a student at one time, Anaheim High Class of '71. Now I am doing 50 years to life. I have been down 19 years on July 2, 2021.</br></br> 

I am a very lucky man. I have people who love me, but there are men and women and kids who have no one to help them with food, letters, visits, cards but most of all love. People need love and loved ones.</br></br>
 I have four brothers, three sisters, 12 grandkids I cannot see because of COVID-19 pandemic and a 92-year-young mother that has been there for me since day one.</br></br>
I have a great job on the yard, I get out of my cell for 7 til 3:30 p.m. But now one man was sick, now we are all lockdown. I went from eight hours to zero hours a day. I love to play handball but as of December 7, no more sports on the yards. I got COVID-19 in May. Now I lost my cellie on October 2. He got it. It's not safe here. It's not safe out there. We just have to pray for God to help us all. It is difficult but life is difficult.</br></br>
Just love one another, and tell your family everyday I love you so much. God bless you all. Stay positive test - your brother in Christ.
