This story was told by a person incarcerated at Los Angeles County Men’s Central Jail.</br></br>

Caller: Like since, like since the COVID started, like I'm in high power. So they don't give us like masks. They only gave us those like once every two months, I think, in the beginning.</br></br> 

They didn't give us a mask until like three months after the COVID situation started. They didn't give us no cleaning material. They don't clean the housing unit we're in.</br></br>

Like they didn't come with the vaccine until like a week ago. And – what else – stuff like that. They don't let us – they don't let our family – well, they don't let me – my family – bring me masks because of my situation and my status in the county.</br></br>

UCI: Okay. And you said that you aren't able to get masks from your family members and they aren't providing them to you?</br></br>

Caller: No. Well, they do provide them sometimes. But, sometimes, they don't let us get em. Just because I got a different status in the county jail – just because I'm high power.</br></br>

UCI: Okay. And-</br></br>

Caller: So it depends on like – it depends on like, I guess – I mean I think because they discriminate us a lot. Because we're in high power, they really don't let – like your family could bring you masks. But, if they don't like you, then, you just can't get a mask in here.</br></br> 

And it's kind of hard. Because, if we get sick in here – and we're like in a - in a big pod – and people have got sick in here. And they really don't do nothing about it. And they just don't give us masks until we really ask them, but.</br></br>

UCI: And how has the COVID situation at your facility affected your loved ones?</br></br>

Caller: Oh, well, we can't get visits. We haven't got visits in over – going on like six – six – three months – going on six, three months. We don't get visits from our families.</br></br>

And, if they do, they got to get a vaccine to come first. But, even then, they don't - they don't allow our families to come in because of the COVID sometimes. So it kind of affects us pretty bad.
