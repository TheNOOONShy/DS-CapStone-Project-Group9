This story was told by a person incarcerated at Toad Road Jail.</br></br>Caller: My concern is that we will quarantine or detach, almost, we're going to be almost a month on quarantine. And we only get 15 minutes a day of a shower. And we all get the negative. And they put some people that take the positive and put them on pills. And then they got him out of here and they already working. But now that they have a job and having quarantine we can't do anything we only can get, like I said get 15 minutes a day for the shower.</br></br>In accordance with the law, we're supposed to get an hour every day of at least, stretch your legs, we're in the cell 24/7. And in the cell, we've got to pick up our food and come back to the cell. And we don't have actually well no visit. We only have video visit when whenever you know people can do them. Now, another thing is that my question is to you guys understanding I don't know what the purpose is you guys thing is of act to share? Or to let you guys know what's going on? I think it's not very, that you're listening to me?</br></br>UCI: Yeah, I'm listening to you.</br></br>Caller: Yeah, okay. So, my understanding is, is this is not according to law, because even though we're not positive. We're not being treated by any kind of bacteria, because we already tested like I said, with just a [intelligible] , me and my cellmate, we tested positive twice, but we're still on lockdown to the patch, almost, we're going to be in a month already in this kind of crap, which I think is not fair.</br></br>And, and you know what I mean? And then we can't talk to anybody, anytime we ask any question they tell us, well, you know, that's the big boss who knows what the big boss says, and we're gonna go call him to see what they say. But I know my understanding, we should get at least an hour a day, with recreation or you know, besides talking to the walls, you know, is psychologically is affecting it. Even though we're inmates we committed a crime, which is like, whatever, you know, we got to do what we got to do, but the same time, we cannot be treated like animals, you know what I mean?</br></br> Well, like I can say we're like criminals without papers, you know what I mean?  Besides other people that commit crimes, and they have a permit to do it. Which, you know, my understanding is we should get at least an hour a day, but it remains or you know, in a way we just we'll get our inmate rights violated by you know, just not giving us at least what we're supposed to get. Now, whether you guys can do anything about it, I don't know.
