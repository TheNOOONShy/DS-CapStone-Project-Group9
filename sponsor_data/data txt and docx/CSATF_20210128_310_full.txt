This letter was written by a person incarcerated at SATF (California Substance Abuse Treatment and State Prison).</br></br>

I am currently housed at SATF-SP at Corcoran. During my 16 years of incarceration, I have seen massive movement of inmates two times. The first time was in 2008 when because of overcrowding we were shipped to Mississippi to an out-state private prison where our safety was put at great risk.</br></br>

Many inmates lost their lives. Others were badly injured after so many riots and other picked up unnecessary felony charges. My second experience was in the COVID-19 pandemic during the months of November and December of 2020. I never thought this virus was going to come near me or my fellow friends or inmates, but it did.</br></br>

My fear became reality that in spite of mask wearing, many inmates became illed by this deadly virus. As testing became available for us, so did the amount of inmates who were testing positive for COVID-19. From this prison yard, I could see the level two yard inmates being escorted out their pods to be quarantined, week after week.</br></br> 

I was growing concerned just to think how terrifying it was to die of breathing problems, living in eight-men pods and spreading the virus from inmate to inmate. I am in a two-men cell and I thought I was safer than those in eight-men pods.</br></br> 

One morning, as I watched the news, they talked about 667 inmates being infected with COVID. Then two weeks later another 770-something inmates and staff were infected with COVID. D yard level four inmates went on a lockdown because 300 inmates came out positive in the very few weeks when testing had just begun.</br></br>

Inmates from my yard, level three, had to go to the central kitchen and take their assigned job and cook for all the yard at this facility. My cellmate was one of these people going over to a level four yard and do the work.</br></br>

He was so afraid of catching the virus where many inmates from that yard had just come out positive a few weeks before. Little by little, inmates from my level three yard started to give positive COVID tests.</br></br> 

Testing began here every Friday and then twice a week. One morning after seeing many inmates testing positive ,the building I was in was going to be used as a quarantine block. And then the movement began. Groups as many as 10 inmates were being moved to other buildings from shift in and shift out.</br></br> 

My group was the last one to leave building one around a time we went to building three where as weeks went by the testing and the COVID positives kept coming up. Two weeks later, my celly came out positive. He had many symptoms from fever to fatigue to weakness. He told me he had never felt like that before. I gave him some Tylenol and two days later he felt better.</br></br> 

The day they told him he was positive I was concerned with my health due to the fact that two years ago I caught valley fever, another respiratory disease which almost killed me. Having the valley fever still in my system and dealing with COVID, I thought it was going to be tough for me.</br></br> 

I was told I had to move to two building because I had been exposed to COVID. They ended up turning three building into quarantine block when hundreds of inmates tested positive. I was moved by myself to two block that same night. The cop told me he was going to put another inmate in there with me.</br></br>

This inmate went in to live in another cell with someone else but the next morning he was told he came out positive and was moved to one of the quarantine blocks. Two days after being in two block I went to test. This time I came out positive.</br></br> 

That same day many other who also came out positive were told we are going to be quarantined. All two quarantine blocks were filled with COVID positive so we were moved to A yard level two gym. We were close to 50 inmates inside a gym, some with mild symptoms, some with very bad symptoms.</br></br> 

Many would share their stories of how they got it and how their smell and taste was lost for many weeks. My symptoms were very mild. I only experienced sore throat, headache, and runny nose and some flem. We spent from 14 to 20 days cooped up in a gym where some nurses use to come to check our vitals twice a day.</br></br> 

After 20 days in the gym, the rumor was that CDC didn’t want to pay correction officers for their overtime at the gym, so they moved us to C yard active level four. We spent two weeks in a two-men cell at a high custody level four where we didn’t get no program, only a shower twice a week.</br></br> 

After one whole month bouncing from yard to yard of all different custody levels, we finally came back to E yard. The news was that every one on this yard had already caught COVID so the testing had diminished.</br></br> 

One years had passed without seeing my family. My sisters wish they could see me and my mother is always mad at me. I spoke with her but my incarceration has separated us physically and emotionally growing hard. She’s in our hearts.</br></br>

I only hope this pandemic doesn't affect my family. I have noticed my son stopped texting. So did my sisters. My mom don’t talk with me. Visitation here at this prison are virtual. I don’t feel comfortable even asking my people to schedule one for 30 minutes and listen to them through earbuds.</br></br> 

When things have been rocky in my family, this pandemic has made it rockier even more. The only way to cope with this is by asking God to help me even when I am wrong. Things here in prison haven’t been easy. Our program has been cut down to a five percent.</br></br> 

We only get one hour or recreation time in the yard, out of 24 hours of each day. We have no movement to any vocational or educational program. Some buildings get only one hour of dayroom. Healthcare are only responding to the COVID crisis unless it is an emergency, then medical staff will see us. Complaints of 602 or medical 602 are taking it from three to six months to be evaluated. Medical necessities are being delayed, cancelled, or postponed due to the COVID crisis.</br></br> 

Like I said my only way to cope has been with prayer to God, exercising to release stress, and drawing, reading, and writing to spend time productively. To deal with this confinement, I also have been watching a lot of TV and playing video games in my table.</br></br> 

I have run out of food so sometimes I go hungry. My only way of making some money was by selling cards and my artworks or portraits. Now I cannot expose it in the dayroom because we either don’t have any dayroom or we are only there for one hour.</br></br> 

These times are tough being in a little cell for 23 to 24 hours with another man who, for the most part, likes to argue and fight with other men. I have to find many ways to protect myself and even battle with my own self because any smell, sound, look, or even taste can trigger bad emotions or thoughts, which may lead to violence. So I have to be very humble and educate myself in order for me to not fall victim of others or myself.</br></br>

This COVID pandemic, combined with my incarceration, have been the toughest months in my prison term. Everyone here complains and talk to one another but there is no one who listens to us. We only have to become strong and patient until the day we go home.</br></br> 

I feel sorry for those who I knew and fell victims of this deadly virus. I am lucky enough to still be alive. Only still growing concern with the new strains of this virus which, slowly but surely, are creeping up into our counties and very soon will be in our prisons to make matters worse.</br></br>

My only hope strength and prayer is to God. His is my fate and future while I am still alive.
