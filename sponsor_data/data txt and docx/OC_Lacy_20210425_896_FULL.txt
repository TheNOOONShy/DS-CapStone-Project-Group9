Dear: PrisonPandemic</br></br>

Greetings!</br></br>

Currently housed at the Theo Lacy Facility. I got a letter from one of your students whom signed only as C. The purpose of this letter is not county COVID-19 stories, although at the end I will share some county highlights. The spirit of this letter is heart and your spirit as a professor in this three billion dollar industry called: ICE.</br></br>

Check this out:</br></br>

According to the post, immigration and custom enforcement maintains 15 detention centers around the country and on any given day there are 35,000 people in custody! Last year ICE detained over 400,000 undocumented workers and deported about (if not more) the same number at a cost of $20,000 per deportee.</br></br>

The entire (worthless) ICE system eats about (as of 2018) two billion dollars federal tax payers money. The largest immigration. Ones that could or should complain do not speak english enough to know they have rights!</br></br>

God, is love, if I have love, I have god. But allow me to keep this neutral.</br></br>

PrisonPandemic, you and your students have no idea how much power you have with pen and paper, and you have laptops!</br></br>

Evil, corruption, and/or hate that is let be it hurt us all! Don’t believe me? Check this out!</br></br>

Somewhere in the middle east hate, power, money got together and corruption was born isis! They decided to carry that hate towards USA reasons? Who knows and who cares, their hate costed USA over 11,000 dead people, plus multimillion dollar loss in damages without mentioning, terror, pure terror right here at home! Do you remember that day? What were you doing? Did you get scared?</br></br>

Well, I could go on and on, but I don’t have paper or envelopes enough, so without preamble, ICE is born! A federal entity. Immigration and customs enforcement, one would think, “well that’s good,” but once again, check this out.</br></br>

In addition to the 15 ICE facilities, the fed’s contract with hundreds of county jails, prisons, juvenile detentions (hello Santa Ana city jail and Adelanto) to house their detainees at a cost of about $250 a person. Two thirds of this facility are privately owned.</br></br>

Homeland security, which ICE answers to, has a quota mandated by congress. No other law enforcement agency operates on a quota system! On paper, and you know better than anyone that ‘on paper and actual’ are not the same, ICE has protocols and standards. But not legally enforceable such as “keeping families together”.</br></br>

And since there is no independent oversight, the detainees are often exposed to abuse, long-term solitary confinement (hello! Yours truly four months in 2014), terrible medical and mental health care, and even worse food.</br></br>

Often at risk (since housed with criminals) of assault, even rape! Last year 150 people (including minors) died under ICE custody! And this the reason of this letter! The many kids, without mom or dad, housed in Long Beach. While watching the news, I saw their little brown faces. I closed my eyes and I thought about their homes, and I saw PrisonPandemic project, therefore this letter.</br></br>

Funny how things work huh?</br></br>

I personally have been in ICE custody twice. I was put in solitary confinement for four months only because the guards didn’t “like me”. This is the truth so help me god.</br></br>

ICE was born after terrorist attacks of 9/11, Al Qaeda has been defeated but their terror is still at home current an enforced by ICE. Evil, corruption, and/or hate that is let be it hurts us all. ICE must be abolished. ICE is a waste of money (yeah, your money, your student’s money, tax money, fed loans hello).</br></br>

ICE is so inadequate, that it is known to have deported american citizens! ICE, the terror here at home, why? Let’s flip the coin, do you have any idea how it is to live here as a kid, american citizen with undocumented mom and dad? Their fear?? The terror that mom and dad are going to work but may or may not come back?</br></br>

Those kids born here, american citizens, living in terror under the stars and stripes! No kid should go to bed scared under their own roof, especially in america. And nobody knows these facts, nobody asks. There’s no accountability on how that federal money is spent, nobody tells, no one cares. Is like forgotten people.</br></br>

DHS, DRD, ICE policy of “not separating families” is not honored. I read an article in the NY Times a while ago that said something like this:</br></br>

A family from Cameroon, mom, dad, five kids all living in a small apt In the Bronx. ICE kicked their door one night (of course, like vermin, hiding with the shadows) and grabbed the father and shipped him back to Africa. The mother is undocumented, too, she and the kids living in fear she’ll be deported too. The kids are american citizens!</br></br>

When ICE was asked about this case, some officer said something like, “The state of New York has an excellent foster care system.” Can you believe that??</br></br>

The god almighty all loving I worship decided to make California a sanctuary state. But there’s so much injustice that ICE brings. I also fear those kids, left mom, dad, their homes somehow made it to the USA border, in risk of lost, kidnap even rape; somehow made it here only to get raped here!</br></br>

PrisonPandemic, I don’t know you nor I know your politicals, and spiritual beliefs so I’ll be neutral: Love.</br></br>

Somehow you and your students were given the means and opportunities, someone like me did not. Schooling at a higher level. Your heart, soul is to give a voice to people like me or those kids. Do not be afraid, pursue that objective, your inner fire.</br></br>

If done from the heart HE (god) will do the work, but he and we need you. God shows his love through others, but he put you here for that reason. Now out of love, I’m asking you to do a project, or something, about abolishing ICE. And for those little kids in Long Beach that do not know you, but do need you.</br></br>

You and your class are a beacon of light, for a better tomorrow, for the ones who follow. If not you then who? If not now then when?</br></br>

Evil that is let be it hurts us all, I am not a university student, heck I did not even get to go to high school but, with this letter I did my part. I also wrote to ACLU.</br></br>

It would be astonishing if those kids in Long Beach were given the chance of school!! Knowledge is a gift no one can take away from you. Unlike freedom. Who knows how long they’re gonna be in ICE custody, maybe some ESL, then regular school.</br></br>

In USA if a kid does not go to school, that’s illegal. Kids are sponges for knowledge. It would be great if these kids had the opportunity of that gift. That way, whatever they go next at least they have english.</br></br>

I’m just throwing it out there. May god bless you all in many ways!</br></br>

Yours truly.</br></br>

Side Note:</br></br>

Orange County jails are “stuck” although the COVID-19 vaccine has been offered to all inmates and for the most part, the pandemic is under control; the OC jails’ kitchens are still closed! We get two baloney sandwich, one orange, one milk, one pack of mini cookies, served at 35 degrees to 40 degrees cold for breakfast, lunch, and dinners!</br></br>

Inhumane, unjust, cruel, and sad. I’ve been here since Feb., this has been going on for over one year!</br></br>

Because of ACLU, Judge Wilson, demanded jails population to be cut to 50%. I’m not sure if this is still being honored or not. But it seems that cruel food should be grounds enough for an “early kick” or early release.</br></br>

PPP or PrisonPandemic project, have not even scratch the surface of incarceration during the pandemic. I am (because LGBT, I’m gay) housed on a mod. But barracks and dorms were really affected. I’ve heard of inmates, at the beginning of the pandemic, being neglected because COVID-19 was often confused with the flu.</br></br>

Inmates who complained about their lungs and jail deputies neglected. Jails in Orange County are known for the cruelty from deputies. Also, OC jails’ time calculation is at 50%. You have to do six month out of 12 months. San Diego, San Bernardino counties do 30%, LA does 10%!</br></br>

But the food pre-during-post COVID-19 is cruelty, inhumane, unjust and nobody cares about inmates’ lives.
