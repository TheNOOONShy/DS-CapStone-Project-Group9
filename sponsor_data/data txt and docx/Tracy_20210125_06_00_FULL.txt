This story was told by a person incarcerated at Tracy.</br></br>
UCI: So what facility are you calling from?</br></br>
Caller: Deuel Vocational Institution, DVI. That’s the acronym.</br></br>
UCI: Perfect, thank you so much. Okay so go ahead and-</br></br>
Caller: Can you understand-</br></br>
UCI: Oh, go ahead, sorry, what was your question?</br></br>
Caller: Can you understand me? Because I got on two masks.</br></br>
UCI: Yes, I can hear you just fine. If you enunciate a little bit, but you should be fine. I can hear you just clearly.</br></br>
Caller: Good deal. Thank you, Erin, you say, right?</br></br>
UCI: Yeah, that’s me! So, let’s go ahead and get started. Tell me about what it's been like during the pandemic.</br></br>
Caller: Initially, it was a shock. Because I knew that the pandemic was worldwide. I had never anticipated or even expected the pandemic to hit the prison system.</br></br>
And in three months, during the initial or statewide initialization of the pandemic, I became a little more concerned. Not for me or fellow prisoners, but for family members, the community at large, and the general public.</br></br>
And then, when the numbers started finalizing in states. Particularly here in California, and I see the numbers continue to gravitate toward unprecedented amounts. I became really concerned. So, the graduation of concern, and intrigue, and [unintelligible].</br></br>
And the president, Donald Trump, didn’t help a lot because he discounted a lot of the things. And seemed to basically set a precedent which I didn’t understand. But then when it started hitting the- infecting the prisons, I learned about that particular aspect or source of information from the San Quentin News, which is a prisoner-generated publication.</br></br>
And the numbers was really frightening, because- also I’m in here on a three-strikes, property crime. I became concerned about my public- my personal safety because also I’m doing a life sentence, I didn’t wanna be, I don't wanna die in prison.</br></br>
Particularly knowing that the prison officials, the correction officials, and even administrators, they do not have a high standard of PPEs and other cleaning agents that the public at large is using. Such as sanitizing, masks were just given, initially we were given cloth masks. Now we’re finally given N95 masks, or what they’re calling KN95 masks, but it still left me with a great amount of concern. Particularly because the prison officials warn that the facility is scheduled to be shut down.</br></br>
So what they seem to be doing is creating a crisis situation by withholding more PPEs and cleaning agents. So it’s become perpetually disconcerting that public servants, who are paid by the taxpayers, are perpetuating a mass pandemic in the midst of a pandemic.</br></br>
So I’m really concerned about my personal safety, and the safety of others, of course. But mine personally because I don’t know if the same fellow inmates have the same amount of reservation and the level of concern that I’m exhibiting.</br></br>I’ve been filing grievances with the prison officials, and they're discounting them, of course. There’s no real social distancing in prison because now they’re making us take on double-cells in a massive size cell, and we’re in there 23 hours a day. And we’ve got poor ventilation, and this prison that I’m in, it was built in the 1940s.</br></br>
Please know that I am not a victim. I’m just trying not to be victimized. I don’t know if that makes a great deal of sense.</br></br>
My hope and concern is that the staff will take this seriously, because they’re not taking it seriously. Until they take it serious, there’s gonna be- this could be my final resting place. And that’s my concern, Erin. Because I got several petitions in the courts, where I could possibly go home within the next year, God willing.</br></br>
But with this pandemic and the variants, and all these ongoing battles, with the administration and signing various paperwork, it’s like I’m losing. I’m trying to stay encouraged, I’m trying to stay comforted, but the staff are not helping in this pandemic.</br></br>
They’re literally not giving us any cleaning agents, and cleaning agents that they give us is watered down. We’ve got a four-man shower, and close to, I wanna say 120 guys use it every other day, and it gets cleaned maybe once a week. So there’s- it’s really filthy.</br></br>
And the staff are just, the other- and it’s really a racial thing. That’s what I want to emphasize. ‘Cause the whites, who have white officers here, the Hispanics got Hispanic officers here, but there’s a low representation of Black officers who could give voice to- well even if I tell ‘em, “look, as a Black man, I’m concerned that the shower situations, they’re not getting cleaned.”</br></br>
They said “Mr. Inmate,” you know, ‘cause you don’t really use my name, “well we don’t want you to- we don’t have anything to give you. ‘Till we have something to give you, what can we tell you?” So I have to take my personal cleaning agents and clean the shower.</br></br>
And I’m a porter, means I’m basically an industrial janitor. And they will, they give me- that’s why I can say, speak from firsthand experience that they’re not trying to give us anything to help us offset any pandemic. It’s like they want us to die in here, or they want us to be confrontational.</br></br>
But again, please know, I am not a victim. I just don’t want to be victimized.</br></br>
UCI: Yeah, I mean- oh, go ahead.</br></br>
Caller: I’m out here now watching them bring, they just brought like 25 inmates in from another building. Now, they don’t warn us. Only thing they do is compacting more inmates, and they're making socially distance hard.</br></br>
And the institution I’m in is DVI. Deuel Vocational Institution. This institution is being shut down. There’s currently four wings, or buildings, that are- that’s totally empty.</br></br>
They could effectively socially distance each individual inmate here. But because they’re cutting down on staff, they’re basically corralling us to one area. Which makes social distance impossible. And that’s what--we’re confined to our cells 24 hours a day. Only time we’re let out is for a shower. They’re not giving us yard exercise.</br></br>
So it really is, it’s really a place where it’s really infested with a lot of germs, a lot of anxiety, a lot of misery, and a lot of combativeness and confrontations. Not only between inmates and staff, but between staff and staff, or between inmate and inmate. I watched two female staff members become real confrontational on the floor in front of us.</br></br>
And when I said something to one of ‘em in hopes that, that they would- the confrontation would cease, I became the target of their violent propensities. So, there are worse things, the staff here are worse than the inmates.</br></br>
At least with the inmates I know what to expect, but with the staff, I don’t know what to expect. Again, I am not a victim, I just do not want to be victimized.</br></br>
UCI: Hmmm. That’s- I really appreciate, you know, you sharing what’s going on, because that’s not something, you know, we’re hearing right now. With, you know, the prison system, where, you know, you’re having this very interesting time. Where your facility’s being shut down, and how that’s being handled. Like I guess the watering down of, you know, PPE, that’s kind of a big deal, especially right now.</br></br>
Is there anything you do to cope with being in your cell 24 hours a day? And then, you know, I know you say you filed grievances. And you also said those aren’t being, you know, heard, or they can take a very long time to get processed and to be acknowledged. So is there anything you do in the meantime to be able to cope? Are you able to call your family?</br></br>
Caller: Up until- I haven’t talked to my mom, my elderly mom, in over a month. I was supposed to talk- I was trying to call her today but she didn’t answer. I do a lot of praying. I do a lot of meditating on the word.</br></br>
I don’t do no- I’m not religious, but I am spiritual. I don’t believe in religion because religion is an attempt to reach God. And my spirituality is based upon my relationship with Christ Jesus, who I call on continuously, on a continuum, because that’s my only refuge.</br></br>
That’s my only source of comfort in a post-pandemic, it’s the times uncertain out there, so you can imagine how it is in here. I wanna- I was gonna write what I’m telling you and be a little more specific, because I think my story needs to be- I need to really get my voice, Erin.</br></br>UCI: Yeah, absolutely.</br></br>Caller: I need to be a voice of reason.</br></br>UCI: Yeah, absolutely. If- do you have our address, before it cuts me off?</br></br>Caller: Yes I do, it’s, P.O. box-</br></br>
