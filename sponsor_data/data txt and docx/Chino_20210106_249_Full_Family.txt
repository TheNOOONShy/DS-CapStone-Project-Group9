Chino, CA 91708</br></br>If Not Now, When?</br></br>Everything in the world has changed as a result of COVID-19, but the American narrative of prison remains. The way governments exercise control, the way citizens describe personal boundaries, the way the economy is run, the way people practice their particular religion, the way schools are organized, the way businesses reach customers, the way courts are conducted, the way militaries are operated. All have changed.</br></br> 

These are institutions and ideals that have been around for centuries.</br></br>
 Yet, what prisons are, and how they are understood, has not been affected. What does this say about America’s ability to confront injustice?</br></br>

What about loving thy neighbor and forgiveness? If COVID can’t change it, what will it take?
