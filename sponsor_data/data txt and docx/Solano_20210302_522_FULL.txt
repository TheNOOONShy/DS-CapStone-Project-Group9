Dear PrisonPandemic,</br></br>


The truth is I would like to get to know you but what you are doing is great. I’m a 79 year old black man who has been in prison 47 years on a crime I did not commit, so COVID-19 is not a big change for me, for almost 80 years I have lived under COVID-19 procedures in that all my life I have lived where there was a sign or rule that kept me from being free to function in what one might call a normal-manner.</br></br>


Brain-washing is a wicked and dangerous thing. I went to a all black school from first to fourth, a all white school from fifth to sixth, and a integrated school from seventh to 11 and got my diploma in a California YA. I grew up and lived around people who have been brainwashed to believe that the amount of melanin in your skin had something to do with your intellect or your station in life.</br></br>


The only thing bad or different for me with COVID-19 is people dying, otherwise to me it’s no big thing. I have tested positive but like when I had a bad case of the flu, I’m fine now.</br></br>


This prison has no idea what they are doing. I am being held in a building numbered 15, in what they call dorm three bed six. We are told to wear our mask in the 2,000 foot day room but it’s okay for 12 man to go maskless in a 30 x 25 foot dorm.</br></br>


They have move me eight times in less than six months. In fact that is how I tested positive. They moved a man from Folsom who was positive, into dorm nine where I was at the time.</br></br>


They allow staff to work in both buildings that have inmates who have tested positive, then go work in a building with inmates who have not tested positive and a few days ago, they moved 11 inmates out of 15 building where they held me, who had not tested and some who still refuse to be tested.</br></br>


I’m an old man and when I move I must push a 1,000 pound cart, so I lost my good job because I would not volunteer to move from 15 building 22 building. Just a few months ago, they moved all the PiA laundry workers off yard D and moved them to C yard. Putting all the PiA laundry washing on one yard. Then a few days ago they moved all who volunteered to, D yard, that is all PiA laundry workers. I did not volunteer because I almost died when I was forced to push a 1,000 pound cart a full half a mile from B yard’s gym to 15 building. I love my job but I love my life more.</br></br>


My family sends me a newsletter that tell what’s going on with CDCR and the newsletter would be saying no buses were carrying inmates from one prison to the next but I would see from my job up to 20 buses go in and out from RxR with inmates going both ways.</br></br>


You were asking how I feel and how has it been inside during the pandemic. Well I’m the lucky one, I have family who still love me after 47 years in prison, working every day at getting back to all of them is why I call myself lucky, I’m a family guy so the pandemic did not change much for me. On the street when not at work, I would be with my family, so since being in here and not being able to be with my family, I’m really a loner. So keeping inside is really part of my normal life, I would rather be alone than to be around 99% of California inmate.</br></br>


They too are part of the brain washed public. Don’t get me wrong, I have been brainwashed too but I knew it and I know the world is not flat. I know the sun don’t rise, the sun is stationary and we on earth rotate on the earth’s axis into the light of the sun and we brainwashed people call it sunrise. And just like we take that common used term for granted, so it is, we have other more harmful things we believe in.</br></br>


Such a herd-immunity is how you control a pandemic best. That is what CDCR is working on by moving us around to make sure we get up to 75% positive, then they will be satisfied. I say this because I have seen and be forced to move into places where they knew had inmates who was tested positive with inmates who was not tested or was tested and was not positive but put us all together.</br></br>


I don’t feel at all safe, not the way they are moving me around. I was safe at work, where I was allowed to dress up in what look like a space suit. Or in the PiA laundry, I help wash clothes of inmates who had died from COVID-19 but my 4 bosses would fire anyone who was seen or reported to be without their glasses on mask but if I go sit with an inmate at a 36” x 36” table with my mask off, they would only say keep your mask on if you are in the day room. Plus there is really no place to stand in any building of CSP-Solano were you can be six feet from anyone.</br></br>


I don’t do anonymous. I stand by every word on these four pages and hope you do put my full name, number and address on anything you do put on your website. If I thought you really were going to put these four pages on a website I would ask my family to go on that site because everything on these pages have already been told to them.</br></br>


Thank you for your time and concern.</br></br>


Yours truly.</br></br>


They came by at 10:30 and ask me if I wanted a shot. I told them no because I already had the disease and don’t feel I need a shot.</br></br>


P.S. - and unless they make me take on, I won’t.
