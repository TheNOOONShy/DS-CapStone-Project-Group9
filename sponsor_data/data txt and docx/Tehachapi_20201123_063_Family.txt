Now during this time of COVID, a sense of fear has been added to my daily life not for myself but for my loved ones. I still have family there for me throughout the years and even though I’ve lost many since, it's the worst feeling in the world, for one to go through a loss while incarcerated. I worry for my parents who are elderly and at risk at this moment of the sickness doing damage. I try not to think negatively throughout these circumstances, I think it will be all over soon, and we’ll count our blessings, and mourn our losses but the day will be bright.
