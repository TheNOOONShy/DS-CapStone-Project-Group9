This letter was written by a person incarcerated at CIW (California Institution for Women).</br></br>And one friend in this prison, an inmate, she passed away from COVID in June. I’m in an outpatient medical unit and we are single-celled. That is the only reason I’m safe out here.</br></br>

All the general population have cellmates still, and the staff used to crowd up in their offices without masks on. They basically brought it in the prison to the inmates and they are still doing it today. That’s why our warden resigned and one of our correction officers walked off.</br></br>

It’s terrible here. So all the inmates are quarantined, and that means no food, no laundry, barely any canteen. And we are three months behind on our quarterly packages that we get from outside vendors, because they have no help to pull the orders from the warehouse to the property room.</br></br>

And then they are opening people’s packages illegally, and then they are trying to tape it back together, and we have no warden to complain to. And the governor is too busy to hear what the hell is going on. So I’m glad you don’t mind. I’m stressed out, and I really needed that.
