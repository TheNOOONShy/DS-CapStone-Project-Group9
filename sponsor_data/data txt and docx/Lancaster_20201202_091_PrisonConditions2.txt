Although there has not been a massive outbreak here, I have been noticing that the conditions are substandard.</br></br>

We are not given disinfectant that kills coronavirus - or anything else on a regular basis. We should be given Pinesol, which has been proven to kill coronavirus on a weekly basis- and each cell should get either Lysol or an effective hand sanitizer.</br></br> 

In the building, we have one bottle of hand sanitizer on the podium for the entire building.</br></br> 

We should be given be given antibacterial or antiviral hand soap, not bar soap. Bar soap that is made by PIA clogs the sinks and that leaves stagnant water in our sinks. Dove hand soap does go down the drain, but they stopped giving that to us.
