Fellow PrisonPandemic Project Team Members,</br></br>

I would first like to thank you for reaching out to me, however I was added to your mailing list, it's a blessing, and a privilege to be able to share my personal insight, and experience inside the belly of the beast, as we often describe it in the penitentiary. I'll take any human being able to handle my writings, on a journey that may put a virtual reality headset to shame.</br></br>

I've been incarcerated for 14 years, after being arrested at the age of 13 years old for a bevy of violent home invasion robberies. Growing up in Southern California, as a young person of color, with no true direction of what it meant to be a success, left me destitute, with no moral compass, motivated to destroy any and everything in my path.</br></br>

Imagine that everything you ever chose to chase away was leading you on the darkest path of disaster.</br></br>

Being treated as an adult at 13 years of age, because you were quiet, intelligent, and mature for your age. Yet, inside you cry. Cry at the thought of seeing people you went to elementary school with, murdered, while attempting to be a positive light to those left remaining.</br></br>

Although the term pandemic, is defined as a widespread outbreak of disease, my experiences were difficult prior to COVID-19, which is worth mentioning.</br></br>

One supreme positive I've learned presently, if you can't find peace in yourself, especially in these times, where will you find it? I genuinely believe in finding the positive within the most dire circumstances! Taking the first step with a good thought. I urge all, to make finding peace within themselves a priority.</br></br>

The challenges within the COVID-19 pandemic showed me personally, the importance of pursuing internal peace. And yet, at times I'm depressed, sitting in the complete darkness of a 4X4 prison cell. I feel my heart literally beating two times faster than it has ever had before I was incarcerated. Especially having done the majority of my prison sentence within maximum security prisons.</br></br>

When the pandemic began globally, it turned 22 hours already in a cell, to a complete 24 hour day! Isolated. Not being able to consistently communicate with your loved ones, it's very damaging psychologically!</br></br>

Your mind begins to play tricks on you, questioning whether they really care for you, or if you should burden them with a depressing prison call, complaining of constant injustice, and oppression.</br></br>

Picture this.</br></br>

Staring at yourself in a mirror for an hour, not recognizing yourself, your eyes appearing completely blacked out, as if you are possessed by something supernatural! At every slight headache, cough, sneeze, you convince yourself that you have Covid-19, and that you will expire in prison.</br></br>

At the end of 2020, I was told that one of my siblings contracted Covid-19 and had began quarantine at my mother's home. I was completely terrified! Not being able to call daily, worrying if everyone was okay.</br></br>

Also, with them living in the state of Pennsylvania, it makes it feel as if it's a foreign county in regard to the distance between us. I honestly don't feel as if I'm coping, more like survival of the fittest!</br></br>

In retrospect though, my overall nature, spirit, and character is of positive and righteous quality. We all shall prevail stronger after these historical, and unseen times. I read something that was very inspiring to me, I want to share with anyone it may empower.</br></br>

Until you can stand alone, looking for guidance neither to spirits nor mortals, gods nor men, but guiding yourself by the light of the truth within you, you are not unfettered and free, not altogether blessed, find the joy that results from well-earned freedom, the peace that flows from self-possession, the blessedness that inheres in native strength.</br></br>

Spirituality isn't just a particular religion, it's about having supreme faith in something greater than yourself, your problems, and circumstances. Life is a journey, a marathon. Love the blessings you have in your life, regardless of your physical position, financial status, or mistakes you've made!</br></br>

The COVID-19 pandemic has brought me to a more positive realization, of these important principles.</br></br>

Love someone</br></br>

Grow with someone</br></br>

Help someone</br></br>

Talk to someone</br></br>

And understand that the storm of this pandemic is evanescent.</br></br>

Although I'm physically incarcerated through the COVID-19 pandemic, I will remain focused, determined to be a better man through my redemption journey. I'm an avid realist.</br></br>

Anyone can reach out to me, write me. We have a lot to offer each other during this pandemic, and life in its entirety.</br></br>

Truly,</br></br>

Sincerely,</br></br>

Peace, Love, and Wisdom.
