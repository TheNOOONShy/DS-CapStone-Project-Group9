This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Pleasant Valley.</br></br>

My property stacked on a dayroom table, I told my neighbor in the next cell that I had tested positive and volunteered to cell with me in quarantine, "Let's take the last cart. I'm in no hurry to get over there and don't want my belongings mixed in with other prisoners."</br></br> 

The third time the carts came back, we loaded up and wheeled our way to the COVID-19 housing unit. Just pushing the cart 100 yards or so, we were both out of breath and feeling tired. We were given PPE to wear in the housing units, masks, gowns, face shields, assigned cells on the top tier of the mostly empty housing unit. We stacked our property on the tier and I could see water marks on the cell wall and thought the cell must leak when it rained.
