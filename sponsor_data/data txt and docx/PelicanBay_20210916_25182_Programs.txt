This story was told by a person incarcerated at Pelican Bay.</br></br> 

UCI: Awesome. Okay. So, tell me what it's been like.</br></br>

Caller: Honestly, it's like usual day for me. It's not that hard. It hasn't been difficult.</br></br>

UCI: What has the COVID situation been like at the facility?</br></br>

Caller: Well, they'll be letting us out for like a week or two. Then they slam it down again, you know? It's been on and off for a while.</br></br>

UCI: Oh, interesting. Okay. And has programming been restarted?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah. We get like an hour yard time, like an hour and a half. Sometimes two, two and a half hours. It depends, you know? Sometimes there's not enough floor staff, so they just give us a little concrete yard in here. You know, it's been okay.</br></br>

UCI: And have they started any sort of classes or letting you use any of the library or books, anything like that?</br></br>

Caller: Well, everything has to be ... They'll deliver, they'll deliver the books to our cells. They haven't opened anything yet. They do, they barely opened school, but we don't go to school, though. They'll send everything to our cells, you know?</br></br>

UCI: Oh.</br></br>

Caller: Like homework, stuff like that.</br></br>

UCI: Okay. So, you're still pretty much in your cell, except for the yard time.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah. Yeah.</br></br>

UCI: So, have you been able to see your loved ones?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah. About a week ago, they opened, they gave us the big yard and everything. But two, three days ago, they slammed it down again, you know? Because of the variants that's going on out there right now.</br></br>

UCI: And so, how long would you say that you had somewhat of programming restarted before they shut everything down again?</br></br>

Caller: Well, yesterday, they gave us a little, like, hour and a half yard time, you know? And today, they were going to give us yard today but they changed their minds. So, we might get some tomorrow. It depends.</br></br> 

You know, sometimes they don't have enough floor staff. So, they just shut the program down.
