This story was told by a person incarcerated at Amador County Jail.</br></br>

UCI: Please, tell me your COVID story by beginning what facility are you currently housed at?

Caller: I'm currently housed at Amador County Jail.</br></br>

UCI: Awesome.</br></br>

Caller: And then, it's terrible in here, man, you know.</br></br>

UCI: Dude, I've been hearing nothing but that. Please, tell me, like, what's going on. Like.</br></br>

Caller: Like, they take away our visits. We have no visits. We can't even see our people, you know. They try to say that they're giving these tablets, and they've been giving these tablets for years, and not one of us have gotten no tablets. That way we can't visit our people or talk to our people, you know.</br></br>

We can't even go outside and have sunlight, you know. They got this tent on our yard that hasn't had one inmate there that had COVID the whole time. They bring people that have COVID into this jail and they say that â€“ they don't test them or nothing.</br></br>

They bring them in here and they say it's for the tent, that that's where people are supposed to go, you know. So, we got to sit here and stress over COVID. And the fact that we can't talk to our children and see our loved ones, you know, it's just a terrible thing. And when we try to grieve it or fight it they go against us, you know.</br></br>

There's, it's not - there's a couple of officers that are actually really, really alright, you know. But, it's just been a real messed up experience and stressful experience for all of us.</br></br>

UCI: Hey, thank you for sharing at least that much with me, I really appreciate it.
