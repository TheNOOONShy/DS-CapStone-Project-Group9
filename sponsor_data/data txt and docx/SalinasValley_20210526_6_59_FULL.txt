This story was told by a person incarcerated at Salinas Valley.</br></br>


Caller: Hello?</br></br>


UCI: Hello, thank you for calling PrisonPandemic.</br></br>


Caller: Well, I received this letter that basically you guys sent right?</br></br>


UCI: Yeah.</br></br>


Caller: And well I’m writing the letter and trying to make it like three pages, for you guys can do whatever you guys doing. I also do some drawings and Indian beads.</br></br>


UCI: Oh awesome!</br></br>


Caller: I do some Indian beads and [unintelligible] and braces and necklaces right, so I’m gonna send you one pair of each one for you guys could do whatever you guys do with it, you know?</br></br>


UCI: Okay, great. Did you want to share your story over the phone too? Or do you want me, like tell you some of the questions we usually ask, if you want to incorporate that into the letter?</br></br>


Caller: Um, what? Like questions? I don’t know if you guys want to ask questions? That’s cool, you know? I’m writing whatever. That’s cool, you guys understand Spanish too?</br></br>


UCI: Yeah, yeah.</br></br>


Caller: So.</br></br>


UCI: Yeah you can write in Spanish or you can call in Spanish.</br></br>


Caller: No, it’s more easy for me to express myself in Spanish than English right, cause basically.</br></br>


UCI: Okay.</br></br>


Caller: I grew up angry, you know? I’ve been in here since I was 16 years old so.</br></br>


UCI: Wow, yeah. Did you want to write, so you’re only writing in right?</br></br>


Caller: Excuse me?</br></br>


UCI: You’re only writing in or did you want to tell me your story too over the phone?</br></br>


Caller: Well I’m writing it so I can send you some.</br></br>


UCI: Okay.</br></br>


Caller: Some drawings, and some of the jewelry that I’m making.</br></br>


UCI: Okay.</br></br>


Caller: It’s basically Indian beads, but basically I can tell you what is going on in here, what it’s been like, you know?</br></br>


UCI: Okay, so basically.</br></br>


Caller: I don’t know.</br></br>


UCI: Yeah, so if you’re writing to us already, that’s great. Like if you already started writing, but I mean I can take your story over the phone if you want. I have to do a consent process or if you wanna just write. Did you want me to like tell you some of the questions usually like that we ask people?</br></br>


Caller: Yeah that’s cool. I can answer.</br></br>


UCI: Yeah, like today, I won’t record our conversation because I didn’t read you the consent form, and since you already started writing to us, I’ll just read you the questions and then if you want to include that into the paper, into your papers?</br></br>


Caller: Yeah.</br></br>


UCI: Okay. So usually we ask “how has the vaccination situation been like at your facility?” “How has the COVID situation affected your loved ones, what has it been like for you to have reduced visitation and programing, how are you coping with the crisis?” and “What else, what do you want people to know about your experience?” So those are usually the things that we ask everyone, you know, if we have time on the phone call.</br></br>


Caller: Well for me, I don’t have no problem to, for you guys to put whatever I’m doing, because it’s nothing but the truth you know what I mean? I mean I’m not lying or anything.</br></br>


UCI: Yeah.</br></br>


Caller: Anything that I’m saying or putting in there, right. Basically, the vaccines and the shots, I got my two already, but there’s a lot of people that they don’t want to take it but.</br></br>


UCI: Did you want me to record the conversation? So that you can, so that we can.</br></br>


Caller: If you want, it’s only like 15 minutes, if you want you can record as much as you can record and then I’m gonna send the letters too anyway.</br></br>


UCI: Perfect, perfect. Okay I have to go over the consent process with you right now so that I can actually like record it. Is that okay?</br></br>


Caller: Yeah.</br></br>


UCI: [redacted].</br></br>


Caller: Okay, it is May, 2021.</br></br>


Caller: Yes I’m answering you these questions exactly on my birthday and you want me to tell you? How it’s been like?</br></br>


UCI: Yes, go ahead, anything that you’d like to share.</br></br>


Caller: Well for me, the vaccines, it took a minute, because even the sheriffs took people out  there first so right here we had to wait, and as people getting sick we had to be waiting for the shots and the vaccines so. People getting sick in these buildings and they were moved to a different building to isolate them and removed them for remove them for us.</br></br>


But basically two months ago I got my two shots for Moderna, and I’m thankful to the United States who came out with this shot, you know what I mean. And I got my shots so I’m good right now, with that. And as for my family, well I haven’t seen my family over, probably right now, over two years you know cause they cancelled our visits.</br></br>


Well I haven’t got a visit, for a while so what they did in here, they create a, like a video visits. Basically like facetime, you could be able to see them and they see you, so they came out with that and they were able to give us 30 minutes but it’s hard to get an appointment for us, so I haven’t even gotten one of those because it’s so hard.</br></br>


They keep changing the application and we keep having trouble with that for a long time, and right now I’m basically, they’re giving us like regular, normal visits, they’re giving us like two hour visits. And you go out there and you have your people one-time and that’s it. They’re not selling you food or nothing, and they’re not letting in kids or young ones come in for the moment so.</br></br>


We waited for next month, they might come back to normal. I guess the whole state will be normal, as long as they do that, they will change it in here too. And this pandemic came to affect us in real life, I read the bible a lot so I believe in God and Jesus Christ and these things.</br></br>


They even, on the scripts of the bible, they say like times will come with infections and things like that to our lives because there’s things, not just us in here but in the whole world, because we don’t take care of this planet, you know? So I believe in the bible for me, we all did things to ourselves, to this planet, so we gotta take care most of this planet, so we won’t have no more stuff happening in this world to us, you know.</br></br>


And that being about it, and like I said because it’s hard for us because this happened and they locked it down, we’re not able to come out. At the beginning when this thing happened they just locked us up, they put us in our cells and that’s it. Stay in your house, don’t come out for nothing.</br></br>


They didn’t want to give us no shower, no phone calls, and they didn’t want to sell us no canteen, or nothing so we had to fight for that and push paperwork so they could start selling us canteen and let us out to shower like every other day or every three days and then give us a phone call everyday but it worked because we’re getting a phone call everyday and shower every two, three days.</br></br>


But like I said, sometimes these keep happening to us because there’s people in here, they don’t really care, they think this stuff is a game. When everything happened out there, there’s people that didn’t believe it, they don’t think, you know?</br></br>


UCI: Yeah, how have you been coping with everything?</br></br>


Caller: What happened?</br></br>


UCI: How have you been coping with everything?</br></br>


Caller: Well right now it’s much, much better you know? We used to go to the recreation yard, it’s our building, and to go outside, to exercise, get some fresh air, but now there’s two buildings that go at a time, you know? So we’ve been dealing with things much, much better.</br></br>


UCI: Yeah.</br></br>


Caller: Low stress.</br></br>


Caller:  In here, basically there’s people, they’re not, we were not prepared for this, but there’s a lot of people, they don’t know how to do nothing here, and they just stay in their cells, and stress, and then watch T.V. too much, for the stress. And me, I keep to read my bible and like I said, I’ve been in here 22 years, and I learned how to draw and how to do things to keep my mind busy and focused, you know?</br></br>


UCI: And you’re at the Salinas facility, right?</br></br>


Caller: Yeah I’m in Salinas.</br></br>


UCI: Okay.</br></br>


Caller: Yeah I just got this letter too, about a week ago. Cause this mail, you could send a letter for you guys’ facility or for you guys’ school. You could send a letter and it comes in here fast like two days but then they take their time because they gotta open it and they go through it sometimes. Sometimes it’s just sitting there and they pass them out when they feel like it, you know?</br></br>


UCI: Yeah and then when you send your letters, it takes approximately up to a month and a half for it to be processed, and then we will send you something back, just so you know that we’ve received your letter.</br></br>


Caller: Okay, well like I said when I put it in, I’m gonna put it in a big envelope cause I’m gonna send the drawings. I draw on a handkerchief. So it will be on a handkerchief and I’m gonna put a pair of earrings and do a necklace and a brace, with beadings you know so, you guys can  put it in there together. So however you guys want to place it in your guys’ story or.</br></br>


UCI: Awesome, is there anything else you’d like to share today?</br></br>


Caller: Uh huh, well you guys can ask questions and I can answer more questions, if that’s more easier, me answering whatever you guys need to put in there. Well the time is going to be up anyway so.</br></br>


UCI: Yeah.</br></br>


Caller: I’ll try to work on my letter and after I’ll be sending it in or as soon as I’m done with it, I’ll send it to you guys.</br></br>


UCI: Great, and if you ever feel like adding more to the letter or anything like that, you could you know, write again and everything as well. Thank you so much for calling PrisonPandemic today, if you want to have your friends call in, in English or Spanish, we have the consent form as well in Spanish.</br></br> 


Caller: Okay, well I appreciate you accepting this call, and you guys have a great day. Stay safe out there, okay?</br></br>


UCI: Thank you, you too.</br></br>


Caller: And God Bless you.</br></br>


UCI: Igualmente. Bye.</br></br>


Caller: Okay, bye, adios.
