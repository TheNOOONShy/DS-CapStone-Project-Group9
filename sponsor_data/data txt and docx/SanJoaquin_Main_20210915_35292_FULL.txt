This story was told by an incarcerated individual at San Joaquin County Jail.</br></br>

UCI: And you're calling from San Joaquin, right?</br></br>

Caller: Yes, I am.</br></br>

UCI: Perfect. Okay.</br></br>

Caller: Okay. So I wrote a story last night about – what is it here – 14 pages. It's a little about – bit about – it's mostly, like, how things were for me when I came into jail and how things changed while I'm here and, like, the person that I'll leave here as being because of what has transpired. It tells you a little bit more about myself.</br></br>

There's a few pages in here where I was even hesitant and I want that written I was even hesitant to read you guys these stories because it – I really respect you guys and I want to think – I want you to like me because I really respect you guys and I – and – but, yeah, there's maybe a few pages in here of a period of time where I'm maybe not so proud of my actions. </br></br>

Things could have been different, maybe a little better than they were, but I did it my way. But I, so, it's, like, I'm – I'm glad to read it to you anyway because, you know, I don't like – I don't like – I don't want to sit here and present myself as a perfect person; you know? I have flaws and just a man like any man – no better, no worse. And I do think – and to not say it, I'd just be lying to you all, so I'm going to go ahead and read this to you now. I hope you enjoy it. And it's nice talking to you again, by the way. Okay.</br></br>

I call this one [redacted]. And I just finished it just last six pages in the last hour or so, so hopefully I didn't have a chance to read them over. Hopefully they're written well and can read through it easy, but, okay, here we go. I call this [redacted]. I would like to tell you a quick story about the man I was when I first came to jail, how things have changed for me, and the man I am today.</br></br>

The man that re-entered this jail two and a half months ago was tired. He was tired and rigid from the hardships and strain of the last year and a half as – oh, I'm sorry. The man that re-entered this jail two and a half months ago, he was tired and rigid from the hardships and strain that this last year and a half has been for all of us I'm sure.</br></br>

Sometimes I feel that it's the children that have suffered the most. It's those times when they're – when they're young that are so vital and important to their development I often wonder if it's the socializing and the human interaction that is – that is the most vital of all things for us in building character and being able to appreciate this life for what it's worth as my babies were forced to be without it for almost two years.</br></br>

It has been so, so hard for me to watch them go through the last two years and all that they've been forced to endure due to my struggles. By going through their worst relationships one could ever know, with the constantly drawing my attention away from my children which was something new for both me and my kids as they have always been the center of my attention.</br></br>

But I somehow allowed for this situation to get the better of me. And then added to the – and then added to that was strain of being now a single parent father as their mother, true to form, took this opportunity – took this – took this as an opportunity just go worry about nothing more than herself which is why – which is how it always was and is why I had to leave her.</br></br>

I'll tell you, I'd say I'd be lying if I – if I didn't tell you how hard it is for me to keep things the way it should be for these kids. [unintelligible] I've been scraping by as a bit of a failure. I mean, it's not easy. It's not easy at all right now being me.</br></br>

I [unintelligible] desperately need to find this life partner and soulmate I've [unintelligible] somewhere out there - there has to be this woman for me. There has to be [unintelligible] in my situation and just give a shit, especially with all I have to offer [unintelligible] maintain such a heavy stream of income allowing for us to have whatever we want when we want it and do whatever we want when we want with the proper planning and scheduling, of course. But that's normal.</br></br>

But I got to tell you, between trying to stay on top of their virtual schooling and on Skype and homework are the occasional slash now full-time getting them all to and from school combined with me owning and operating my own construction business, all these deadlines of having ten jobs going at a time, while just making sure I pay all the bills and having – having forgotten something.</br></br>

Then there's all the cooking and grocery shopping [unintelligible] cats and dogs and still have time for some good parenting with also being able to tuck them in at night, I tell you, [unintelligible] like no matter how hard I try I [unintelligible] and then I just feel like a big failure and I hate it.</br></br>

I want to do so well for my children [unintelligible] be better. I just have to slow down a – a bit and focus on the big picture and take it [unintelligible] there has been far too many days in the last year where I'd come home a bit late, too late from work or a date, perhaps, and the kids are already asleep, and my daughter has already fed everybody and got [unintelligible] but my heart just sinks.</br></br>

I know I can do so much better. I just have to stay focused and not get distracted in a world where everything is one big diversion pulling me away from what I cherish the most. That's why I needed to find just that one right woman for me for the benefit of both me and my family allowing me to stay focused and channel all my efforts one way back towards the family – my family the way it's always been. But in light of what's happening – I'm sorry.</br></br>

But in light of what's happened recently with me pulling away from two unhealthy relationships in a row with women that would rather be on drugs instead of being a family, and I'll tell you right now, I don't do drugs, I'll never do drugs again in my life, and I don't want – and I don't and won't properly associate with anyone who does. I did try using drugs for a few months during the last year of my life, and it was a horrible experience. I've never felt worse and I'll never do it again. Such a waste of time.</br></br>

And, of course, the worst possible diversion for me taking care of my [unintelligible] and that just made me [unintelligible] so now in a way been left actually being a little bit bitter and [unintelligible] with the – the whole concept [unintelligible] people choose by way of doing drugs, it has all made me a bit angry, actually, and I don't wish [unintelligible] of hate inside me, but that – that [unintelligible] touched me in the worst way leaving me [unintelligible] that I let it happen because I grew up in that world.</br></br>

And I'm not naïve. I've always known better. So with that and coming out of a total of 22 years straight of being in a constant relationship between these two women, and now being single for the first time in my entire adult life, enough said; right? I could probably just stop there.</br></br>

But being with my overall status of who I am and having acquired all these things like what was now the ultimate bachelor pad as being a five bedroom brand new house with the most beautiful amenities like [unintelligible] cabinets, granite countertops, [unintelligible] lighting, nice tile and carpet floors with a huge open design with me then doing my part and furnishing it with all the fixings of, for instance, a $7,000 imported Italian leather couch with the – with power seating, $800 imported rugs, $2,000 in bed frames, $5,000 worth of art on the wall, $2,000 kitchen tables [unintelligible] and anything as well as everything you could ever want including thousands of dollars' worth of badass [LED] colorful lighting to where I've had the place literally [unintelligible] with 100-inch screen TV [unintelligible] and top – and top of the line sound system [unintelligible] vehicles parked out in front.</br></br>

It's a total paradise minus the one [unintelligible] to really bring it all together is the life I want to live. Oh, I forgot. I really love art and I'm a fantastic artist, so as I have mastered color and how to use it. So there's also this [unintelligible] have a lot of fun with [unintelligible] but it's – but it's [unintelligible] as well as a natural talent for understanding things easily and doing well with it, again, with me becoming single for the first time in late February of this year, maybe March – in late February or maybe March of this year, I opened up my first ever social media account on Facebook and then, of course, Messenger, Instagram, as well as Snapchat, [unintelligible], and it only took me a minute to figure how to make a short video of myself doing something cool.</br></br>

I love making all kinds of videos that [unintelligible] really cool stuff. So then I – so I then do a mass send of that video out to hundreds of women and wait to see what hits. I'd say out of 100 women, 90 will respond. And out of that 90, maybe 50 or 60 might be solid possibilities.</br></br>

And then out of that 50 or 60 women, I can dwindle that down to at least 30 real solid situations that I can then go after. And I could do this every day if I wanted, but it is a lot of work taking up so much time and effort, the biggest diversion ever. It's way too much to ever keep up with. I had 19 and 20-year-olds just hounding me.</br></br>

Apparently, I'm not sure what it means, lol, but I'm referred to as a DILF, but whatever. In full disclosure, I was single for a total of three and a half months before coming in here and I wasted too much time having dated 15 different women at the same time until finally I met what felt like the right one. </br></br>

I said, to heck with this and immediately deleted all contacts and went all in with just her hoping she wasn't going to wind up thinking that I'm some weirdo taking way too – talking way too soon about let's do this kind of thing. But that's just how I am. I'm not afraid to fail if that's what – what it ends up being, and was [unintelligible], so if I felt at all like, oh, damn, this could be it, well, then automatically, she's my only priority in that sense.</br></br>

But we talked for a little – over a week and only got one official date in when – with plans to see each other again the next day, but the next day I also had court, which is when the remanded my bail for having missed court the previous week and took me straight to jail, and I've now been here for two and a half months and having taken my calls twice to inform me that nothing has changed for her, and she's not out there fishing for relationship like I was, and she also apologized for not accepting any of my calls during these two and a half months.</br></br>

And as I call her at least three times a week with her never answering with her having told me it's – it's always bad timing when I call because of work – her work and other things. And I'm totally cool with understanding if she is in any way uncomfortable with taking calls from jail with a guy she just met.</br></br>

But now I'm also faced with the dilemma, this dilemma, and especially with the way my past two relationships were, do I now want to and should I even consider starting this new relationship with this person that's already so easily willing to lie to me out of convenience in saying she was too busy the 30 times I called when I'd rather just have the truth.</br></br>

For a relationship to stand a chance at success, you have to be open and honest [unintelligible] it's a red flag and I'm slightly shaken by it, plus a little frustrated that I have no one to talk to on the phone and I love hearing her voice and this was a hard time for me being here where maybe she should have been there for me. Anyhow, that has – that all has me – okay.</br></br> 

Yeah, anyhow, that has – that all has – any – anyhow, that all has me having entered this whole jail situation a little rigid and uncertain of a lot of things [unintelligible] I feel like when I get out of here in [redacted] days, I only have [unintelligible] thing and that's – and one thing only, and that's – and that's [unintelligible] being – and that's raising my children as being here for two and a half months has helped me get my head straightened out quite a bit.</br></br>

But on the other hand, there, of course, the concept of – the concept of by finding love and being in love, it will dramatically help both me and my family at the same time. So I'm a bit confused and I'm definitely not sure about how any of this might go. But one thing I could tell you that happened to me while I've been locked up in jail this whole [unintelligible] okay.</br></br>

But one thing I can tell you that happened to me while having been locked up in jail this time around, and it's most – and it most definitely is something worth writing about is probably what has turned out to be one of the more inspiring things that has ever happened to me, and that would be to tell you how when I first came into jail I brought with me just four stories that I held close to my heart having written them during my other visits.</br></br>

Originally, [unintelligible] had been written primarily for my family and close friends, but then something very amazing happened where just as I finished writing my latest and greatest story ever called – ever called Faith in Humanity that I was so proud of, the people in my jail pod even began receiving letters from [unintelligible] asking inmates for their stories about the [unintelligible] pandemic expressing their concern for our well-being and about the different ways in which [unintelligible] may have suffered [unintelligible] this as a result with them wanting to - to then take the stories they receive and make their best effort in attempting to change reforms for inmates having true compassion for others and just wanting to help make the world a better place, which is something I can appreciate and value so highly as it's what I'm all about.</br></br>

So with that, I then had inmates running these letters over to me and showing me how cool this was and knowing this was – this was meant for me as for weeks now I had already been passing my stories around the jail to be read as many of these men have now become my friends and I wished to help them – I wished to help them all with their frame of mind and holding proper perspective on things. So when I received this letter, I became very excited [unintelligible] of being able to branch out to a larger audience and having my message heard now by me.</br></br>

It was exactly what I had needed [unintelligible] wanting to do a large amount of good in this world without exactly knowing how. [unintelligible] the possibility of stories being shared – with the possibility of these stories being [unintelligible] an upcoming generation at the time well – while – while they are also able to take their leap and – and making a difference around them.</br></br>

Even further, with these stories now being shared by all future [unintelligible] is – is and was my [unintelligible] it can easily stand as the most divine thing to happen to me. [unintelligible] changed my entire [unintelligible] about things and all the possibilities that may be my future as I am now in debt to them for this inspiring kind gesture that they have extended to all of us in the – in the [unintelligible] improve the world around them.</br></br>

It's a debt I can never stop repaying as they have likely now changed the entire course of my existence with them having inspired me to continue writing and to continue writing in a way I had never done before whereas my first stories had happened as being written one at a time separately over the course of a year or more, but I am now able to write a new story every night with me being able to write 10 to 15 pages a day or more. It's as if I can't stop writing; like, I'll no longer know what to do with myself if I stop.</br></br>

As you get older and [unintelligible], you can easily forget certain times and certain experiences [unintelligible] I'm finding out that if [unintelligible] and even then as I'm writing these stories about my life, remembering [unintelligible] some things as I go.[unintelligible] I'm finding out that as – that as I'm coming up with these – with the topic and even as I'm writing these stories about my life that I'm remembering some things as I go – things that are shocking, even for myself, that had been long forgotten almost as if from a past life long ago, and I'm then able to reassociate myself with these parts of myself that I so treasure having lived through and experiences I've had.</br></br>

Especially by writing about so many different times so fast, I'm now able to once again carry with me all those experiences as if they just happened with them all now being centered at the front of my brain all – and daily – at the front of my brain and daily thought process. In a sense, I had now reinforced myself with all that I've ever done and all that I am combined into one in every moment of my day carrying it all with me now with every step I take. It almost feels like some sort of superpower with the life the way I've lived it.</br></br>

It's incredible, really, and has lifted my self-consciousness to a high – to a new level. It's a wonderful feeling being able to express myself so easily and so well, even now having the ability to explain and write about the great pleasure about all the topics I have written, including this very [unintelligible] now writing as I'm writing it feels very special as perhaps it has never [unintelligible] as I once drew a picture inside of a picture of a pitcher taking a [unintelligible] of a picture on a table of a pitcher of beer [unintelligible] and it does this – and so – and so does this here now.</br></br>

It could be a new style of art [unintelligible] in a gallery without title and have [unintelligible] what they think it is. Curious as to how many people could get it completely correct. I believe I [unintelligible] picture when I was 16 – about 16 years old, and I've always been very fond of it, and [unintelligible] having drawn it in the first place.</br></br>

I have not thought about it for [unintelligible] I'm adding to my [unintelligible] now finally having said all that [unintelligible] again, deeply thank [unintelligible] for all that they've done and all that they are doing [unintelligible] a lot of us here – over here whereas for me, I've never enjoyed the experience of having [unintelligible] to wonder what it might have been like for me had I [unintelligible] that I still love to learn [unintelligible] because remember, knowledge is the greatest tool and the greatest strength you could ever [unintelligible] in this life.</br></br>

It is and will always be a true power, and really – and really take the time to value and appreciate where you're at and yourself for being there. We are [unintelligible] doing. You have now single handedly, or at least with all hands combined, changed my life by [unintelligible] changed my life by [unintelligible] – all right.</br></br>

Changed my life by creating this up – an uplifting experience of being here in jail that [unintelligible] otherwise gone to waste. By then, instead, making it so I leave here such a proud man. When we first met I had read for you no more than 40 pages or so – oh, I'm sorry.</br></br>

When we first met, I had ready for you no more than 40 or so pages of literature that I had written to – to read to you and others, but after I finished writing and then telling this story here now – but after I finished writing and then telling this story here now to you, I will have written and read a total of 140 – 140 pages to you that I now carry with me as a book that would have never possibly happened without you.</br></br>

I'm keeping it as a hard cover in the full 8 by 11 inch standard size so that the first 100 or so pages can be the proper reformatted and typed version with the second half immediately thereafter being photocopies of the actual [unintelligible] pencil versions written straight – straight through with – without the luxury of an eraser as written from jail with ten pages [unintelligible] the art on both the front and the back perhaps having a picture [unintelligible] as the back cover as I'm calling it The Eternal Flame Within, The Life and Legacy of a Man Written Fully from Behind Bars which I hope brings some curious appeal to the readers.</br></br>

And I'd want to have – and I want it printed in several different language – languages, and then distributed worldwide. And none of this would have happened without you guys. Hopefully together we will have – we will have helped [unintelligible] around us in whatever way possible. Fingers crossed. So thanks once again. This has been an experience I will forever cherish and hold close to my heart as I carry it with me for the rest of my life. Thank you. And that is all.</br></br>

UCI: Oh, my gosh. That was amazing. Oh, my gosh. We are so grateful –</br></br>

Caller:[crosstalk] –</br></br>

UCI: - for you. That, I mean, you just shared so much with our whole team, and we're just so grateful for that and for you being vulnerable enough to share that. I mean, it's a big deal. So we couldn't have done it without you.</br></br>

Caller: Thank you. I mean, I'll say it again. I mean, [unintelligible] I like – I like what I'm doing here so much [unintelligible] it's like I'm addicted to it. I almost just want to pack up my stuff, considering I'm homeless right now, and just move straight down to Irvine and I'd just be closer to you all [unintelligible] how much I enjoyed this whole experience. But, yeah, I can't wait to get out of here in six days and, like I said, establish myself with [unintelligible] new residence for my children and just get going from there.</br></br>

UCI: Absolutely.</br></br>

Caller: [crosstalk]</br></br>

UCI: And, you know, and just know that, like, this does make a difference to us, too; you know? You telling us tonight that this has power and, you know, how people respond to our letters, that's also really important for us to know, too, because we want to know that we're making a difference. And, so, it's – it's awesome. But we're so grateful for you and all that you've shared from the very beginning; you know? Like, we're just so grateful for it.</br></br>

Caller: I can't even tell you how much this, like, changed my life and how much that means to me. Like, I never expected to have any sort of experience, anything close to this; you know? So it's, yeah, it's – it's really something. It really is. It's amazing.</br></br>

UCI: Well –</br></br>

Caller: Thank you guys enough for having started this whole thing.</br></br>

UCI: Absolutely. Our whole purpose is to, you know, shine light on what it's been like and to create reforms and just, you know, make it known. And, so, you – you're helping that and – and it's a great part of history. So – and we're around, so, like, if anyone else has stories, anything of that nature, please have them –</br></br>

Caller: Okay.</br></br>

UCI: - call us.</br></br>

Caller: Right, right. I got a couple guys that are going to be calling in here in the next couple days. I'm doing what I can, but it's just – for a lot of these people, it's just not their thing. I don't know why, but yeah.</br></br>

UCI: You –</br></br>

Caller: Maybe you'll – you'll hear from a guy that you'll swear you're talking to Morgan Freeman. He's an older black gentleman and super cool, and – and then, yeah, I got this other guy. He's calling in tomorrow hopefully.</br></br>

UCI: That's awesome.</br></br>

Caller: He wants to read his story to me and have me confirm it and check it over for him and then he's going to call in to you guys.</br></br>

UCI: And that's so awesome. And we know it's not everyone's thing and we know that talking or writing letters is being really vulnerable and it's scary and – and, you know, that's really, you know, that's totally understandable. So anytime we get someone that is willing to share, we're just super grateful, and we're so – our whole team is so, so grateful for you; you know? Everybody is just so grateful for you.</br></br>

Caller: That blows me away. It's like I never expected to [unintelligible] so well-received; you know? So [unintelligible] [crosstalk] –</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, it's – you're great. So please call us back if – if you have more stories. You know, like the line is yours, so always call if you have anything to share.</br></br>

Caller: Oh, yeah, yeah. Actually, they – they took my tablet from me ten days ago and I should be getting it back tomorrow, so I'll instantly be able to draw two more stories out of there, although I'm hesitant to even read these stories because, I mean, like one, for instance, is called The Story of Love, and I wrote it straight from jail to my ex just completely depicting, like, how I was feeling and just [unintelligible] all my love for her, talking about forgiveness, and just wanted to carry – push forward, and it's going to be a hard one for me.</br></br>

It – it's going to be a hard one for me, but it's worth having to read through and checking it out [unintelligible] I can't even remember what I wrote in it. But I know it opens well and it's very descriptive about the whole jail setting here, and I [unintelligible] for that matter at least, so [crosstalk] –</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, any – any time you have a story that – that kind of depicts what's going on is super helpful, like what it's going to be like for you when you are released, those things are really important to – for us because a lot of people don't know what that's like. So that kind of stuff, like, we always take it because it's just eye opening to what it's like to be incarcerated. So we love those kind of stories.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, yeah, I – I was [unintelligible] I was discussing this at the – the bible study table over here which they – they love my – my – me sitting in on now. [unintelligible] that, like, yeah, for most inmates, these stories are hard to come by. It's not something out on the streets you're going to be able to get – very easily get from the guys. They don't really talk about this stuff, so I can –</br></br>

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: - see that – the appeal there in getting it this way. And [crosstalk] –</br></br>

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: - you know, feel free to contact me if you ever want to when I get out of here. Number is [redacted]. I'd love to hear from any of you guys. It's always very special to me to – to talk to people.</br></br>

UCI: Well, thank –</br></br>

Caller: Yeah.</br></br>

UCI: Absolutely. Well, thank you so much and have a – have a good night.</br></br>

Caller: Okay. You, too. Thanks again. Bye.</br></br>

UCI: Bye.
