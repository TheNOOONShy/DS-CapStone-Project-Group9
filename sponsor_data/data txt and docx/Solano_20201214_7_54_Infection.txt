This story was told by a person incarcerated at Solano.</br></br>Caller: You know?</br></br>UCI: Mhm.</br></br>Caller: And then I just and I feel so dejected right now because I know that in the conditions that we’re in right now, that if an outside agency knew how we’re living right now in this particular moment, that they would be, uh, aghast. That they would, they would, you know, probably have this place shut down right now. You know?</br></br>
If they knew we were up in here freezing cold, water on the floor, no cleaning supplies, and not socially distanced, right now. We’re in a gym, for crying out loud, that leaks. The temperature in here right now is 60 degrees. Cause they got a thermometer on the wall.</br></br>UCI: I’m so sorry to hear that.</br></br>Caller: Yeah, and it, it’s so crowded up in here. Right now, there’s over, I would guesstimate it’s over a hundred and some people in here right now, that’s, um, that’s uh, uh, positive. Um, in fact, it started off, they sent us from our building.</br></br>
Our building has such a major outbreak, I was in building 16. They had such a major outbreak that they cleared the building once, about once, uh, fifteen of us got, got found with the COVID. They cleared the building to decontaminate it.</br></br>And, of course during that event, they end up, uh, the stuff end up jumping to where, uh, you know they’re quarantining, a bunch of other buildings. So, the outbreak is very, very bad here. It’s very, very, very, very bad.</br></br>And, uh, they don’t know what to do. And I’ve been moved twice. The first time from my building. The second time was when I became, when I became positive and moved me to the gym. And, you know, we have no, then they have no compassion for us. You know they have no compassion for us.</br></br>And, you know a lot of my coworkers and stuff. I have strong faith in God. You know? But a lot of my, um, fellow inmates, you know some of those guys are scared. You can see it in their eyes. You know they are absolutely, uh, terrified. You know?</br></br>And for the sergeant to come in here and the way she did this morning, and, uh, come in here and say the things she said, it’s that, that it, it’s, dejected us. You know? Truth is, this might be our last week alive.</br></br>And the women will sit back and have the nerve enough to tell us, we can’t put stuff on the top bunk? And we telling her we have rats and roaches up in here and we don’t want our food and stuff getting ate. And then she said, “Put it in your locker.” I said, “Sergeant, that locker only holds so much. It don’t hold a lot of my property.” You know? I have a lot to take.</br></br>UCI: Mhm.</br></br>Caller: You know? And just, I and, and that’s, that’s why I’m here right now. To try to reach out to somebody. I wish they could have somebody to come to this prison and see the conditions that they got us living in these gyms right now.
