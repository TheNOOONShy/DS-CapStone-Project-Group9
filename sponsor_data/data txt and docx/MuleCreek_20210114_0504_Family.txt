So you mentioned that you weren’t able to speak with your clinician, or?</br></br> Caller: Yeah.</br></br>UCI: So does that have like, the fact that you couldn’t speak with your clinician, does that affect your visitation hours or other inmates’ visitation hours? Has anybody at your facility been able to see loved ones or anyone since the pandemic started?</br></br> Caller: No. No, they said they got these video visits goin’ on, but now there’s a bunch of stipulations where you can’t go to video visits.

So me, I haven’t been able to see my loved ones in over a year now.</br></br> UCI: I see.</br></br>Caller: My grandma’s got real bad dementia so you know she’s goin’ through it, she’s really goin’ through it, so the only time I get to talk to her is on the phone.
UCI: Oh, I see.
