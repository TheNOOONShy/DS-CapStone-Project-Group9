This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Tehachapi.</br></br>

Their voices ease my mind and emotions, so with that I continue my daily routines here drama free. I don’t dwell on this sickness, that it can affect me, I’m conscious of the threat, but I don’t let it rule my life for the worst.</br></br>

I’m coping with the situation in the best way know how with what I am working with. I stick to my studies within to progress on change and write to my loved ones continuously. When I can’t talk to them, and their letters keep me going. I’m safe enough, it’s them I’m concerned for. What happens here is the least of my concern.
