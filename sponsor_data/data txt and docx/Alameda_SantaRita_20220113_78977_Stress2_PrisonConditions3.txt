This story was told by a person incarcerated at Santa Rita Jail.</br></br>

Caller: So the expert witness psychiatrist of the court, they’ll make them, they'll get them to conclude that you’re incompetent or whatever they want them to conclude. But when you get to the hospital, they’ll tell the psychiatrist up there to diagnose you with whatever they want to have you diagnosed with. And involuntarily medicate you.</br></br>

UCI: That’s not fair for you at all. It really isn’t. But I mean, what can you do about it?</br></br>

Caller: You got to have your own attorney. So, in other words, if you don’t pay for your justice, you’re not going to get justice. Even if you pay for it, you still might not get it.</br></br>

UCI: Wow. Well, I want to ask you another question just like in regards to the pandemic. Yeah, I want to know how you’ve been coping with like all this going on right now in the world.</br></br>

Caller: Oh my god. It's, I’ve been in here for a whole year, and they’re trying to have me sent to [redacted] right now to be involuntarily medicated when I’ve never been diagnosed with no mental illness. That makes no sense. But that’s not going to hide what they’ve done in the CLETS and the CRIMS.</br></br>

But yeah, I just wanted everybody to know that these court officials are the people that we have in the place of position to serve and protect the community; are the ones that are victimizing us.
