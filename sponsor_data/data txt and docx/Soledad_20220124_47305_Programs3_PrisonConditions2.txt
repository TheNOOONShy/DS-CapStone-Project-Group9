This story was told by a person incarcerated at Soledad.</br></br>

Caller: We had a couple of food sales. That's like a fundraiser thing where we can buy food from the street, like Jack in the Box or you know, we go through these companies and we pay exorbitant price.</br></br>

So like a cheeseburger would be $18. So, but people don't really care 'cause they want to eat real food. 'Cause we get a lot of soybean product some plant-based stuff, but it's not, it's not, it's not organic per se. It's not like shopping at Whole Foods.</br></br>

It's like shopping somewhere. We're limited on television because we don't have, we don't have the major networks other than ABC, NBC, CBS, PBS, but like, you know, the information age has changed.</br></br>

Most of the time when you're watching TV, you got 100 channels. We don't have that here. We're like one of the only institutions. We're in a dead area.</br></br>

So they're trying to get a better cable package for us. Let me think of what else is going on. They clean not to the level that they could. I honestly believe they should have 24 hour cleaning crews, 'cause I mean, this stuff is serious.</br></br>

There's really - well, by only being one building, there's a lot less, prison politics and a lot less fights because there's only one building on the yard now. So, you know, people is more worried about trying to get out of prison now than politic in it. So I think that's a good thing.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>

Caller: So we have, different programs. One of our programs, and you guys might want to check into it, was we had this, thing where we had Lisa Lang come in here and, she filmed this guy's story 'cause he got out. But they had like a prison academy, like a leadership academy.</br></br>

So those are some of the silver lining points, but it's like every time they try to do something great, like have a podcast or something like that, they either don't get full support, or something interrupts it, like either staff quits or something like that. It's always like, it's hard to believe that this is a 14 billion corporation and there's always hiccups, and I mean like major hiccups.
