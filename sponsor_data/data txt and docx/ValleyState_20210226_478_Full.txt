This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Valley State.</br></br>

PrisonPandemic,</br></br>

A friend of mine gave me a letter which invited inmates to share their experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic. I would like to share the following, and I understand it could be publicly posted anonymously.</br></br>

I have been incarcerated for more than 17 years with a 26-to-life sentence for murder. Otherwise, I had no record. I have been at Valley State Prison since it was converted to a men's prison in 2012.</br></br>

We inmates pay attention to the news, and we knew the pandemic would affect us although we did not know how. We remain vulnerable to overcrowding between 100 percent to 200 percent of design capacity, which, in turn, makes us extremely vulnerable to disease transmission.</br></br>

Early in 2020, the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitations or CDCR reduced program dramatically in effort to reduce the spread of COVID-19. We, except for few critical workers, were no longer allowed to go to work, attend school, or attend self-help groups.</br></br>

Our time for recreation on the yard became reduced to two hours per day so that only one building would be on the yard at a time. The CDCR reduced our access to dayrooms to two hours per day so that only one of four hallways would be in the dayroom at a time.</br></br>

These changes reduced our ability to use telephones, and all visiting was cancelled. This caused our ability to contact family and friends to decrease greatly.</br></br>

The CDCR took other measures to help in these areas. They worked with our telephone monopoly, GTL, to give us two days per month of free phone calls. They gave all of us without recent write ups a credit of 84 days off of our sentences.</br></br>

Eventually, they allowed short video visits. Unfortunately, telephone access was reduced to half for social distancing, which made it very hard to sign up for a phone call.</br></br>

Time dragged on as it usually does for prisoners except even more slowly. Reduced programming in prison and increased isolation is damaging to inmates unless they can find a way to protect their psychological and emotional systems.</br></br>

To protect myself, I needed to stay busy being productive, so I started studying Hebrew and Spanish. I had in my possession a college textbook for learning how to read Hebrew, and later, I borrowed a Spanish book from the 'Dummies' series from a friend of mine.</br></br>

I started with Hebrew and skimmed the book once and then started over methodically with a will and an overflow of time in my life to study. I studied for a few hours each day, sometimes as little as two and sometimes six or more.</br></br>

After several months of study, I can read the Old Testament in Hebrew, and I know about 85 to 90 percent of all Old Testament Hebrew roots. Speaking the language would be a different story since I've never heard a conversation in Hebrew, but reading it has been a breakthrough to me.</br></br>

I've been around Spanish speakers for much of my life, so I know a few words and phrases, but I started studying the Spanish for Dummies book, and I do recommend it. I recently started writing friends of mine in Mexico in Spanish! I'm starting to practice oral skills too.</br></br>

Meanwhile, I noticed some things about how the pandemic has been handled in prison. First, many staff members refused to wear masks for months. Inmates didn't want to in many cases, but we were ordered to long before the officers were ordered to.</br></br>

Next, when people were exposed to the virus, they were all moved to another building. I noticed that as they gathered on their original yard to await escort to the quarantine building, officers took all their IDs and put them together in one plastic bag. This procedure had never been done before.</br></br>

When they got to the quarantine building, their IDs were redistributed. I kept wondering why, since many of them did not have the virus, why would they put all their IDs in one bag? It was a foolish thing to do if you did not want the virus to spread.</br></br>

Eventually, I tested positive for the virus. So I was not moved to the same building as 'exposed' people. I went to a building for only people who tested positive. What I learned was this: To get out of that quarantined building (with no program all locked down), a person needed to report no symptoms for two weeks.</br></br>

I hate to say this, but many prisoners are not completely honest. What did they do? Of course they did not want to stay locked in a room for 24 hours a day, so regardless of how they felt, they reported twice each day that they had no fever, they were released from quarantine after two weeks to freely infect others.</br></br>

This was done with the knowledge of the federal medical receiver assigned to oversee California's prisons. For some reason, instead of requiring a negative test to get out of quarantine, the receiver OK'd the word of each prisoner to self report symptoms other than vitals taken by nurses.</br></br>

So they dumped still-sick inmates back into the population. That's how I got the virus. A person in 'so-called' remission was placed in my room. Was all that intentional? I don't know. Was it negligent? Yes.</br></br>

Beyond that, most people don't know that one of the most stressful things you can do to an inmate is move him to another cell, room, building, yard or prison. He won't feel safe while he's being moved. He doesn't know if danger awaits him in the next room he moves to. It's very hard and stressful.</br></br>

Overcrowding makes us vulnerable to disease. While the CDCR may report that Valley State Prison is at some lesser percentage, most buildings and rooms are at 175 to 200 percent of design capacity. How can they report a lower number?</br></br>

Because they count rooms and buildings they should not. For example, the 'hole' on ad seg building represents 100 cells that are not normal housing. That shouldn't count as open cells. Another entire building of 32 rooms with eight beds each is reserved for sick people.</br></br>

These rooms should not be counted as capacity. My room, as most others, contains eight people but was designed for four! It's a breeding ground for disease.</br></br>

The problem is that the federal judges allows the CDCR to be at 137.5 percent of design capacity overall. That counts ad seg or punishment isolation, or administrative segregation, condemned areas, quarantine areas, etc.</br></br>

During the time with the most cases here, inmates were housed in the gymnasium, chapels, and classrooms with porta-potties and cold portable showers! These were inmates with COVID-19!</br></br>

To be ready for a pandemic, every prison throughout the state should be capped at 90 percent design capacity, and that capacity should never include ad seg, condemned areas or non-standard housing. Then the state would have the ability to move people around if needed and to create quarantine areas.</br></br>

Until that happens, we cannot be kept safe regardless of how hard the wardens and staff work. They have been given an impossible situation to deal with. I've survived COVID-19, but others did not.
