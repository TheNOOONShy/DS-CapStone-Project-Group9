This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Chino.</br></br>

Anywho for this to be an institution constituted by the state of California, it was very well lacking in protocol when the pandemic hit. Granted it was totally unexpected, so everyone had to get acclimated. I can say this, and I speak in earnestly, and truth.</br></br> 

As for Central Institution for Men, we’ve never been six feet away apart as far as our living conditions. Currently we have a mask but, this is something we had to fight for in the beginning. Because we are inmates naturally people tend to treat you like you’re not a full-on citizen.</br></br> 

Now not every staff member feels like this but. You do have individuals who like to remind you that they could care less. Like much of the general populace we were ignorant to the nature and facts of COVID-19. It was truly a sight to see on the news every day as the death toll rose.</br></br> 

We were all so worried about our family members not being able to physically be there was a very big challenge to most of us. A lot of skeptics said the government unleashed the virus, or that it was a form of population control. Me I knew this was something that would be here for a while.
