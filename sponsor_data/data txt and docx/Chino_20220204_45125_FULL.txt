This story was told by a person incarcerated at Chino.</br></br>

UCI: What has the COVID situation been like at your facility?</br></br>

Caller: Oh okay, well the COVID situation has been like here, we've been on a quarantine status. It goes and it comes, it's been coming in waves it seems. Now the particular facility that we're at, we have its approximately 155 men in one dorm and then directly across from us there’s two other dorms that house approximately the same amount of bodies.</br></br>

So, from my understanding it's been about the full, all three to full capacity. So, what I meant in the beginning of the conversation when COVID-19, as far as any the spreading or being identified as having COVID, began across the way from us. Right across, probably within, I don't know I want to say, about 100 feet. So that building became quarantined right around those, say about like, in the beginning of December I’d say.</br></br>

And there was like no movement as far as any, you know, any of the - the programming. As far as being able to, you know, for those guys to be able to get out and go on the yard, and have regular programming. So, they got quarantined for the building and 14 days at that. So, what happens with those cases of COVID kept, you know, kept coming and more people kept getting it.</br></br> 

And next thing you know the unit next to magnolia had - they had got some cases in their dorm. And then initially into our dorm so we were the last dorm to get it. So, all of us have been affected by the COVID-19, the spread of it anyways.</br></br> 

And they they’ve really been doing a good job, the medical staff here as far as best to my knowledge. And I'm nowhere near a doctor but it seems like they have really been on top of - of a, you know, testing, coming in on the swabs. And, you know, and pretty much as far as they're, you know, looks to me as if they’re doing it in a professional manner as far as medical goes.</br></br>  

You know, they’re all geared up and see all their, you know, they got the mask, the shield, they're all gloved up in all their gowns and everything. So, but the thing is, the real bummer for it, you know, is, you know, of course the quarantine. Even the bigger picture of the thing is not about being quarantined, you know?</br></br>

Most of it is your understanding nobody wants to catch this thing. And the idea is to really just kind of to round it up and corral it, sort of speak, corral it up and and not let it move you know. Take the body of people and corral them up and then keep them there for a minute.</br></br>  

But, so that’s been an enduring, mundane thing to have to readjust not being able to go outside, not being able to, you know, to not even walk to go get your medication. Now that comes to us. So, and it just seems like the endless thing, of how long can this go on. We would quarantine, and then from quarantine if it advances still and there’s more people continuing to get it.</br></br>  

As they continue to come in and test, which it has been more people have tested positive, so they put the building in isolation. Which means you can’t, absolutely, you know, you can’t walk to go get your your pill line or anything like that. So, it’s really kind of shaken up, as far as you go from having a program, you know, and having outside - your outside recreation facilities. Being able to workout and exercise and, you know, fresh air and all that to being enclosed.</br></br>   

It’s kind of been a rough thing you know. The odd thing though is that I‘ve been here in this dorm, this dorm got quarantined on December the 30th, of 2021 and today’s date is February 4th. We’re still actually quarantined with partial programming, so it’s slowly now coming back.</br></br>   

But we’ve been on quarantine past the initial 14 days quarantine and then they reissued another one. But the strange thing of it is, one of the strange things it said while this all took off while it was just seemed, like, it was all in a blaze. The first - the first tube to test like in the early beginning stages when they tested and swab. It seemed like the first one came through, and okay - yeah that’s a positive.</br></br>  

But that second batch of people that tested now all of a sudden all these people all, you know, more than maybe 50 percent of the second people that swabbed have tested positive for the virus. Now here’s the odd thing that I’m getting to is that nobody, and I mean, I’ve talked to a few people in here, it’s like, have you seen anybody in here who’s experienced those symptoms?</br></br> 

'Cause they always ask you, you know, "How are you feeling today are you experiencing any COVID flu-like symptoms, any COVID symptoms?" None, none, zero, some guys have a sniffly nose but there - there was no fever, there was no signs at all. No nothing, no symptoms and it seemed like a couple of people had coughs, you know, but it was nothing, yeah, just like a normal, you'd call it kennel cough or something.</br></br> 

But in other words I hope I’m not over talking too much.</br></br>  

UCI: No. No, you’re good man.</br></br>  

Caller: Oh, okay. So, I guess that’s really my take on it and it’s just been my experience through this whole thing within the last five weeks now, I think.</br></br> 

UCI: Gotcha. Okay and I don’t think I recall you hearing anything about, like, the vaccine situation. What has that been like at your facility?</br></br> 

Caller: Yes. Are you there?</br></br> 

UCI: Yeah. Hello?</br></br> 

Caller: Yeah. Tell me one more time. You wanted - tell me one more time about the vaccination.</br></br>  
 
UCI: So, like, I don’t think I heard you say anything about the vaccines from what you were telling me. So, how has the vaccination situation at your facility been like?</br></br> 

Caller: Right. Got it. Well, I personally had my vaccine while I was in the LA county jail system. But then once I mainlined to here, came to Chino, I already had my shot. But they have offered it. They have been giving the vaccination out to different various people that actually would want it. I think it's still on a voluntary basis.</br></br> 

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br> 

Caller: You know. So, but yeah, and then one guy in particular he had his COVID or CDC, you know, the card that verifies you’ve been vaccinated and all that.</br></br> 

UCI: Yeah.</br></br> 

Caller: So, but yeah, yeah.</br></br> 

UCI: Gotcha. Okay. And so what about the - how has COVID - how’s the COVID situation in your facility affected your your loved ones? Like such as your family, or anyone or any incarcerated individuals that, you know, are your friends or maybe your family in there too. So like what about that?</br></br> 

Caller: Right.</br></br> 

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br> 

Caller: Right. Yeah, you know, of course there is concern, there is concern on health issues. You know, for me personally, mine of course goes out to my girl, my girlfriend. She has asthma. she’s had bronchial issues, you know. She’s a frequent cigarette smoker.</br></br> 

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br> 

Caller: So, you know - but it concerns me, you know? I’ve been able to - one of the benefits about being incarcerated for the past eight months is I’ve been able to quit smoking, you know, cigarettes, you know. So, but that concerns me, as far as my thing with her. Because I mean, it's like, it has a - mainly the attack goes on primarily on the bronchial right, if I’m not mistaken.</br></br> 
 
UCI: Mm-hmm. Yeah.</br></br> 

Caller: So, but yeah. I hope that answers your question.</br></br> 

UCI: Yeah - yeah, it did of course. And to go back to another question, you know, what has it - you mentioned your girlfriend, has she been able to visit you, and has she been able to visit you? What has it been like for reduced visitation?</br></br> 

Caller: No. Oh no. 'Cause I think the visitation had been - had been been, that program had been modified as well. So, there was no visitation available because of the quarantine. My understanding is that the entire prison was pretty much quarantined and then eventually isolated and all.</br></br> 

So yeah it’s been a pretty big to-do over here.</br></br> 

UCI: Yeah, yeah, and then any last thoughts before the line calls - the line cuts?</br></br> 

Caller: You know, I think what you guys are doing there at UC Irvine is a great outlet to have this available to reach out to us and we can, you know, reach back at you. You know, to let you know what’s happening on a health end of the safety and concerns for the inmates. We appreciate it.</br></br> 

UCI: Hey, no problem man. Tell your friends about us we’re open from Monday.
