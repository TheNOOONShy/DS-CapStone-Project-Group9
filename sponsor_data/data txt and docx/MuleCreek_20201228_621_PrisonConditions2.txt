This story was told by a person incarcerated at Mule Creek.</br></br>

Caller: They tested me on a Thursday, and they didn't take me until three or four days later. So, I was like spreading it. Finally, when they started moving people, they took you out of your cells, told you to leave all your personal property in your cell, and then they'll move you away to another yard, A yard, B yard.</br></br>

And they're still doing it. They're moving people everywhere. And your personal property was just left there, and they have some other inmate come pack your stuff. So, now people have got property missing. Fortunately, I took all of my property with me. But I've seen it. I've seen people that are missing stuff.</br></br>

It's 66 people in each pod. Nobody's in there, just their personal property, because they moved them all. They put them on level four because they have a building down there for quarantine, instead of just locking us in the cell. It was freezing cold in that damn gym. I'm talking about just it's crazy. And they've got this shower that it looks like a trailer, and you only can use it every three days. The hot water runs out because there's so many people. So, you've got to go outside in the cold to take a cold shower.</br></br>

UCI: Wow.
