This story was told by a person incarcerated at New Folsom.</br></br>UCI: And what has the COVID situation been like at your facility?</br></br>Caller: Yeah. It's been people catching it on and off, but see the problems that we have in here, they trying to say that my celly had it, and my celly, he tested negative for it. We got our results and they still put us, slammed us down for a month. We ain't have programs from April 14th, since April 14th.</br></br>UCI: Wow, so since people have been getting vaccinated, have they been offering the vaccine to you guys?</br></br>Caller: Yes, they offered and we already got both vaccines but that still ain't doing nothing. They still slamming us down. Like I said, this is our first day off, today. Now we got a little yard in a month.</br></br>UCI: So, before they slammed you guys down, how was the visitation and program going on?</br></br>Caller: It ain't no visitation - oh, they just started visitation. It was, it just started behind the glass but before that, man it was nothing. We didn't have groups 'cause we have mental health groups or we have self-help groups to help us go home early, they stopped all of it.</br></br>I mean they slammed us all the way down where we couldn't have no type of program. And we were just in the cell 24/7. They was hardly even giving us showers.</br></br>For the first couple weeks, they wasn't even giving us showers because they tried to blame, "Oh man we don't know what's going on. Oh, we don't know."
