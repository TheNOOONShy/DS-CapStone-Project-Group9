Attention: UCI Pandemic</br></br>
I received your concern letter on what is now our V-Day, the vaccination day for the virus. God bless us all.</br></br>
This COVID-19 2020 pandemic has been a nightmare. I lost an uncle and aunt. I was unable to tell them how I changed my life around since being in prison, rehabilitating, which you really want, and to stay safe in prison. You must follow guidelines and instructions - some do not - and it makes it even harder to stay safe from COVID-19.</br></br> 
I was thankful at the beginning virus on how to stay safe and prevent by washing hands, six feet apart, disinfecting and wearing mask. Some people really don’t care until it hit them. But I know it's real because love ones are still hurt behind lost and concern about my incarceration. I was sentenced 18 years. I have liver cirrhosis and I am scared. And I do care about others and would love to take care of the elderly, like my mom.</br></br>

So far my health has been good at this particular moment. The unit I'm housed in had a major breakout because they were not taking it seriously. Yes! This prison gives us mask, disinfect, there’s signs all around about how to stay safe. There is free co-pay to see a nurse if you have an issue. But some people learn the hard way.</br></br> 
I will be 56 years of age, and pray I make many more.</br></br>
Before this unit was on total lockdown, I would get exercise go to. My assign job is in a big building, an academic education area, so I see a lot of people when on normal schedule, but since the pandemic, all has been modified. Good.</br></br>
I pray I can stay safe and out of evil's way and follow all rules to prevent COVID-19.</br></br> 
I really appreciate your concern and would enjoy having more support. Tt helps during this pandemic. </br></br>
In holy Bible, Psalm 37:3</br></br>
Trust in the Lord and do good. Dwell in the land and befriend faithfulness. Amen.</br></br>
Psalm 91:10</br></br>
No evil shall be allowed to befall you. No plague come near your tent. Amen.</br></br>
Yes! I miss my family dearly and hope to come home soon healthy.</br></br>                                                                                                                   Regards.</br></br>Wash hands.</br></br>Thank you all.</br></br>
P.S. The reason why also because of so much breakout inadequate testing. I think it should be more with inmates.</br></br>Happy holidays, Hanukah, Christmas, Kwanza and many more safe New Years!
