UCI: And how has the COVID situation been like there?</br></br>

Caller: Oh, I haven't seen anybody giving any shots. We don't have to wear masks. I'm in the seriously mental ill department. I was told today they might transfer me to a-</br></br>

But I've been threatened and beat up five times in the last week, and I've got serious broken bones and injuries. I've lost the retina in my right eye, and can't see out of my right eye. When I asked to see medical today, they sent a psychiatrist to talk to me. Just a while ago, they moved a bunch of people out and a bunch of new people in.</br></br>

I feel like my life has been threatened. And I want to say that the Free Masons have taken over this jail facility and the sheriff of - County Sheriff's Department as well as the Sheriff's Department, and I believe that people are being murdered by the Free Masons to remove them and keep them quiet. I feel that my life is in grave danger today.</br></br>

I'm supposed to go to court tomorrow, but I haven't had a pass key to call on the phone or use the kiosk since last Wednesday or Thursday. I was beaten up and tried to report that. Because I tried to report it, my life became in danger.</br></br> 

Each of the interviews they're handling is at the front gate here where other people can hear, and that gossip has spread through the - through the pen that I'm in. I'm in - And they moved a couple guys out today who were threatening my life as they went out, and they were spreading gossip to other people, so I may be beaten up again if I'm not yanked up and moved to a single pod.</br></br>

I'm not sure if they're going to or not. But I wanted to call after 5:00 here and get that recorded because I feel like my life is in grave danger. I - I want to emphasize that the Free Masons have taken over the sheriff's department.</br></br>

The police chief was in the newspaper several days ago, I think Saturday or Sunday, and he's been indicted for being at Washington, D.C. on January. And this is the situation that we have at Washington, D.C., and our police departments around the world and the people that were going to represent President Trump cause he's too rich. He can't be buy - bought by the Free Masons.</br></br> 

So, those that aren't are safe, but those that can be bought are at jeopardy. And I refuse to join the Free Masons. And because of that, I have been continually arrested and jailed every other year since 1999, when I refused to join them. Do you have more questions?</br></br>

UCI: With everything that has been going on, how have you been coping?</br></br>

Caller: Well, I'm trying to stay alive from all the beatings that I've had. I've had serious beatings. I've had five men try to kill me at one time, back on September, and I was only transferred next door.</br></br>

Whereas the rumors came through, a note on the door that I had been in this fight, and then I had a problem in that spot. It sounded like all the problems moved out today, so I'm not sure if they just moved those people to scare me or something or what's going on.</br></br>

Psychiatry told me they were gonna move me to a two-man pod today for my own safety. Right now, I am terrified of the people that are sitting around me, five or six people that are all terrified, and I'm scared to death that there is a situation that is been unhandled here because of - I asked for medical, and they asked me, "Who beat you up?" and I had to tell them.</br></br>

I have to go to lunch now at dinnertime. So, that's all I have. Thank you.</br></br>

UCI: All right. Thank you for sharing.</br></br>

Caller: Thank you. Pray for me, please.</br></br>

UCI: Of course. Thank you for your time.
