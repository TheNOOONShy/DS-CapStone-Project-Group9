COVID-19 notes</br></br>

August 10, 2020: All PA workers were sent to back to wings. Workers were informed by custody that only G-wing would be going to work. Once in wing, we were informed that showers would run one cell at a time per their own tier.</br></br>

That our wing would be placed on a two-week quarantine. No movement in or out of wing. Furthermore, we were told that all essential critical workers would be placed in G-wing during this two weeks. At the moment, there’s no infected inmates in F, G, or X-wing. Nor Z-wing.</br></br>

There’s no reasonable sense in placing all critical workers in one wing. There’d be too many workers coming back from work at the same time. There’d be no way to keep any social distance within such a crowded space. It’s more of a risk to my personal health than remaining in E-wings quarantine.</br></br>

August 17, 2020: There have been reportedly eight to 11 more confirmed positive tested inmates in CTF Central as of today. They, CTF Central, have been running yard for the infected wings B, C, D. Why are these wings allowed to yard if there’s known confirmed cases in there?</br></br>

Also, along with G, F-wing is now going to work. If it’s not safe for soc or education classes to run, why is PIA still up and running? Is the value of a dollar that a PIA makes more important than the life of a family’s loved one working there? Rather it be staff or inmate.</br></br>

August 21, 2020: Black inmate dies today in D-wing. At this moment I haven’t heard from what. This cellmate is still in the same cell.</br></br>

August 26, 2020: Inmate tests positive in Echo-wing. Sent to Y-wing. Me and my celly were tested today. Temperature - 98.5 degrees.</br></br>

August 31, 2020: 97.3 degrees and 97.1 degrees.</br></br>
