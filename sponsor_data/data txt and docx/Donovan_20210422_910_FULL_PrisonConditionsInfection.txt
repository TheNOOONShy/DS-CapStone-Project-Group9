Hello PrisonPandemic,</br></br>

Well, let me first thank you for taking the time to reach out to me, I appreciate the interest. There's no harm in attempting to reach out and inquire about life in prison to those you don't know; however for inmates like myself it's nice to hear from the outside.</br></br>

Now, you wanted to know how it has been for me during this pandemic, well lets say it's interesting and scary. Unfortunately, I've been incarcerated for the last 25 years, so for the last 10 years I no longer stay in contact with my family so I'm by myself; which I'm comfortable being alone so I have no concern about family during COVID-19.</br></br>

However, since I've started doing time my number one rule that I was taught is "safety first," so by all means I will protect myself especially from being sick. More so because I have high blood pressure and a pacemaker and by me catching COVID could and can make it very, very difficult for me.</br></br>

So, CDCR has in my opinion a decent and thorough safety measure; however those that do come into COVID symptoms don't take heed to the seriousness of being safe. Now, it's been a big number of cases here at Donovan; however at this moment I'm writing you it's been told that nine custody officers have been infected with COVID symptoms.</br></br>

Basically, when prisoner  get infected with coronavirus, it comes from state workers, such as medical staff, custody officers, mental health staff, etc etc.</br></br>

There's no possible way us prisoners can catch COVID-19 especially when we always locked up. Donovan do provide a quarantine building where inmates that may have been at outside clinics, hospitals, or somewhat symptoms do 14 days quarantine until medical feels no further need for quarantine.</br></br>

Furthermore, those that do have COVID symptoms and has been infected are isolated and removed from population and critical safety measures are placed to keep the spread of the virus. Which may not be easy due to inmates being embarrassed or just not considerate in saying "I feel sick," which is common in prison.</br></br>

And then custody, hell, they don't follow the rules even though they enforce the rules. It seem like a case of population control but like I mentioned, if those like myself follow safety measures by wearing the proper PPE (protective personal equipment) and wash hands frequency and sanitize we're all good.</br></br>

Now, as far as the vaccinations every prisoner and state worker are subject to being vaccinated based on options and not all here has been vaccinated for their own reasons. But I myself has been vaccinated by Pfizer twice. I even have my COVID card.</br></br>

So, this pandemic in prison is based on how each prisoner proceeds whether good, ugly, or the bad. And this is my opinion and assessment during this pandemic.</br></br>

Sincerely.
