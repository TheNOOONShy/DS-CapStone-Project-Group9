UCI: Okay, so, you can share any information related to either facilities that you've been at if you would like. So, I guess if you can explain the COVID situation at your original facility if you'd like.</br></br>

Caller: It's, like, 23 hour lockdown. We'd get out, like, once, twice a day sometimes. Near the end it's like they'd give us day room, like, two, three times a day sometimes. I mean, like, we'd get, like, an hour out and then, like, top tier, bottom tier. Like, during the COVID situation it's actually like they do room for room.</br></br> 

So, it's like one room would be out for 45 minutes and then they'd put us both down, and then the next room would be out for 45 minutes. And they'd do that three times a day just like regular-just like cereal and stuff for breakfast, and then one hot tray which is usually not that good, and then, like, peanut butter and some, like, really nasty, gross diabetic jelly for dinner or, like, baloney sandwiches, like, this weird package.</br></br>

UCI: Okay.</br></br>

Caller: It's, like, they wouldn't really answer any questions too much. Like, guards are kind of dicks.</br></br>

UCI: So, they were dodging your questions? Did you say that?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, yeah, we had to fill out a kite for anything. And every time we filled out a kite we had to do it, like, seven or eight times before they'd finally get back to us, like, a week later.
