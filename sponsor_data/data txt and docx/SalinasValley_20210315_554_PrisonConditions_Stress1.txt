This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Salinas Valley.</br></br>

But imma be totally honest, there is so much drugs here it’s insane. It’s like the streets- wax, meth, heroine, weed, mainly. There's how some of us cope with the stress. I would be home next year sometime but seems so far out. There’s barely any programs right now but I wanna get my GED, learn a few things for re-entry cuz this is one place I don’t wanna ever come back to prison.</br></br> 

With COVID having everything shut down, we have no access to library or anything. We would be able to access everything is to be requested through paper via mail. As for me, I’m barely getting by. Tensions are high and I don’t want to piss off the wrong person. I wish they would make a reform or change something to where I can go home faster. My dad is 66, and I’m afraid he’ll catch this nasty virus.</br></br>

Everyday I pray for a miracle, well today I got your letter- that’s a start. I really hope I hear back from PrisonPandemic soon. I almost forgot I got assaulted by Wasco correctional officers for trying to get basic things so I’m scared that I can’t go to CO and ask a question. But PrisonPandemic, it’s cool you picked me to write.</br></br> 

It’s rare I get picked for anything but to be a part of a history of prison and world pandemic, I'm all in. Some days are harder than others, I’ve seen two deaths and one suicide. There’s one guy that just took out who later died at the hospital. I hope this letter finds you in good health 'till next time. I’m hopeful you can write back.</br></br> 

PS. It’s crazy to see face masks in prison, dirty syringes 10 to 15 guys share. And man the list goes on.
