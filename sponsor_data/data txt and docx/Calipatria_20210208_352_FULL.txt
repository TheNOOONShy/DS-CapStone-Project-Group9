This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Calipatria.</br></br>February 7th, 2021</br></br>Hey PrisonPandemic, how are you? So I just received your letter and thank you for the kind and inspirational words. I felt the energy behind them.</br></br>I am curious to know how did you get my name? I asked a few people around here if they received letters from the PrisonPandemic project and it seems that I’m the only one and I can’t recall ever writing your organization. I’m just curious to know how your organization got my name...</br></br>Now as far as the PrisonPandemic project goes here at the prison I’m in, they basically shut down the whole prison. We only come out of our cells every other day for showers and phone calls now.</br></br>I don’t know about how everybody else is holding up in their box/cell, but me, I’m working on bettering myself for the future and staying productive by being creative. My creative hobbies are writing poetry, music & film. It’s how I leave this place mentally.</br></br>I hope I don’t come across as thirsty but I got to ask if it would be possible for me and you to build a line of communication. I only ask because I don’t have nobody writing me and it would be nice to have somebody to talk to who is not in prison with me.</br></br>And you seem like you possess and project a lot of positive energy and I can use some of that energy in my life. Plus, you never know something good may can come out of us getting to know each other. I don’t know how far your organization goes when dealing with people in prison, but I have my own personal story that I would like to share with the world.</br></br>Yours truly.
