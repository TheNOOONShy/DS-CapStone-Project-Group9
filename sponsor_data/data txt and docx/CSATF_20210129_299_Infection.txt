Officers started coming up missing in action, testing positive. I made it past Thanksgiving which was a herculean defeat but finally tested positive on December 9th and moved to quarantine. By then over 1,500 of the 8,400 of us at the prison had tested positive and eight had died.</br></br>

My symptoms were minimal, no smell, no taste, a sore throat. I lost 11 pounds which was fine with me. I was recently released from quarantine on January 9th, a full 30 days later. After having my vitals checked twice a day and given OTC medication for my sore throat.
