This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Donovan.</br></br>May 14, 2021</br></br>Dear, to whom it may concern, I really do have so much to tell you, not enough paper to explain all. It will really benefit the two sides if it were possible to receive a one on one interview. Making a request for an interview with someone from your side.</br></br>My name is -----. At the age of 80 years old I was diagnosed with a mental disability and I am certified with the SSI department. I have suffered from mental illness my entire life up until now. And still do.So when the pandemic became the pandemic. I really tripped hard and began having very bad mental thinking of all different things in my mind. </br></br>I was taken to the hospital from an episode and was seeing all the COS that were not being quarantined and were interacting along with other COS. I was see that them being allowed to not quarantine and were interacting along with other COS. I was seeing that and them being allowed to not quarantine the eorpenrte people we’re not really having them to be checked out. That began to be spared throughout the system. The COS running to and from hospitals. </br></br> There are also the therapist here which are studying to get their credits for their internships to be doctors and psychiatrist, using us as experimentations and or guinea pigs and not really taking this seriously, being able to treat our mental illnesses, this has led to numerous problems.</br></br> Those training those in this is the wrong ways with no experiences or real education and able to treat the patients from real doctors that are professionals and qualified to work with mental patients because they don’t have to have the certification or experiences to work with mental patients and very numerous problems arise from this. </br></br>And the COS not even being trained to work with the mental patients. Been using excessive force, with pepper spray, batons and rifles, shooting mental patients because they do not know what the differences there in between numerous breakdowns and psychiatric problems. Nor do they know how to handle such issues and then causing problematic and legal way. Causing Extreme chaos and and sometimes even death, to them mentally ill. </br></br>They had me sedated and on very heavy medication for over six months. I could not think or focus for this period of time. And I now have more increased behavior problems and problems concentrating. I snap so very easily, getting into trouble Afton and having many problems down there in time I need to file any form of legal support they have medicated sedating by the mental health, the CDCRdoes not have the qualified or educated workers who know how to do qualifications needed.</br></br>My mental illnesses has not or cannot be treated by professionals on this facility because interns have training and school credits. No professional qualified therapist, doctor or a medication psychiatrist. It is so very deeper to even explain I’m really wanting for somebody to hear my story, I have a lot of more difficult situations even on the streets too and I am not being treated properly, or diagnosed accordingly from differently as the doctors have diagnosed me from age 8.
