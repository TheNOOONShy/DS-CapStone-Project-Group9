This story was told by a family member of someone incarcerated at Solano.</br></br>

UCI: Perfect. Okay, so what has their experience been like, and then what has your experience been like as a, you know, a loved one?</br></br>

Caller: Well, the experience for myself has been difficult because we have not been able to see them at all for a year. And they just recently started video visiting there, so it's only been in the last couple months they've had video visiting. So we haven't had any contact other than phone calls and letters with our loved ones.</br></br>

UCI: Mmhmm.</br></br>

Caller: And then on their behalf, I believe they are mishandling how they’re the, the process of how to quarantine somebody during the COVID, it seems to escape them at times. I am not sure if they've perfected it or not, but I do have a recording of my fiancé that he had called me, and I had recorded different people at different times mishandling the way the pandemic broke out there.</br></br>

UCI: Oh wow.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, I have a recording. If you have an email, I can send that to you, and you can have that to go with it.</br></br>

UCI: Oh. You know what? That's a great. Let me ask my supervisor real quick.</br></br>

Caller: Okay.</br></br>

UCI: In the meantime, can you explain kind of what it was like with writing letters, were you? Did you feel like taking longer than normal because of the pandemic? Did you feel like he was constantly being shuffled around or anything like that?</br></br>

Caller: He wasn’t constantly being shuffled around until recently, soon as they had an outbreak there. Which was like six months ago, and I’m guessing the time. I'm not positive the exact frame of time that it took place.</br></br> 

But as soon as it broke out, they would get an infected person in that building, and then they would quarantine that person and then they would quarantine the other people that weren't infected in another building. But then they were allowing still people to go to work even though they were around this person that was known to be infected.</br></br>

UCI: Mmhmm. Wow, so it was just, he, you really didn't know if one day you would get a letter and he would be infected, right?</br></br>

Caller: Right, yeah, because of how they mishandled the whole cha cha.</br></br> 

UCI: Yeah, absolutely. So I don't have a direct email, but I think what you can do if you'd like. We actually have our website open, it's up and running, and I can give you the URL, and you can actually write and email address and email that way. And then someone can get into contact with you.</br></br>

Caller: Okay.</br></br>

UCI: Is that okay?</br></br>

Caller: That is awesome. Okay, if you could give me that.</br></br>

UCI: Okay, whenever you're ready.</br></br>

Caller: I'm ready.</br></br>

UCI: Okay, so it's PrisonPandemic, and then its dot UCI dot edu.</br></br>

Caller: Dot, what was that after, p, Prison pandemic.</br></br> 

UCI: Oh. Sorry yeah, dot UCI.</br></br>

Caller: Okay.</br></br>

UCI: Dot edu.</br></br>

Caller: Edu.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, and then when you go to our website, at the very bottom, like on most websites, there's like a contact us, and you just put in your name, email address, and then your message and say hey, I have this recording and someone will be in contact with you if they are interested in it. That's incredible. Thanks for offering that.</br></br>

Caller: Okay, there was one other thing that really bothered me about how they handled it-</br></br>

UCI: Absolutely.</br></br>

Caller: Was one of their employees had come down with the COVID, and he was still going to work, and they allowed it.</br></br>

UCI: Oh wow, did they test the individual at all? Or did they not test?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, he had tested positive they called his work and told them that he tested positive, and they still let him go to work.</br></br>

UCI: Oh, and how did you, all you know, feel about that? was it across all employees they were doing this? Or was it just one?</br></br>

Caller: Not that we're aware of. As far as we’re aware of, it was only the one employee. But that's all that we’re aware of, but I'm saying if it happened to one employee and they found out about it, it's probably happened to more than one.</br></br>

UCI: Absolutely, and did you as somebody who, you know, has a loved one inside a facility, do you feel that you know the vaccination process is going okay? What are you able to gather from your fiancé?</br></br>

Caller: I think that the vaccination process is being handled a lot better than the pandemic was.</br></br>

UCI: Oh, okay. Can you explain a little bit?</br></br>

Caller: Well, they've already taken my fiancé, and he's already had both vaccinations, both shots, so even though he's never, because he's never had it, I'm assuming because he's never had it, he's one of the few there that's never had it, he got a shot. And that he's older and he has health risks.</br></br>

UCI: He did. When do you think that he was given the first dose, generally?</br></br>

Caller: I want to say, a month ago.</br></br>

UCI: Oh wow, okay, so sometime in February, that's great.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah.</br></br>

UCI: And then he got his second one pretty recently, then?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, it was just in the last week, a week and a half. Yeah, somewhere around there.</br></br>

UCI: That's great. I mean, that's amazing. Do you find, does he mention if, you know, a lot of, if there's some hesitancy with his peers, or do you see a lot of individuals also getting vaccinated?</br></br>

Caller: He didn't mention anybody else getting, being afraid of it. He did say that he got the chills and that, that was it. He got the body aches and the chills the second, during the second shot, and that they explained that to him that was gonna happen.</br></br>

UCI: Great. I mean, that's wonderful, and how have you been able then to cope with it? Have you seen a difference with yourself from the beginning to now?</br></br>

Caller: I think that at first, I was a little naive about the whole situation, but the pandemic broke out in the prison, and I saw how fast it had spread in there. It kinda made me a little gun shy on going out in public, and its affected me.</br></br>

UCI: And if there's anything that you want individuals to take away from what you've experienced, what would that be?</br></br>

Caller: That they need to have better protocols in the prison for their prisoners. That they should be treated more like human beings rather than animals when it comes down to something like a pandemic or how you treat them during such a time.</br></br>

UCI: Absolutely.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah. People don't tend to think of them as being human beings because they've made mistakes.</br></br>

UCI: Absolutely. And we're so thankful for your testimony, I will be here, or you know, we will be here 'til 9 o'clock.
