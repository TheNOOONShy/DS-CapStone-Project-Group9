This story was told by a person incarcerated at New Creek.</br></br>Caller: Bad. You know, every time I call home, they worried about me. You know, I keep myself clean, I wash my clothes. You know, take care of my hygiene and stuff like that.</br></br>I’m in a crew up here where that we clean and we sanitize exercise equipments every day. I’m out from like six in the morning until like four in the evening until I walk back down for count. Then go back out around 4:45 all the way until seven o’clock.</br></br>You know, so I’m up there sanitizing the benches, the weight bars, the door handles. Anything metal or steel or whatever’s around the yard, we sanitize it. We go around every 30 minutes to an hour to do it, you know, so we keep everything clean. A lot, you know.</br></br>UCI: How have you been coping with everything?</br></br>Caller: I stay positive. I try to stay positive by reading about it. Sometimes I go to the dorm by myself and my music and I cry and I think about things. You know, I get myself back to reality, you know.</br></br>Right now, this facility that I’m on right now is at level two. It’s one of the best level two in Southern California. A lot of guys can agree to it, you know. You hear a lot of violence, a lot of people look out for one another.</br></br>But one thing I do notice is that when the virus hit, a lot of people got together and started helping others out. And that, you don’t really see that in prisons. I don’t care where you at, you really don’t see that. In here, everybody stepped up and help each other out, you know.</br></br>If you didn’t have something and you need it, they gave it to you. Cosmetics, food to eat or stuff like that, you know. So, it’s pretty resting that everyone came together.</br></br>From Monday up until today, we had a walkathon everyday from 8:30 to 11:30 for yard time. Each yard is three buildings so, each building had a chance to do their own thing each day. I got blessed to come up with that idea “Let’s have a walkathon for our victims”. Since we can’t have guests, we did it on our own.</br></br>We did it on our own, so it was a blessing. I had praise from the captain and everybody’s like you did a good job. And I’m like “Look, I’m just doing what’s right. I told the guys when you jog, think of your victims. You know, each step you do is in remembrance of your victims.</br></br>You know, I got like three victims and I did 15 laps you know. I did 15 laps, you know. Five after each victim, you know. So, it was pretty good. We talked about it with a moment of silence before we left and broke up.</br></br>So, I’m trying to stay positive. That keep me in the right track by helping people doing the right thing.
