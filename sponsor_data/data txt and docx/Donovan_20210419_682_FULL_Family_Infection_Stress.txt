PrisonPandemic,</br></br>

First and foremost, I would like to thank everybody involved in this awesome project for reaching out to people like myself! I’m extremely glad to hear that there’s good people out in the community who are very motivated, and committed to making a difference. Thank you.</br></br>

Well I find myself in good health, and high spirits. Finally CDCR opened up the visiting so I get to hug and spend some quality time with my loved ones. My family they have to cross the San Diego border, Tijuana, to come visit me. So it can be stressful for them to receive any info about me.</br></br>

Yeah! My mom she gets extremely worried because she is not able to cross, only my sisters can. COVID-19 has put so much stress on my body. Mentally it has affected my mood, and the way I see the world now. It was painful seeing people who you actually knew get very sick and suddenly pass away, die.</br></br>

Yeah! I feel for all the families who are dealing with loved ones who have passed away from COVID-19. And I know how it feels to lose someone who you love or was not able to forgive nor say goodbye. My father, he died a while back so I can relate.</br></br>

I have a beautiful family who loves me so much and kept me busy through these trials and tribulations. God willing I’ll make it home sooner than later. My release date is 2024 but hopefully CDCR can get with the program and let me go.</br></br>

I was trying to keep myself busy by writing music and poems. It was a struggle for a long time. Not being able to walk on the yard or just being able to breathe fresh air. But I’m glad that things are getting back to normal.</br></br> 

And I am going to try to call you, and maybe I can share some stuff with you on the phone.</br></br>

I wrote this poem I hope that you guys can understand it because I write using slang words. Yeah! I know that’s not cool right? haha.</br></br>

Again I want to thank you and everyone who is involved in this program. For reaching out to people like me. Sorry for my ugly writing. Haha.</br></br>

I wish nothing but the best for you, and I hope that my letter finds you in the best of health. Thank you for writing me.</br></br>

From.</br></br>

I wrote this poem a while back. Maybe at the beginning.</br></br>

Poem.</br></br>

Allah help me</br></br>

Stay strong through</br></br>

The trials and tribulations</br></br>

I’m bored out of my mind,</br></br>

And I’m losing my patience</br></br>

Fear, worry, and frustration</br></br>

Yeah! I feel just</br></br>

Like a mental patient.</br></br>

Trap in a straight-jacket</br></br>

Force to stay put in isolation</br></br>

Donovan State Prison-</br></br>

Struggling to breathe</br></br>

From lack of ventilation-</br></br>

Allah help me</br></br>

Overcome these trials and tribulations.</br></br>

And bless me</br></br>

With a spirit of endurance</br></br>

I want to be set free,</br></br>

Physically, mentally,</br></br>

But most importantly spiritually.</br></br>

I’m living in times</br></br>

Of great depression</br></br>

A virus that has affected</br></br>

All nations</br></br>

COVID-19 is hella scary</br></br>

And a true crisis,</br></br>

Allah I can’t wait for this evil</br></br>

Pandemic to just fade away like ISIS.
