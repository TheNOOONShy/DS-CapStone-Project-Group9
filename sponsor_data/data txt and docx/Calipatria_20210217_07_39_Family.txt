This story was told by a person incarcerated at Calipatria.</br></br>

UCI: And what does that reduced visitation and programming been like in terms of being able to see your family, like, how has that affected you?</br></br>

Caller: Well, the phone calls. We are not allowed to get more than, like, one phone call a day. So that's kind of like, it's a little strain on your relationship with like, like my girl.</br></br> 

So, with my ex-girl. And then, yeah it was, it was a little messed up. And then visits. Also visits. Visits suck cause you can't, I couldn't see my girl for a long time.</br></br> 

Well, still I can't see her. Now they're providing video visits, but yeah. And then, you only get one of those a month. So yeah. It sucks.</br></br>

UCI: Wow. That must be really hard-</br></br> 

Caller: It's not a-huh?</br></br> 

UCI: I'm sorry what were you saying?</br></br>

Caller: No, no, no, you go.</br></br>

UCI: I was just saying that, that must be really hard, and how are you coping with the crisis?</br></br>

Caller: Well, I got it good cause I told you, like I said, I'm a porter out here. So, I get to run around and, you know what I mean, help people out that don't get a chance to get out their cells, like I'm out here most of the day.</br></br>

So, I got it pretty good, you know what I mean, but other people they don't. They're stuck in their cells 24 hours a day. They only come out to shower and then take you back in your cell. So, that might be a little hectic on you, you know what I mean?</br></br>

UCI: Mhmm.
