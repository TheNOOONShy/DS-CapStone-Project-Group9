This story was told by a person incarcerated at New Folsom.</br></br>

Caller: Once, because everybody - everybody in prison has to be in their cell at 4:00 every day for institutional count statewide. So I notice he didn't come back at count time, so I'm asking the CO that's doing count, “Where's my celly?” "Oh, he didn't come back?" I said, "No." "We don't know who," so I said, "Okay" I just waited.</br></br>

So he didn't come back the whole night. So the next day come I asked you know CO, "Hey what’s," you know, "What's going on with my celly," you know, and he was like "Oh, he's in a CTC." I say "CTC, for what?" He was like, "I don't know. They ran some blood tests" and whatnot and they, you know, "Something's going on with him.</br></br> 

So he's, he's in CTC, he's in, what they call it, an outpatient unit or something like that. And, you know, so I was kind of worried so, you know, day after day was going by. So I finally got, you know, some information 'cause I saw another nurse that I knew, and you know, kind of was inquiring, you know, about my cellmate. And she was like, "Oh, he's in CTC. He had COVID symptoms, and they ran some tests."</br></br>  

And you know, he had, I guess, COVID symptoms I don't know if he had what they say he had actual COVID or he was having COVID symptoms. So I said, "COVID," so I was like, "Wow," and then I noticed, and I kind of believed in what they were saying because he got visits his family used to come and see him and visits or whatnot. So I kind of configured he probably caught it that way.</br></br>

Plus he, he used to go to group and things like that. So he could have caught it from the staff member. So I said, "You know what, let me" I didn't have any symptoms or anything. I didn't have I wasn't feeling any symptoms.</br></br>

So I said, "Wow," so I said, "Well, let me, you know, get a COVID swab and all that. Let me get checked out." Just in case, you know, something might be wrong with me 'cause I wasn't feeling any symptoms and come to find out I had COVID. And but they said that, but I asked them, I said, "Well, what, why I wasn't feeling, having any symptoms."</br></br>

And they was like, "Well, sometimes you don't feel any symptoms from the beginning, but, you know, sometimes after a while, you start feeling symptoms." So they quarantine me. So then there's a special unit on the way on the other side, of the yard is a special unit building where they put all people who, who have COVID and they quarantine them. So they took me by force it wasn't even like I didn't even have an option.
