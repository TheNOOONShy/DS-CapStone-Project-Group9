This story was told by a person incarcerated at Donovan.</br></br>


UCI: So what do you think could’ve made the situation better?</br></br>


Caller: If they never would’ve brought the guy here.</br></br>


UCI: Yeah.</br></br>


Caller: You know somebody’s got--I mean why would you put somebody around people that’s not infected? I mean, you know, it’s like they didn’t care. You put us all in harm’s way when you put somebody here that’s got COVID, nobody else had it.</br></br>


UCI: Yeah, that doesn’t make a whole lot of sense that they would do that.</br></br>


Caller: ‘Cause here on this yard we got microwaves, we have different stuff, phones and all that, and we all use the same things.</br></br>


UCI: And when that happened, they weren’t, like, sanitizing or giving you anything to clean?</br></br>


Caller: No, and we got no sanitizer, what’s going on was no, um--the guy was able to walk around us, use the microwave, he had access to everything we had access to.</br></br>


UCI: Oh.</br></br>


Caller: Until it was too late. Until it was too late, they wind up moving him out of here, but he was already--they had left him here like a week or something. And he already had COVID. You know, it was too late. We were already exposed already by the time they moved him out of here.</br></br>


UCI: Yeah, I get that. That’s not good.</br></br>


Caller: And then they wrote me up. I sent a copy of--I wrote a letter to y’all, and I sent a copy of what took place and everything, so I hope y’all get it.</br></br>


UCI: Yeah, I think they’re going through letters today, they got a lot of letters yesterday and today, so they’re going through those.</br></br>


Caller: Yeah, so, um, it’s just not a good situation and I’m just taking it one day at a time.</br></br>


UCI: Well, hopefully it starts to get better as people get the vaccine and all of that.</br></br>


Caller: Okay.</br></br>


UCI: Do you have anything else you’d like to share?</br></br>


Caller: I just wanna say that hopefully, you know, to be more--I appreciate what you guys are doing, I hope it gets more attention that people in here died in here, people was real sick and they never recovered from this situation.</br></br>


UCI: Yeah, that’s our goal, we wanna bring attention to it.</br></br>


Caller: You know, people need to see their families, people need to, you know, get back connected with their loved ones and everything.</br></br>


UCI: Uh huh, I totally understand that.</br></br>


Caller: A lot of people lost their wives, their family and everything due to not being able to see them.</br></br>


UCI: Yeah.</br></br>


Caller: I worry--You know, they had--people had to get tested before they even come see you. Seventy-two hours, they have to swab ‘em again, you know, it’s a headache to try to get a visit.</br></br>


UCI: Wow, that’s a lot of work to get one hour visit. Hopefully--</br></br>


Caller: Yeah, that’s true.</br></br>


UCI: --it starts to get better.</br></br>


Caller: I, well, I pray that it do. I hope that it gets better.
