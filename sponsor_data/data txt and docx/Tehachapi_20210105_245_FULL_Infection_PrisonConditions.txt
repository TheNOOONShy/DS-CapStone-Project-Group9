Dear PrisonPandemic,</br></br> 	

1.4.21</br></br>

I’m writing this vague brief letter to give you somewhat of an understanding of what it’s been like here in CDCR during the COVID crisis period.</br></br>

1. On or about 12.11.20, I was placed on isolation because of symptoms I was experiencing.</br></br> 

2. It turns out that I caught the virus from my cellmate who was hospitalized and placed on ventilation because his condition was worsening. This happened on a Thursday second week of the isolation.</br></br>

3. During the period of isolation I had to come to the terms that I very well may die. Headache, dehydration, cold sweats and cough were just a few symptoms I’ve suffered and endured.</br></br>

4. As I’m sure you can imagine how filthy prisons can be. Well this one in particular is not excluded. For example, a gross shortage of supplied especially chemicals to keep an inmate’s living area clean.</br></br>

5. Lack of education of law serious and dangerous the virus is is another issue at hand. The failure to wash hands appropriately and wear masks out in the open is another.</br></br> 

6. The most important issue at hand is the institutional phones which is a magnet for contracting and spreading the virus, and is how I believe my cellmate caught it, and passed it onto me.</br></br> 

8. The failure to report symptoms to the nurse is also another because no inmate wants to be placed on isolation for fear of losing (temporarily) petty privileges packages, canteen and etc,. etc, very sad but true an inmate comfortability is of more value than his life. That is the mindset of the majority.</br></br> 

In closing I’d like to add that although an inmate especially if indigent with no way or means to purchase his own cleaning supplies such as shampoo, soap, and etc., can only keep himself clean as the state institution allows and or provides. With this being said it is my hope that this info is put to use for the benefit of the whole world.</br></br>

Sincerely</br></br>
And</br></br>
Respectfully</br></br> 
Submitted</br></br>

Postscript: Currently I’m fully recovered and off isolation./br></br>
