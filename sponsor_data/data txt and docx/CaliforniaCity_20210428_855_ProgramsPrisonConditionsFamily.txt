I almost forgot to mention that the facility did not run canteen at one point because it was too much work without the inmates’ help. Do you know how much canteen means to us? I cannot survive on a bologna sandwich and a dinner that can equal the size of a Happy Meal. I need my canteen!</br></br>


In March this year, the prison offered the Moderna vaccine to every inmate. We had the option to refuse but the majority of us took the vaccine just so we can move on from this modified program.</br></br> 


We want our regular visits and have the chance to get out of our cells. At this moment, we still are only allowed one hour or two in the dayroom each day. Yard is still three a week with my pod only and they have finally started running education for those enrolled. I can’t wait for everything to get back to normal. Time moves slower when you’re stuck in a cell all day.</br></br>


As far as safety, I did not worry because we all had to wear masks and had minimal contact with COs. One event that was real difficult and still affects me is my older sister passing away. She passed due to other circumstances. She did not get a proper funeral because of the restrictions L.A. County had at the time. Matter of fact, those free phone calls helped a lot in those difficult times…</br></br>


How have I been coping with the crisis? Fortunately, I was able to continue with my college education through correspondence. I had nothing but time to focus on my assignments. I really appreciate the fact that the college allowed us to continue through all this. Reading books is another pastime of mine.
