UCI: How has the situation at your facility affected your loved ones?</br></br>

Caller: Horribly, you know? I can’t - I can’t have no visits. And, you know, I can’t send stuff out like, you know, I’m Native American, and I can’t send my beadwork out to send to my family, religious items or anything like that. It’s been very rough, you know? Especially for us Native Americans, we’re already going through it as it is right here.</br></br>

In the facility, they are denying us our spiritual rights right here in this facility, as Native Americans. They’re trying - they accommodate everybody else religious rights except for us, us Natives. We have a grounds, but we can’t get to it.</br></br> 

We have spiritual items in the chapel that we can’t have no access to it, but they give access to the Muslims. They give access to any other religion. But the Native Americans, I think, is kinda, like, I hate to say it, but I think it’s kinda a racist prison or whatever.</br></br>

But who am I to say what really is going on, ‘cause nobody’s telling us nothing. Everybody’s just telling us, "Oh, due to COVID, you can’t have -" Well then, why isn’t it, they, you telling the Christians, the Muslims, and the Catholics that? Why are we put on the back burner all the time with our spiritual, spiritual needs?</br></br>

And that’s a big thing here, and we keep getting denied just because we’re inmates and they got the upper hand. It’s like, we’ve been, we’ve been trying to fight for all that since I’ve been here. And we haven’t got nowhere.
