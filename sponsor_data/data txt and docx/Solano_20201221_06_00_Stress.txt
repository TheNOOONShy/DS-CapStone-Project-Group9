This story was told by a person incarcerated at Solano.</br></br>Caller: Yes. The institution had no cases at all. Until transfers came from other institutions with positive people. That’s how the eruption of what’s going on today.</br></br>UCI: Wow and so how have you guys been able to, to cope with that? Are you guys getting, you know, any outside time? Are you getting any, anything that is helping you guys?</br></br>Caller: Well, we were, but they shut everything down because the pandemic is going so rapid. So, everybody pretty much like I think 14 days pretty much isolation and quarantined, within your buildings and, you know, people are dealing with it and the cold part is, you know, in a time like this, you know.</br></br> 

For us it’s a lot of  growth, I mean people who have been down for a long time, we been through it, you know, deal with every situation and circumstances and whatever, tryna do what we can do. But the hardest part to me is, you know, they don’t have mental health for a lot of these dudes that really need it, that never dealt with it. And I think that slacking of that doesn’t help the cause of a person going through a crisis.</br></br>As far as not being able to deal with it, you know, and to me I think that’s a big thing no matter how shit come in, too. You know areas like that to be able to ask questions, if people need to talk to ‘em to be able to, you know what I’m sayin’? 

Some comfort, I mean, if people can’t see their loved ones but mentally it’s a lot of mental strain for a lot of people. You know, and the stress level is high for a lot of these guys and to me mental health should really be the focal point for a lot of individuals here. Especially when you’re goin’ through something like this that they’ve never experienced.
