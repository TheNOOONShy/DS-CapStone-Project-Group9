UCI: How have you been coping with the crisis inside?</br></br>       
 
Caller: I think I have been taking the mantle of activism. It's one of the reasons why I’m telling this. We have done 602s, we have done a little bit of like awareness on they are, as opposed to couple of months back but nobody had a hope of seeing anything.</br></br> 

I think that ultimately I just kinda stick to my friends and just sit down on my bunk and try to be as clean as possible. Just stay away from the guards all together because I know that my peers can’t really give it to me unless they are talking to them, I just kind of stay away from those who want to be talking to people in the office all the time. But I’m into doing things that are both spiritually-minded and practical.
