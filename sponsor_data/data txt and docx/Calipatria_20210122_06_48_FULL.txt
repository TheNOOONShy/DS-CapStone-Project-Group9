This story was told by a person incarcerated at Calipatria.</br></br>

Caller: And they were telling us, hey, if we test positive, basically they’re telling us in order to come off of quarantine we have to test positive.</br></br> 

You got people here that test negative like up to 10 times, have papers each time they tested negative and all that type of stuff. But they’re telling us based on that, they couldn't kill it with the proper chemicals and stuff like that to contain it, it’s pretty much basically everybody catches it.</br></br> 

They’re not saying that that we, like they want us to catch it, but they’re implying that. They’re saying like the basic thing they could do is we have to fight fire with fire. And we’re like what does that mean?</br></br>

Like we’ve been quarantined for so long, we’ve been on this modified program, we get this pass like yard with all type of stuff. When you catch it, originally they would make you, they would move you to a different yard. And they would, at the same time they’re moving people out, they’re moving people in. So we were like, well we’re not gonna move no more, like what’s the point of moving? Because uh if you’re steady bringing people in, how are we supposed to stop catching it?</br></br> 

And they’re, and they’re bringing people back that have caught it already and sayin’ that they’re alright, they’re cool ‘cause once they catch it, you’re able, you’re able not to pass it and such and such. But at the same time they’re still leaving the other people here that can, that can catch it from other COs and other inmates that they move into the building.</br></br>

So it’s like a cycle of like you’re tryna force us all to catch it, and that’ll be it. It was a- it’s another situation that happened with somebody that ended up having it, but I can’t say that situation because personally ‘cause I feel like it will give up too much exact of my location. But it’s been a lot of stuff goin’ on with people.</br></br> 

UCI: I'm so sorry to hear that. It's heartbreaking, truly. How has the situation changed in the beginning of the pandemic, were they doing anything differently? I know you said that they started doing those things around November, October, but maybe like March, April or even June, July, were they doing anything?</br></br> 

Caller: They were, they weren’t doing nothin’, no they weren’t. They weren’t doin’ nothin’ of that sort.</br></br>

UCI: I understand.</br></br> 

Caller: They were just, we had regular like stuff like that. And now they’re tellin’ us we can’t have visits with our family unless we had COVID-19 already. And we’re like okay what if we tested negative? Why can’t we have our visits? And they said because we could still possibly be transporting it or what not. Which we understand but it’s like nobody has a real concrete plan to maneuver us, and shut it down and contain it.</br></br> 

They did one- they did an early release one time. You have people here that’s less than 60 days to the house, couple of months to the house and stuff, that are not violent offenders, they’re not sex offenders, they’re not like people that should be deemed like you know what I’m sayin’? Like why aren’t they being released early to make more room and stuff like that? </br></br> 

And they’re not doin’ it. They did it one time and they stopped.</br></br> 

UCI: I understand.</br></br>

All that stuff it’s just like it’s just crazy like it’s really wild. They uh, they used to have spray bottles outside the showers to clean the showers after each person showered, they stopped that. They used to make us like uh, they just, it’s everything they was doin’ to profile it. Like it’ll be strict for like a few days and after that it’s like whatever, whatever happens, happens.</br></br>

UCI: So it seems like they’ve just given up on you guys?</br></br> 

Caller: Pretty much. I wouldn’t say, I wouldn’t say so far like on some, they pretty much did though. Because that one time they were pretty much sayin’ okay, uh they stopped it, they stopped, this is where we thought they messed up first, because obviously we can’t give it to each other so it’s gonna come from the outside.</br></br> 

We understand you guys are gonna, the proper COs and staff they’re gonna uh, be seein’ their families and stuff like that. When they first, when they first did it they shut the, when they shut the, when they first shut the prison onto this like COVID protocol or whatever, all they had servin’ us was the COs. And we were like how are you guys the only ones serving us when you’re the ones giving us? We should still be able to service our food. How we was doin’ it.</br></br> 

But, and then but as soon as that happened like two weeks later, more spikes started happening, more spikes started happening so we like, the only way that’s goin’ on is y’all given’ it to us.</br></br> 

UCI: Wow. My gosh. So when is the last time that you were able to visit with your family members?</br></br> 

Caller: Uhhh since January of last year.</br></br>

And that, and that, and that’s through visit, video visit, whatever.</br></br> 

UCI: Oh, are they offering video visits? Or not even that either?</br></br> 

Caller: They were supposed to have it up and runnin’, but then they only had it up and runnin’ for like a couple of prisons. And then when they was ‘bout to run it here for us, they told us if you had, if you didn’t catch COVID you can’t, you can’t go. Even if we tested negative they said we can’t go to a video visit. I haven’t had a visit since at least January of last year, for sure.</br></br> 

UCI: Wow. That's crazy. That's shocking, honestly.</br></br>

We’re allowed, we’re, sometimes we’re allowed one 15-minute phone call a day, sometimes it might be two days, or every other like it always switches up. And then if your day is not on a free day and your family don’t have money on the phone, then you’re just, you’re, excuse my language, you’re assed out.</br></br> 

UCI: Right, I understand. Have you found any coping mechanisms to deal with this? I mean I’m sure it’s very hard to not talk to your family for over a year.</br></br>

Caller: I haven’t seen, I’ve been able to talk to ‘em. I’ve been able to talk to ‘em. I wasn’t, not sayin’ I wasn’t able to talk to them at all, I’ve been able to talk to ‘em. But actually see them and stuff like that, that’s hard yeah but you gotta, luckily you have a lil’ small support system for letters and you try to read and I cope like that.</br></br> 

But at the same time it’s like, we’re in, a lot of laws had recently just got passed for CDC for what we’re supposed to have. Be out of our cells longer and go have more yard, have more day room, and there were restrictions about how long we could be on lockdown, where it couldn’t be longer than 14 days. But now all that stuff is going out the window.</br></br>

So now we’re back to the same old things. We don’t have nothin’ to do, we’re just sittin’ here. You guys are not runnin’ no programs, you’re not rehabilitating anyone, you’re not rolling no staff programs, you’re not runnin’ no groups, you’re not runnin’ no nothing to actually rehabilitate people.</br></br> 

We’re just sitting here doing dead time. Nobody’s gettin’ milestone credits, nobody’s gettin’ things to earn time off, nobody’s learning any trade, we’re just sitting here, we’re just stuck.</br></br> 

UCI: I'm so sorry. And have, you haven’t caught COVID, correct?</br></br>

Caller: So, see and this is another thing, now I don’t wanna throw like no big ol’, sound like I’m a weird conspiracy theorist or somethin’ like that, but I feel like I’ve had COVID, I felt like I had it. But every time I’ve tested, I’ve, me personally, I have tested negative.</br></br> 

But I’ve felt like I’ve had it and there’s been people, that we know for a fact had it, they said they lost they sense of smell, they know they they uh, they had the chills and things like that and uh, and they went to test and they came back negative so we like, are they testing who they wanna test? Or we’re like what’s goin’ on?</br></br> 

‘Cause we don’t, so for a minute, because they was doin’ all the stuff, we all said like we’re, people, we’re not gonna test for a little bit whatever the case may be. But then when we all test we’re all negative, but then a test or two later, positives will come up.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah I’m sure that’s, that’s very confusing especially if you’re feeling symptoms or, or someone you know is feeling symptoms.</br></br> 

Caller: Exactly, that’s very confusing.</br></br> 

UCI: So right now it seems like they’re very um all over the place with their procedures. They haven’t told-</br></br> 

Caller: They have no set, they have no set plan whatsoever. It’s been somethin’ different literally every single week. It’s been somethin’ different, we hear somethin’ different.</br></br> 

UCI: I see, and have you heard anything from the staff about what they think about it, about anything that they feel?</br></br> 

Caller: Yeah. Yes, I’ve heard a CO say it’s bullshit, basically, unless we all catch it, it’s just gon’ keep goin’ on for a minute. Because once they feel like we all catch it, then they can, it that we can’t pass it between each other.</br></br> 

I’ve heard a CO that catchin’ it come back, and at first they be implementing it so hard like wear ya mask, wear ya mask, wear ya mask. Then sometimes they come without wearing they mask. We’ll say stuff like where’s, why ain’t yo mask on? Then he'll yell back like, “oh I already had it” or something like that.</br></br> 

Or uh, and we’ve asked about, you know we’re not too educated on the vaccines, so we asking about, we be asking about the vaccines and stuff like that, they’re supposed to be starting to implement it. And we have COs that’ll tell us, “oh I’m not taking that shit, I’m not…” you know stuff like that, so we’re confused on that end.</br></br> 

All just, all different types of stuff.</br></br> 

UCI: Alright, and have they given you any masks? Or anything else besides, I know you said they had a spray in the shower before?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, they used to have spray bottles outside the shower so that way you could spray it down, the whole shower down, before you go in there, you know what I’m sayin’?</br></br>

And at first they was, and they they’ll teeter totter on that, one minute they would give us showers everyday, the next time they’ll give us showers every other day, they tell us we’re supposed to be clean and all this and all that, and they’ll go to passing out disinfectant everyday, 
to not passing the disinfectant.</br></br> 

They’re constantly runnin’ out of toilet paper, sayin’ they’re short on supplies due to this and that, like that that so that’s that be a whole thing too when you have to, you know what I’m sayin’ do humanly functions and you don’t even have nothin’ to you know what I’m sayin’, relieve yourself properly.</br></br> 

UCI: Mhm.</br></br> 

Caller: And so that’s not, that’s not cool.</br></br> 

UCI: Right, and is there anything else that you wanted to share that you had just experienced while being in there? It doesn’t have to be COVID related.</br></br> 

Caller: Na, I’ma uh, it’s been a couple of incidents but they’ve been like specific incidents, and I don’t wanna speak on ‘em for, you know.</br></br> 

UCI: Yeah, that’s fine.</br></br> 

Caller: ‘Cause it, it’s actually some COVID thing but they’ve happened exclusively where I’m at. So it’s like I don’t wanna, you know? I know they have incidents everywhere so they can, any common incident they would never know, but if I say the exact things ‘cause you know?</br></br> 

UCI: Yeah, exactly and I want you to protect yourself as much as you can and you don’t have to share anything that you don’t want to.</br></br>

Caller: But I appreciate what y’all doin’, shoot like when somebody, when somebody had got that, you know what I’m sayin’, when I was aware that you guys were doin’ this man, ‘cause somebody needs to somethin’ and like put it out there somehow.</br></br> 

So that way people could see it and hopefully, the right person sees it and asks the right questions and shakes the right trees because, how do they not have somebody of a higher medical, CDC certified, executing a plan with these guys and putting that plan into motion and sticking with that plan to, in order for us to get through this pandemic in uh, shit, a mature way.</br></br> 

‘Cause right now it’s just games being played with us. And regardless of the mistakes that we make, we’re still human.</br></br> 

UCI: Yeah I agree 100 percent, and that’s our goal with the website that we’re going to be creating, it’s going by PrisonPandemic UCI so in the future, once we have it up, we would love for you to visit it, and um see all the other stories that we’ve posted on there as well.</br></br> 
 
And then lastly, if you don’t have anything else to share or um if you could even relay the message to anyone else that you know might have a story to share that would be greatly appreciated.</br></br> 

Caller: I most definitely will do that.</br></br>

UCI: Okay great, thank you so much for participating in PrisonPandemic and um, we hope that you continue to stay safe in there, okay?</br></br> 

Caller: Okay, thank you.</br></br> 

UCI: Thank you.
