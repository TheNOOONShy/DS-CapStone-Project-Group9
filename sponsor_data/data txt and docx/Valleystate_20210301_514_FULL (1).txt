PrisonPandemic,</br></br>
Thank you for writing and having concern for my well being during this pandemic. Not many people have concern for the average prisoner such as myself. Especially since losing my mother some years ago to cancer. She was my main connection to the outside world.</br></br>
So I’d love to share my story. I have no problem sharing my first name and the prison I reside. Change, (positive reform) will only come by sharing the truth of each institution.</br></br>
I can only share the treatment I experienced here at Valley State Prison. I feel I have an objective view and can shed some light on many of the inside problems. These problems only exacerbate a fragile system.</br></br>
My name is [Redacted]. I’m 43 years old. I reside here at VSP. I tested positive for COVID-19 approx. 120 days ago. I only knew this because I have been testing again every Monday since my “90 days of immunity” have run out.</br></br> 
I moved five times within the 90 days. Sick or well the CO’s bring you a handful of bags and tell you to “pack up, you’re moving!” To refuse is a 115 write up for refusing and most likely you’ll still be moving.</br></br>
With prior knowledge of this aversive move- punishment, people start to refuse the COVID test. Whole cells would rather quarantine in place with people they feel safe living around.</br></br>
The Assistant Warden comes to our building C1 to tell us that if we refuse the test we go to Administrative Housing Unit to quarantine anyway but with a write-up for refusal to test. Write-ups remove your “good time credits” which ultimately keeps you inside prison longer.</br></br>
As two of my cellies test positive and the officers have them pack up and they move them to a building with other positive tested inmates. We are told to pack up and wait for instructions. About ten or 11 p.m. they move us to Ad-seg cells to await evaluation which consisted of temperature checks three times a day.</br></br>
Isolation with showers every other day. Two days later I start to feel sick but I’m not positive if it is COVID symptoms or withdraw from them missing my depression medicine for the past two days. The end of the second day during medication call they have me kicking my door to not miss my medication for a third time in a row.</br></br>
At this time, I am sick, shivering with cold sweats, and my lungs hurt. I know it is COVID by the pain in my breathing. That night when the medical staff came around checking temperatures I ask what my temperature was, and she tells me it is a little high probably because I’m wearing sweats and sweater. I told her no! I’m wearing this because I am freezing and sick.</br></br>
I wanted to know at what temperature do they do something and I could not get an answer. I felt powerless. The recommendation was drink plenty of water. I realized that temperature checks were only a formality.</br></br>
There was a guy next door who was kicking his door for about 30 minutes, screaming “Man down, I can't breathe!” before someone showed up to help. It was about one a.m. and to get a guards attention about ten more cells helped him by yelling and kicking doors also.</br></br>
I hurt for that man and felt scared but angry. I closed my eyes and just prayed.</br></br>
After two weeks inside that cell they test me again (quick test). Two days later they tell me to pack up, I’m moving from observation to quarantine. Now in a big cell with one other man from my original cell, I was happy I did not land in the chapel with no bathroom, shower, etc.</br></br>
I stayed in that cell for two more weeks. After not showing symptoms for some days they have us move to general population.</br></br>
I’m confronted at my new cell door by a man asking me where I came from. After telling him, he aggressively tells me that I’m not coming into that room and to go tell the C.O.’s that I’m refusing housing! This man was fearing getting sick due to the lack of information by the prisons and confusion on the news.</br></br>
Now again I’m in a state of powerlessness where I have a man aggressively (and twice my size) telling me to stay out and a C.O. telling me go in or suffer consequences. After the officer talked with the cell they allowed me in. The worst night of the COVID experience.</br></br>
I could not cough, sneeze, or anything with those men telling something crazy like I’m a plagued sick, dying person trying to get them sick. Two weeks later they start separating us again. “Positives” from those who never tested positive.</br></br>
I moved one more time since then due a pipe that broke in my room. So how can I keep myself safe when the rules for us inmates are different than the rules of our overseers the guards.</br></br>
So I have heard that things are changing for the better but still see much negligence and inconsistencies in how positive tests are being handled. We are human beings too.
