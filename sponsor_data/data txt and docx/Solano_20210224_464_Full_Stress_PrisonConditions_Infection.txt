This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Solano.</br></br>

I hope this letter finds you in perfect good health! Thank you for the lovely heartwarming message. Which had brought a big smile upon my face. I truly pray that your team, and families, are OK. And everyone is standing firm, as a notion that’s rooting for better days ahead. Sincerely I really do.</br></br>

Here at Solano State Prison, I am doing 12 years. With half time I’m down to four years left to pull. I am 54 years of age, Black strong male, with a strong buff looking body, on the outside, but the inner parts I have health issues. I have stage four kidney disease. I’m doing well at this time, stronger than ever.</br></br>

My faith is keeping me strong and in control, praise God. I’m continuing to give him all the glory always. Visiting, well it’s painful for those who are allowed visitation. Because we want to see our loved ones as much as they want to see us.</br></br> 

It’s been tough on me. Mind blowing. Really. it truly has. I am really a strong person. I’ve been this way since such a young age, head strong.</br></br>

Here’s what’s going on here in Solano Prison. These staff members are crazy! They're bouncing bodies on other levels, here at Solano. This facility has four yards. A through D. C and D yards are level two yards.</br></br> 

I have been placed on the level three yard since I’m high risk. Along with 10 other individuals that's also high risk medical. Bad hearts, lungs, etc. Therefore, they took me from off the C, which is level two yard, and placed me on the level three yard. Into a cell single cell, for my protection from catching the COVID-19.</br></br>

I don’t have no cellie. That was the purpose. Brings us 10 over here to the cells. Making us single cell status, which is really good for us. Before coming over here to the level three yard, which is B yard, I was in a form of 10 inmates per dorm. That wasn’t good at all.</br></br> 

The ratio ball in the C yard building is 200 inmates per building. Each yard has six buildings per yard.</br></br>

So here’s the scoop now. They're trying to move us back to where we had come from. Even though I had both my COVID vaccine shots, it’s not right at all! They're trying to kill us here.</br></br>

Me and a bunch of other inmates had put in a 602 healthcare form asking to be released, but, that was asking way too much in their eyes. So instead of allowing us to be released, they come with the single cells act!</br></br>

So everyone here thats in Solano Prison haven’t been vaccinated yet. They started with the 75-and-down. I was so blessed to have gotten both vaccine shots. I am being threatened every other day from staffs here. Along with the other 10 individuals that come over here from the level two yard. Some are from D yards and some from C yard.</br></br>

I’m kind of afraid to be forced back over there. This prison isn’t protecting us, in this manner. This prison isn’t protecting us, in this manner. The CDC correctional policies isn’t treating us right, with trying to force another inmate in the cell with us. I’m done. Please write me back again. Please afraid.</br></br>

Sincerely yours. God bless you all. I love the team. I have to go. It’s dinner time. Have a blessed day. P.S. Fast.
