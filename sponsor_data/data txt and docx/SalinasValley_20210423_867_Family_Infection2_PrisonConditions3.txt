Also, we deal with the mental and emotional aspect of the cell and institutional lockdown. And NO inmates visiting can and do affect inmates and their families and relationships negatively.</br></br>

Including reduced and no contact visiting with family and loved ones and friends. We constantly deal with the mental and emotional stress. Yet I feel to some degree it’s necessary to keep inmates and their families and loved ones safe.</br></br>

As far as vaccinations in CDCR and SVSP it’s going fairly well, a few minor drawbacks. I got both my shots already, but notice a large walnut size knot appeared on my wrist. Same day I got first shot. Then when I get second shot in left shoulder, knot on wrist go down 80 percent then return in about 24 hours.</br></br>

Plus a small knot appeared between my shoulder (left) and my neck by the big blood vein behind left ear on same day I got my second COVID-19 shot. I’m putting in a CDCR medical sick call slip to see a doctor on it. I saw a doctor about knot on wrist, who simply felt it, then dismissed it as nothing. I’ll keep you posted.</br></br>

Now I must prepare for possible reprisal. For simply sharing my truth and story with you. As CDCR staff read all my letters and phone calls. Due to me being an inmate advocate for CDCR disabled inmates.</br></br>

Well I’m at the end of my recounts of incidents, experiences, etc., on COVID. Almost forgot the medical services and care has and continue to be extremely lacking since COVID-19 began. It’s a little better now here in SVSP. Also I was transferred without COVID test to another prison twice from LAC to CTF, when CTF had an outbreak of over 345 hundred.
