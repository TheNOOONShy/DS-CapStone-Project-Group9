Hi, I am a 27-year-old transfeminine non-binary person, she/her/hers/ms.</br></br> 

I write on behalf of myself, and of my friend, a 31-year-old female (mtf). She/her/hers/ms.  We are both incarcerated in CDCR. Myself 8 years in on a 15 to life, my friend 11 years in on LWOP.</br></br>

I've write to you seeking any type of assistance, from support, info, advice, up to and including legal representation for several high-impact, high-profile civil lawsuits we are undertaking.</br></br>

In CA, marriage is a right guaranteed to all, regardless of gender. My friend legally changed her gender to female in 2018. I very recently applied for my gender change to non-binary. In CA the only restriction on marriage is that it is not allowed by proxy. My friend and I were, at the time of our initial requests, cellmates. However, CDCR considered us both ‘male’ based on our biological presentation.</br></br>

CDCR informally denied us our to right to marry each other. By claiming we are same-sex, and using a 2013 CDCR memo subject “same-sex marriage between inmates”, as the basis for denial. The memo claims such marriages ‘are not permitted at this time’ due to ‘a legitimate penological objective.’ CDCR provides no evidence to support such claims. We are not same-sex, and in that ground alone, we have a right to marry. We will pursue this legally in order to secure this right. CA Supreme Court, 1983 claims ‘Monell action under 1983...” This matter is of high impact for LGBTQIA incarcerated folks, and their loved ones, on a national level.</br></br> 

In 2019, I was raped multiple times by a prison staff member. At the same time, my friend was sexually battered multiple times by the same person. We are both witness to what happened to each other. We did not immediately report, due to our fears of retaliation from staff.</br></br>

In 2020, we both transferred out of that prison, and on September 1, 2020, we both filed formal PAGA complaints to CDCR. CDCR has already retaliated us by separating us where we were cellmates. We both fear and know further retaliation is eminent, as that’s how PREA works in CDCR. We will be pursuing state torts, and 1983 8th and 4th Amendment violation actions against CDCR and the staff member. This will be a very high-profile case.</br></br> 

With the passage of SB132 in CA, allowing trans incarcerated to be housed according to their gender identity, my friend is seeking damages from CDCR for its deliberate indifference to the serious risk to my friend because of them housing her, a female, in a male institution. My friend had placed CDCR on notice of her safety concerns in 2018, and my friend was eventually sexually assaulted by a male staff. My friend has reserved her legal rights.</br></br>

I am bringing a 1983 action for CDCR’s deliberate indifference to my safety, resulting in me being a victim of five assaults by inmates and three assaults by staff. Prior to all of these, I notified CDCR multiple times, using multiple avenues, of my safety concerns; by verbal expression, by mail, by grievance, by my family contacting CDCR, and by my family contacting the ombudsman. I sustained physical injury, and a false rules violation report, and an extended stay in ASU.</br></br> 

Both my friend and I have suffered much retaliation for filing grievances, contacting attorneys and otherwise standing up for our rights.</br></br> 

Specifically, my friend filed two grievances and one staff complaint against a correctional officer. Ten days after my friend filed the staff complaint, correctional officer falsified a rules violation report charging my friend with ‘solicitation of bribery’ in retaliation for my friend's complaint.</br></br>

Further several of my friend's due process rights were violated in her disciplinary hearing. Denied an impartial hearing. Denied right to call friendly witnesses, coupled with hearing officer failure to document such denial. Denial of a fair opportunity to defend herself. Where LIO author of charge was allowed to be present during entire hearing, interrupting both my friend and hearing officer, allowed to participate in disposition phase, including influence hearing officer to cease sanctions against my friend, after correctional officer stated ‘that won’t hurt her’ and hearing officer subsequently did increase sanctions.</br></br> 

My friend was found guilty ‘based on a preponderance of evidence’ where correctional officers' report was only evidence. My friend is pursuing a state habeas for the RVR, as well as will pursue state torts against correctional officer and 1983 1st Amendment and retaliation claims.
