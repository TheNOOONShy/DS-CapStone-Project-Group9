Hi PrisonPandemic,</br></br> 


I appreciate the interest in our health. So first off, I did catch COVID-19 the day after Thanksgiving. No fever, but I lost my sense of taste and smell which has not fully come back.</br></br> 


But before that, we all knew that we would or expected that we would catch the virus before the vaccine was ready because of what happened in San Quentin, and that the hospitalization rate and fatality rate would be a bit higher, too. San Quentin’s Infection Fatality Rate (IFR) was around 0.8%. We expected the same here at the Deuel Vocational Institute in Tracy, California.</br></br> 


Masks were not distributed until well into the pandemic, here in prison.</br></br> 


My sister, a nurse, even tried to send me N95 masks because none were being provided (even cloth were not being provided), but the masks she mailed to me were not allowed through by CDCR. As far as the isolation and quarantines go, I suspect it was easier for me than most people who are not incarcerated - we are already used to isolation. Plus I am a zen buddhist now and am very comfortable in solitary meditation. Inmates and monks have this in common.</br></br>


Hope this helps! Please stay safe.</br></br> 


Kindest Regards.
