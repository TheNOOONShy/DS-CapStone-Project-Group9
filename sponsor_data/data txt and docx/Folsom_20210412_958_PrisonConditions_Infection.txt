This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Folsom.</br></br>

So far PrisonPandemic, I’ve been one of the lucky one who have not caught the deadly virus, that has turned this prison setting in a whole different direction for the worst for us incarcerated people. It has definitely been one scary and fearful situation trying out best not to catch the virus. But unfortunately, for some of us here at Folsom State Prison, It was impossible to dodge the virus.</br></br> 

And that’s because the people that runs this institution has continued to allow their employees who are infected with the virus to come on the facility rounds with only a temperature check.</br></br>

On top of that, they sent some of their officers to San Quentin State Prison to assist them with the massive outbreak of the virus, then allowed those same officers to come back here and work around the inmates. So, somewhere at the end of June 2020, a couple of correction officers and a nurse tested positive for the virus. So in July 2020, the medical staff COVID tested every inmate at this institution.</br></br> 

Not one inmate came back positive. But in August 2020, a free staff that worked in PIA tested positive for the virus. So again that same day, the medical staff tested all of the inmates.</br></br> 

But just like the first time, there weren't any positive tests coming back. But for some reason the warden decided to quarantine the inmates and shut down all movement for us. “No yard, no visits, no phone calls, no work, no school, no self help programs, and no walking to the chow hall.”
