This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Wasco.</br></br>

What facility are you currently housed at?</br></br> 

Right now I'm locked up in Wasco State Prison.</br></br>

What is the current COVID-19 situation at your facility?</br></br>

Well right now, this person has two of the COVID-19 vaccines. I do know one is JJ. Me, I’m not going to take not one of them. It’s just that I feel safe without them. My concern is the way the CO talk to people, and the way they treat people.</br></br>

What’s troubling me is that I’ve been in this reception prison since 3/20, it’s 3/21, when I was told that the max was four months. I also was told that if I don’t take the COVID-19 vaccine, I would be here for the rest of my time. I’ve saw a lot of people take the two shots, but I just don’t want to.</br></br>

The way this place handled COVID-19 in the beginning of the outbreak, was so bad that most of the people that got the COVID-19 was because they gave it to them. If someone refused to do what one of the COs say, they would take you and put you with somebody in a cell with COVID-19. Then after four days, the person that did not have COVID-19, would have it.</br></br.

When I got here in March, it was just starting to spread really bad. So they would try to lock the prison down. But by the time May got here, they had to do something different, or should I say try.</br></br>

I was in a dorm then with 150 men, when by then it only was suppose to be just eight people to a dorm. So we had 150 people in there, but to be real, no one picked up COVID-19 in the dorm when I was there. And I set there from March into June.</br></br>

June, they moved me to cells; that’s when people started getting COVID-19 left and right. I mean, it was like a domino effect. I don’t know if it’s in the air, but everyone around me got COVID-19. And when they found out that somebody got it, they would take them out the building fast and put them in another building.</br></br>

But some people don’t even have it, a they take them and put them in the building with the people with COVID-19. Then they wind up getting it, so sad. I set there and watched that go on from June into October.</br></br>

Then they put me back into the dorms, and again, it was over a 100 inmates in there. Some of them had COVID-19 already, some never had it at all like me. I was really afraid that I was going to get the COVID-19.</br></br>

So when I call my family and tell them what’s been going on, they tell me to wear my mask, which CDCR did give to us all. They are not good mask, but I can say they work. I set in the dorms again from October all they way to December. Then I went back to cell living and it was the same thing, everybody around me was getting COVID-19. Then it just stop, even before the vaccines it stopped.</br></br>

What would make the situation better at WASCO, is that if the COs were trained for things like COVID-19. Everybody that worked here act like they didn’t know what to do. I really don’t think it could have went any other way then what it is today.</br></br>

The way the COVID-19 situation at this place affected my loved ones, is that my family was so worried about fights breaking out because of COVID-19 and my health. They tell me to make sure I wash my hands, and keep the area around me clean, and to stay six feet away from the next person. All I can do is try, but it really is impossible to do so in WASCO state prison.</br></br>

What has it been like for you to have reduced visitation and programming?</br></br>

I tell you it’s not good because everyone is on edge. COs, It’s like anything can happen to anybody at anytime from another inmate. It’s so sad, because when I was in the dorms the COs would not let us watch the news at all.</br></br>

That made a lot of bad things happen inside the dorms because inmates wanted to know what was going on outside. But they would not let us see the news. And as far a visits, there was no visits at all.</br></br>

How have you been coping with the crisis?</br></br>

What I do is pray to god every day and night. I read my bible a lot and try my best to get other people to read theirs, or I read my bible to them. And I write to my family, I also have kids that I miss and love so much. And I always have in the back of my head that I will be out soon, in 2021 I will be home.</br></br>

What else do you want people to know about your experience?</br></br>

Well first of all, don’t go to jail. People should know that we are all human and we need to respect one another if you’re free or in jail. I’ve experienced that anything can happen at any time. We have to be prepared for anything at any time, and we have to stick together no matter what.</br></br>

We can get through anything if we do it together. I’ve also experienced that I really care about people, even though they don’t care about them self’s. I try to keep the peace no matter what. Love don’t hate…</br></br>

Thank you, UCI student</br></br>

I go home soon. I can’t wait to look on you all website and check it out, me and my family.</br></br>

PS. For the most part, the COs that work here did us wrong. It’s like the little respect that they almost had, was gone. Also, if I talk about them too bad, they won’t mail this out. So with that said, god bless you all. Keep up the good work.
