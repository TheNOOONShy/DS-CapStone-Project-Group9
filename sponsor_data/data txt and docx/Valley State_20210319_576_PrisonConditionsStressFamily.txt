Dear PrisonPandemic,</br></br> 


Even we outcasts and scum of society still need love and affection, even though we wouldn’t readily admit to it that way in public. So when VSP shuffled everyone around they not only disrupted the lives of inmates but also the bonds that they built with other inmates. Most everyone in prison want to go home, hence the reason we create comfortable cell living arrangements to help us worry about one less thing in here. When we’re on the yard we have to worry about if anyone is going to harm us and such, so our cell (or house as a lot of inmates call it) is our sanctuary.</br></br> 


But due to VSP’s COVID-19 protocols our sanctuaries have been destroyed. And every attempt to ask for convenience moves to reestablish our sanctuaries the CO’s act like typing a few words in a computer is hard for them to do. On top of it all, administration refuses to do convenience moves but for on the weekends. Yet come the weekends the staff don’t really want to do them and/or the regular building CO’s, which only do the moves for their respective buildings, swap shifts so they have the weekends off.</br></br> 


Thus bed moves don’t get done for months at a time. And to compound the problem VSP instead of sending recovered inmates back to their yards of origin they sent them all over the place. There are inmates that came from D yard on B, C, and A yard and vice versa. And doing moves between yards is like roping the moon. So now we all live in a state of hypertension due to the fact that we live with who they say we live with, with no readily available remedy.</br></br> 


Wow I got into that a little more than I intended, I guess this no convenience move is affecting me more than I thought. Moving on (no pun intended). We are allowed phone calls during 2 of the 4 hours we are allowed out of the cell. Again when we are allowed out there seems to be a lot more program lockdowns than before. Anyways when we are allotted  4 (15 minute) calls per cell (of 8 people) because they implemented a 15 minute dead period after each call.</br></br> 


But my question is this if we are a building full of recovered inmates why are we having a dead period, period? All in this building have either contracted the virus or are one of the very few who have received the vaccine. So again why the dead period? Speaking of vaccines they refuse to give the vaccine to recovered inmates saying that because we contracted it already we’re good to go. So why then are they regularly testing recovered inmates for COVID-19?</br></br>


It doesn’t make sense to me. We few who get visits have hated this pandemic. Not being able to have that time with your family for however sort of often is horrible. But lucky for us they came up with a video visit program which allows inmates to visit with their family through a Skype like app. Yet while it’s only a video visit and does not require the same supervision as in person visits they still limit visits to only the weekend. Wait what!?!?</br></br> 


Yes something that should be implemented through out the week, due to its simplicity, is still only done on weekends. Severely reducing the available time spaces for families to visit. Idiots run this place if you ask me but then again I’m just a criminal so what do I know right? All self-help groups are shut down. Yet the drugs and alcohol are still readily available as pre-pandemic. So addicts are tempted with their vices on the daily without any recourse to turn to a sponsor and/or group for support in not relapsing again.</br></br> 


On a plus side they do offer some self-help courses through the mail which is nice but doesn’t really help when it comes to need for immediate support. Religious services are shut down the religious leaders of all dominations do not walk around at all to see if someone might need their support morally, emotionally, spiritually or otherwise. Yet they all still collect a paycheck like they are fulfilling their duties to the fullest, WHAT!!??</br></br>
