This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Pleasant Valley.</br></br>

Things in prison have to change for the better. Following the rules and state guidelines go hand to hand. In other words, give us what we have coming as far as program, day room - yard, no limits on canteen, our family visits back.</br></br>

Last year was very stressful and depressing due to this COVID-19 outbreak. For the most part we were slim down in our cement box. Enough is enough. We are not animals to be locked down all the time.</br></br>

Letâ€™s put last year behind us as the past and start this year fresh with a positive attitude and more programs. And hope for the inmates to reunite with our families. At the end of the day everybody in this ward has a family. So please help the prison system change for the better. More hope for inmates to change.</br></br>
 
Live, love, and laugh United States of America. We all stand. We are all in this together. Thank you.
