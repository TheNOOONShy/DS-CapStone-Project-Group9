This story was told by a person incarcerated at OC Central Justice Central. </br></br>


UCI: Yes. So yeah. My next question to you was, since people have been getting vaccinated,  how's the vaccination situation been like at your facility? </br></br>


Caller: It was this year when they offered it. Most people were, you know, the people that did take it, they were complaining about, like, having headaches and everything and all that, but you know, there’s people that took it. But they started offering it to elderly people, and people that were overweight first, but it was it was like they were picking and choosing who they offered it to, which kind of throws me off- I was nearly you know when you're when you're sitting around, you're not doing much. </br></br>


I mean, everybody's just- there’s not much to exercise and can't run around, can’t really do too much exercise. Besides, you're sharing a little cell with another individual. An individual stress related push if they're able to or not, it's, it's pretty stressful. Again, a closed door for so long, it’s up to the individual, if they're able to program in that way and get a little workout going. There's not much you can do. </br></br>


But um, you know, the court situation has really, really, really, really surprised me as well. You know, you're just, you're sitting around, you know, you're sitting around. Vaccines and everything and like, I think, I think it was I heard that it was like, January? Yeah, it was January, it was January when there were talks about it. I think it was January, there's like talks about like, maybe jail will be getting some type of priority for vaccines, but I think it wasn't- I think it was March or February, like probably like late February. Or was it March? It wasn't, it wasn't April. February, March. </br></br>


And sort of asking people- it was mainly you know, the elders, those that were overweight, and it was you know, like yeah, they were offered the Moderna or the Pfizer. When you know people- people you know, if they didn’t take it it didn't matter what age they were if they’re overweight, but only if they're elderly. Yeah, they were offered that, so. </br></br>


I was, you know, I was never asked at that facility till- I think until like April, when they started handing out papers that like if you voluntarily want to get it- go ahead and put your name on his paper and then turn it in and then you'll be able to get it so- everybody else I guess or me as well. There's five people asked that even weren't overweight, they were given priority. So yeah it was very selective- was, you know, the vaccine. But then again that was the facilities that they, yeah it was offered.
