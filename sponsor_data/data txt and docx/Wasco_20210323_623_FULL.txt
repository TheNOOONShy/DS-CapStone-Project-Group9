This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Wasco.</br></br>Hello and to whom it may concern. First and foremost, good morning. I hope this letter finds you in good health. This is my first time writing somebody in the outside world. Excuse me if I correspond improper through this letter.</br></br>One of my fellow acquaintances had received a letter by you and brought it to my attention that he wasn’t interested in any type of way or form. I acquired the letter and decided that I’ll give it a shot and hope to gain a female companion to correspond with from here and on. At the end of the day, it’s wishful thinking.</br></br>Allow me to introduce myself, I’m a 30-year-old Hispanic, and a proud “Virgo.” I’m currently incarcerated within the “California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation” Wasco State Prison. I’ve been in the system (as they say) since the year “2012” and have a release date on the year “2025.”</br></br>I was young and really a part of the “street life.” Due to me being caught up in the fast life, I made a dramatic mistake that I am paying for now. It is my first time in prison. If you were to see my appearance you would think otherwise. The reason I say this is because I have multiple tattoos that are visible.</br></br>We all do come across difficult times in our lives and we all do have different ways of dealing with them. I do appreciate what your intentions are and am grateful to see that there is those good-hearted type of individuals that would give a moment of your time to hear us out. I thank you.</br></br>You specified that you’re a part of a team at UCI collecting stories about what has been happening inside facilities during the COVID-19 pandemic. I do understand that this is not to build any sort of relationship or anything in that nature. This is just strictly business. But I would be interested in communicating beyond this letter. But hey, only time will tell.</br></br>During this time of the COVID-19 pandemic life has been a little overwhelming. I’ve accounted two deaths in the family and a few more non-family members. So yes, it has been stressful. I’ve been constantly pursuing other coping mechanism instead of consuming drugs or alcohol to ease the grief. It is hard when that has been a go-to mechanism.</br></br>Every day is a struggle within these walls. The reducing of visitations from friends and loved owns has been difficult. Not been able to see your loved ones physically really tends to stress me out. Its hard knowing that your loved ones can catch this COVID-19 virus and result into death. Just the thought saddens me emotionally.</br></br>It’s only so much these letters could do to people. Me personally, I don’t receive mail. But I could just imagine during the pandemic it has been tough inside. But I always keep my head held high and stay positively motivated so I can get through this time and conclude my sentence on my prison term.</br></br>As of now I’ll cope by working out physically and mentally. Well, I appreciate you taking the time of day to read this letter. It was nice writing you even if this is the only letter. Thank you and enjoy your day.</br></br>
