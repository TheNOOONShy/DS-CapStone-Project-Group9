Dear PrisonPandemic, greetings,</br></br>

I sincerely hope your staff, family, friends, community and the entire world are in great health, especially during this pandemic. Your letter is very welcomed. I did not know CDCR had a public list and a website with my name on it, wow. Now I know!</br></br>

What is like to be inside at this time? While it’s never a good feeling to be inside at anytime, the pandemic only intensifies being in prison for me and my family. I received two Moderna vaccines, one on February 5th, 2021, the other on March 5th, 2021. While I’m delighted to have received the vaccines, my heart pains for the countless millions that have not.</br></br>

In the beginning of this horrible pandemic, I was amazed and astounded about what I was hearing on the news. I mean “what the hell,” “China did what,” “is this for real?” I did not want accept what I was hearing, but it’s on the news and it seemed to be real, and it is. I’m like, I’m already in prison, wrongly convicted, incarcerated 27 years, two and half in jail before incarceration and now this!</br></br>

I’m concerned about my family, nephews, nieces, relatives and the people of America humanity, especially the children of the world. My God we need you now! I hoped this COVID-19 pandemic would be a short experience, you know, something that won’t last long. Boy oh boy, that hope was diminished.</br></br>

As news tells it, this monster is real and has proven to have lasting, staying power. Officers in prison, but not all, would not wear their mask, irregular uses of COVID protocols, information of warnings. Officers and staff were spreading the virus to prisoners and officer staff. It was shocking, unbelievable, and alarming.</br></br>

Incarcerated human beings, trapped in a cage of metal and cement with officers spreading COVID-19, which is literally killing people inside. A sort of death certificate and I was not charged murder. Imagine that, seeing news reports of grandmothers, grandfathers, older people suffering, trying to survive, breathes; families in painful despair, grief, horror, agonizing.</br></br>
 
Hurt is not something people should have to bear, it’s not fair. My empathy is for those suffering and those who cost their lives is unrelenting, yet I’m the one in this god forsaken, inhumane cage. I have a deep, deep need to aide in others’ pandemic crisis.</br></br>

Also, much, much respect to all the frontline nurses and others, it’s absolutely amazing, wow! I have been recharged with hope. I do feel then though, what magnificent sacrifice, words are lost for what my heart feels. It’s not easy, it’s heroic by any imagination. Award shows such as Oscars, Emmys, and Tony Awards can’t express what these frontline human beings do, have done, and continue to do for us.</br></br>

A humanity, as Americans, I drown in my appreciation for those who have continued to put their lives on the line for us all. These human beings bravely and courageously face danger and the danger is invisible, imagine that!</br></br>

Also, the science community and their response to this COVID-19 has been a God-send, miraculous to say the least. Isn’t that something? Their discovery of vaccines is greater than the Mars landing, with all its cosmos. These vaccines are saving lives.</br></br>

All businesses shutdown, American economy shattered, lines of starving Americans imminent I seen it coming because everything and everyone are connected. It’s the snowball effect, regardless of position, status quo, race, rich or poor, a disease is not respecter of persons. The sooner we all realize that the better, right?</br></br>

In the beginning, many Americans did not exhibit what mature-minded adults demonstrate in such a serious crisis as this pandemic. Americans are still divided about our American experts state about this pandemic crisis, which is understandable. However, all the deaths in this pandemic is apparent, make no mistake about it.</br></br>

I’ve learned in life that, sometimes a very serious situation can bring about unity, love, and forgiveness. Sometimes, when we experience a very horrific situation, there’s a diamond in the rough. That diamond is how people start and do amend relationships. We learn to value life better, treasure each other, let bygones be bygones.</br></br>

It’s hard to witness prisoners suffer for visits from loved ones, family matters, all lives matters. I figure there are many people in the society in far worse situations than me. People living in the streets, homeless families, hunger, no medical attention, no clothes, showers and toiletries. It could be better and it could be worse.</br></br> 

Poor people and people of color in worse situations when their situation was already dire and bleak. COVID-19 is just a national crisis. Regardless, some prisoners, officers and staff skeptical of receiving the vaccines, for good reasons.</br></br> 

A history would have it, those few in authority in CDC and CDCR have proven to be untrustworthy and specifically when it comes to diseases, using Blacks as guinea pigs when it come to syphilis, a very infectious venereal disease. American or Amerikkka has a long and intense history of racism, torture and regarding Blacks and people of color as property, less than human, second- and third-class citizens, “just look around us.”</br></br> 

George Floyd and Chauvin case, America or the racist authorities, people figures of American or as Americans target Blacks, harass, misuse Blacks through ongoing, disparate treatment, systematic, disproportionate treatment on all levels. Even during the pandemic, news reports, PBS, and history tells us, Blacks aren’t being treated fairly as to vaccine distribution and Black Lives Matter, but only at the bottom of the totem pole.</br></br>

You asked “what has it been like to be inside during this time?” Being Black inside in American at a whole is a pandemic, a COVID 1-100 pandemic. As I see it, I was born a slave and the slave ship is called Amerikkka, right along with the Nina, the Pinta, and Santa Maria. If your professor is worth her weight in historical integrity, then she knows what I’m talking about.</br></br> 

The real pandemic is not COVID-19, it’s and American brainwashing through media on all levels. It will take the net of God Almighty to cure this mental, systematic pandemic we face in our Amerikkka. What has it been like inside? In a phrase, “CDCR-systematic hell,” to say the least. Like General Custer’s last standing; David, and Goliath, but David has no spiritual support; Noah’s Ark and if you have the vaccine, you have a space on the ship.</br></br>

Inside has allowed me to contemplate deeply about who, what, why, and when I am, my purpose, people’s purpose, and the human purpose of man and human kind. I find being human being is my true value. The who, what, why, when and anywhere I am, going to Mars, won’t change that. This pandemic won’t change that!</br></br>

Human being is the worth for me, moral values define me and my purpose in life, moved principles in a balancing application, to manage me first. I’ve learned that I’m like a “Sponge Bob,” a human sponge that must be very careful of what media, environmental influences, material or other things I’m being soaked in, because I’m affected on both a conscious and unconscious level.</br></br>

As I see it, the pandemic is both a blessing and a curse that has always been a part of the human experience, a type of shock therapy and a dose of medicine. People need to wake up to the reality that we are all on Noah’s ship together, and the ocean waves get really tough sometimes. It’s scary, it’s tough, and some of us will need a hug to make it through, but let’s ride this ship of rough waters together through it all.</br></br>

We must understand that people respond different to the ride on Noah’s Ark, some have the mental training of the captain, many don’t; some are front line passengers and most aren’t. Scared or brave, nervous, confident, the captain experience in us and guiding us will see us through. The cup is half full, not half empty! Waters are rough, we’ll make it.</br></br>

Prison, pandemic, whatever, like history, dictates we as humans will face this storm of pandemic adversity, just now is the responsibility of each person. The beginning of this pandemic is like most beginnings in my mind. An unknown, invisible enemy that must be investigated. Once realized, we must examine its possibilities, why, where it comes from, its origin to locate the root of its existence.</br></br> 

Then we must allow the best of humanity to come together, decide what must be done and how to deal with it. Then those trusted are now allowed to take the necessary steps to address the situation from every angle. We must trust those who we have entrusted with their position to best advise humanity.</br></br> 

As to the threat, risk and dangers we face and those in the position will, must and confidently will drive the bio of American pioneers in the direction we must go, the road we must travel to deliver Americans through the road of pandemic travel. It’s a rough road, a narrow road, with pot tables, dirt, and cliffs on the side of the road. Yet, American captains, drivers, pilots, and others in spiritual leadership have take experience, confidence, and training to guide us through this Katrina storm of adversity, this polio and epilepsy pandemic.</br></br>

Must be uppermost in spirit through all wars when Pearl Harbor Strikes and societal racism. The message will be, and must be sent to the people in prison, in America, and all around the world. Death will not prevent our pursuit to be rid of this pandemic called or named COVID-19. True American crusaders just aren’t built like that!</br></br>

People incarcerated inside, be it CDCR staff or those incarcerated  will take the knee off George Floyd’s neck, even when the knee is called COVID-19. We will breathe, we have come together with three verdicts and COVID-19 is the guilty party. It hasn’t killed us all.</br></br>

Moment will pass to the memories of history, and morals will be a reminder to us all, to harmonize, that humanity is stronger with a history of victories through all pandemics. Sometimes those victories are won in a short span of time and sometimes in a long span of time. We have many future victories yet to come. But we will meet them in generations to come.</br></br>

I’ve written much in this address to the question you stated in your letter, “what has it been like to been inside during this time at the beginning of the pandemic?” I could write more as to family and its experts, but it's at a later date.</br></br>

This is my attempt to address you question and until you respond. I hope the above verbals depicting my view is not too confusing. It’s 3:00 am to 4:34 am or more. Here’s some thoughts to leave you with.</br></br>

One, “What’s a diamond with no value?” Two, “A person is worth its morality.” Three, “Let’s explore the universe of good. ”Four, “Please do what’s best always."</br></br>

“Life” before you are overcome by “death.”</br></br>

“Health” before you are overcome by sickness.”</br></br>

“Youth before you are overcome by old age.”</br></br>

“Time before you are overcome by occupation.”</br></br>

“Wealth before you are overcome by poverty.”</br></br>

Thank you for your letter. I will do my best to accommodate your other request.</br></br>

Sincerely,</br></br>

Note: "Why hate, when love is available.”</br></br>

Have a great day!
