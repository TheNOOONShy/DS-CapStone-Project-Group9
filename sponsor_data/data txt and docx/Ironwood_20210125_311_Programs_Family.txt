Most prison programming got shut down.</br></br> 

For someone, like myself, who was very active in positive programing, was very discouraging to have my routine thwarted. Not to mention, disheartening to have the visits cancel. For me, it was not only difficult not to see my parents but scary. My parents are elderly and I worry for them. As well as my family and friends at home. Moreover, I worried for my own safety. The COVID is an unseen enemy, and it's frightening to not know when or from where it will strike.
