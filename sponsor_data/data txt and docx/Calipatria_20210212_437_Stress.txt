This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Calipatria.</br></br>
Not being able to be in the company of my family really put a strain on me. Being in the cell literally all day only goes way to think and stress so you really have to block out all the worry some and stressful thoughts because it will drive you mad. I’ve been keeping myself busy Monday-Friday by working out, reading, and writing to my family, it really helps me cope with what is really going on around me.</br></br>

I’ve been doing lots of self-analyzing looking at my life and things I’ve been through and what I truly want for myself beyond these walls. Things was I once into at one point in time are no longer attractive to me anymore. It’s as if the lifestyle I gave my life to is beginning to recede. Over the years I’ve learned that I cannot alter external things nor shape people to my liking or mold the world to my wishes, but one thing for sure that I can alter is the internal things in my life, my desires, passions, and my thoughts, to look at my situation from another perception.</br></br>

I believe that I am and all that I’ve been through is building to my character, I feel as a progressive and ever evolving being you are where are at in life so that you may learn and grow. After you endure the endurable you will be able and ready to take on difficult tasks and life lessons that the world has to offer.</br></br>

Just prior to my celly receiving your letter I was pouring the water to flush the toilet and I told my celly “No one knows what we are going through in here nor do they care” and I was wrong so again thank you for your letter you all are good people. I appreciate you in the highest fashion and look forward to hearing back from you guys if possible.</br></br>

With respect and best wishes.
