I found stability and have been involved in numerous self-help courses chosen to cope with challenges responsibly and address those serious issues that have plagued me since adolescence. The CDCR acknowledged my progress by transferring me to a prison with plenty of rehabilitative programs. Working in a sewing factory, participating in self-help groups and finally going to college (it only took 23 years to make it to class). This is the scenario that I was in last March when COVID came calling.  We made it through 9 months without an active case on our yard. The news kept me both informed and anxious, while the world rapidly reacted to this uniquely treacherous virus. Our activities and movements were sustained systematically, we wore masks and were never outside by ourselves and we waited. Other prisons like San Quentin were disaster areas and staff scoffed at the precautionary rules such as mandatory masks. There were a ton of close calls, we were placed on lockdown, tested with long torturous Q-tips up our noses but released when all was clear.
<br><br> 
Then on November 22nd we were recalled for more critical work assignments, important jobs which are never canceled and the rumors and trepidation spread. Our prison commissary supervisor was taken out of the prison infected with COVID! The entire prison was locked down and everyone was tested. We were kept in the dark, staff played the situation up yet again to adhere to all the precautions! We spent the next four months being tested every 4 days and watching guys who are positive get taken away to quarantine areas. At first, it was something of a jokeâ€¦ then, it became scary because people came down with the symptoms such as loss of taste, headaches and etc. this came with more tests, name is being called over and over on a PA system, guys leaving it was like Schindler's list! 
<br><br> 
People refusing the test to avoid being carried away to some unknown and horrible area of the infected patients! Paranoia set in, convicts stayed in their cells and were afraid to use the internet at all; some used used humor and it insisted it was the government or China that started the virus others made sense of the facts and hunker down in place planned on riding it out in their cells, and not in gymnasiums like the zombie movies!

Throughout November to March of 21 we were kept on lockdown and not giving much info. Many guys returned from quarantine areas with outrageous stories of no medical assistance  just warehouses of bodies. Others said they had become extremely weak, sick and fearful. A few never returned out of my co-workers whom I helped pack to go to the quarantine. They died of COVID. In retrospect, CDCR didn't prevent us from getting exposed; they simply managed the rate at which we became infected in order to prevent their medical staff from being overwhelmed. 
<br><br> 
By February/March 21 most of us were exposed or infected and the population reached herd immunity next, everyone was given vaccines.  Now our programs, activities and movement are solely returning. I became sick for 10 days in early February and stayed in the comfort of my familiar cell. There were days when I was fearful about my loss of appetite, smell, taste which lasted close to two weeks. Being sequestered helped my ability to stay calm though really.

The build-up was way worse than the sickness and the vaccine side effects were substantial. Moving forward throughout the pandemic guys are also experiencing respiratory problems.. I have little support and no visitors, so COVID hasn't impacted me on that front. This is the true reason I'm ecstatic about your correspondence.
