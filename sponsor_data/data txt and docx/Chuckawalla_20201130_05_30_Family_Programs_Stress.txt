This story was told by a person incarcerated at Chuckawalla.</br></br>

UCI: And how has the COVID-19 at your facility affected your loved ones?</br></br>

Caller: Honestly, my family and my emergency contact had no idea about any of this until finally I was able to make a phone call myself. And between not having access to a phone for a couple days, and then being too sick to even get off my bed for a couple more days after that.</br></br>

None of my family knew for at least five days that I was sick. And I know inmates that had pneumonia and were in the hospital inches away from death, and their family still didn’t know until they came back and personally called their family.</br></br>

Their family was calling the prison, they said, “Oh he’s fine.” Well, meanwhile, he was actually in the hospital. They’re just trying to keep this under wraps as much as possible.</br></br>

UCI: And what has it been like for you to have reduced visitation and programming?</br></br>

Caller: Oh my god. If it weren’t for being able to do college out of, you know, through proctors right now, I would be absolutely nuts. You know that’s the only thing we have right now. And that's the few of us who are already enrolled in college that are doing that. The rest of these guys are, you know, we’re like a pressure cooker ready to explode with frustration.</br></br>

UCI: How have you been coping with the crisis?</br></br>

Caller: I could probably do better. I mean, I already have anger and control issues as it is. And this whole experience, this whole year has been unbelievable. Like, I don't even think I have words to describe how frustrating it’s been.</br></br> 

UCI: It sounds like it's not going very well and I’m sorry that you’re going through that right now.</br></br> 

Caller: Well, thank you. We appreciate that you guys are doing this for us. It’s nice to know finally that people like you helping us, are helping us give a voice to truly how corrupt it is in here.</br></br> 

UCI: What else would you like people to know about your experience?</br></br>

Caller: Just that when they call these prisons and the staff members are telling them that it's not as bad as we make it out to seem, that honestly it's the other way around. That it is the way it is that when we call home and we say, “It's like this”.</br></br> 

They don’t take it serious, they treat us like we’re the problem when they’re the ones contracting the virus. And all they do is, when they come to work they get their temperature checked and they get asked a survey. And then they come in here and they contaminate us and they expose us to this and they make our lives a living hell because of their incompetence.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah. I’m sorry that’s a really frustrating situation.
