UCI: What's it been like for you to have the reduced visitation and programming?</br></br>Caller: Oh, yeah, we - we have nothing going on right now. I mean, basically - because I'm in education, we're having none of that going on.</br></br>As far as our medical goes, as far as dental, glasses, anything like that, forget about any of that because that's not happening. No medical really so to speak of except for outside medical. And that's an emergency. That's about it. And we're getting our yard. That's a good thing. We still get a little bit of yard, we still get our canteen, all our packages and stuff like that, but it's still - it - they still don't follow the rules, rules, rules.
