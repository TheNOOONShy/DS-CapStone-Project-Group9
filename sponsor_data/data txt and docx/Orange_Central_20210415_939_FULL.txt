Dear PrisonPandemic,</br></br>

I am so honored to receive your letter. It touched my heart. Thank you for your concern. Thank you for thinking of me. Thank you for believing in me that “I got what it takes to get through it” (sometimes I feel that I don’t). Thank you for this opportunity and most of all thank you so much for this piece of mail. I needed it.</br></br>

First off it is very nice to meet you. What kindhearted souls you and your classmates are to conduct this type of study. I would love to help in anyway I can. I think I have a few stories I can share with you. I’ve been wanting to do something special for the UCI Medical Center and this just might be it.</br></br>

Secondly, I want to express the power of your mail for us jail birds. Since the start of the pandemic and the closing of visiting us inmates shifted all hope of communication to the USPS. We all hope and pray each day for a piece of mail. The deputy’s pass out the mail at 3 pm each day and it is a time of hope and joy throughout the facility.</br></br> 

So bless you UC Irvine for reaching out during this pandemic and giving me/us some joy. Mail is gold around here and you made me rich.</br></br>

In the month of January I caught COVID-19. Not only did I catch it but every man in the sector got sick. I was so sick I couldn’t breathe. It was scary.</br></br> 

In the middle of the night I pushed the emergency button in my cell. Immediately a deputy came over the intercom and asked “What is your medical emergency?” “I can’t breathe.” I pleaded.</br></br> 

The deputy popped my door open and I weakly made my way down the stairs to sit in the day room. The nurse took my pulse oxy and seen it was only at 81 percent. They hooked me to oxygen and called 911. Twenty minutes later I was in UCI Medical.</br></br>

I was terrified. This was my first time in a hospital. I was an inmate and alone. But UCI Medical made me feel at ease.</br></br> 

They took good care of me. I was given antiviral medication, steroids, oxygen, and a lot of love. The medical staff were so brave. I tear up as I write this, thinking of their bravery.</br></br> 

The food was so good. After eating nothing but cold sandwiches for several months at the jail, it was wonderful to eat three hot meals a day for the six days I spent in the hospital.</br></br> 

A million thanks would not be even enough to thank UCI Medical for restoring me to health. The doctors and nurses worked tirelessly, around the clock, to help me. Even though I was an inmate UCI treated me like a human being.</br></br> 

Not only was I treated like a human being but UCI Medical risked their lives to save mine. From the cooks who work the kitchen to the doctors who saved my life, thank you. I love you. God bless you.</br></br>

Thank you so much for this opportunity and as I have written already your mail. Please don’t stop this correspondence program, for it is life giving. Feel free to reach out to me anytime.</br></br>

With all due love and respect.
