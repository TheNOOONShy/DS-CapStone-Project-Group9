This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Merced USP Atwater Federal Center.</br></br>

After one week in [redacted] I was transferred again, this time to Victorville, CA USP for another quarantine/holdover. I got stuck for two months ‘cause I took the COVID vaccine Moderna. I got really sick from both shots (SMH).</br></br>

30 minutes out of the cell for shower or phone every other day as well. This was when I finally lost a family member to COVID and almost lost my mother as well. She pulled through though pneumonia had only affected one of her lungs. Thank God.</br></br> 

It’s just unpredictable when COVID’s going to hit home. It’s really mentally fucked up. ‘Specially when you have nobody to talk to or nobody writes ‘cause you just become out of sight out of mind to the world.</br></br>

Finally I was transferred to my final destination here in Atwater, CA USP. Finally no more holdovers. No more transfers. Now I can start programming to go home sooner than later. I took a total of 14 months just to get where I am at.</br></br>

So now that I’ve been in general population for a month I am definitely treated differently. I can make all the calls I need. I am not free yet but I am thankful to talk to family more. All in all you never know how strong you are until being strong is the only choice you have.
