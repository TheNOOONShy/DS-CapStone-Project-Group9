This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Wasco.</br></br>

First I don’t know who I’m writing to the address says [redacted] but at the end of the letter it says Best Wishes from [redacted]. So either or thanks for writing me. I didn’t know what to expect because the address wasn’t familiar. First I find your project interesting so I don’t mind telling you about my experiences. I don’t know where to exactly start so Ima just kick it off right here. But Just keep in mind my spelling and grammar isn’t kin like yours or at college level also my lingo isn't college level so bear with me.</br></br>

So about a year and some change ago I heard about this virus I didn’t think nothing of it. But as months extended it seemed pretty serious they stopped program no phone calls, less action on going to yard because just from one day to the next everything changed. I keep up with it on the news.</br></br> 

As I was watching TV from my cell which is a pretty far distance from my door looking from the window the news was saying everything is shutting down people are stocking up on toilet paper, canned foods, disinfectant. I sat back and though shit this is real serious. People stealing, people robbing, people getting hurt.</br></br> 

It was crazy, I had to call my people. Keep in mind I can't just call at any time I have to wait until its my day for phone calls. As I was on the phone I asked my people whats going on out there. They gave me the whole rundown I said to myself “Damn shit just got real.”</br></br> 

Okay now you asked me what has it been like to be inside at this time. Well its a trip because first your wondering if your family's okay, if they have all the supplies they need because from the new’s they say its hard to get supplies, if there not in stalk the prices are higher and to think your people can get layed off at any day.</br></br> 

Your people get jacked, your people may get COVID and die also. You’re in jail so you can’t see them before they do die but God forbid that happens. Not being able to pay the bills.</br></br> 

Shit you don't even want to ask for money because you think they may need it more shit I cant even imagine if I had kids man thats something I cant imagine because I don't have kids so think about all that and trip out because your sitting in a six by ten cell and there’s nothing you can do or know that your people are safe and sound.</br></br> 

It gets bad to where you cant sleep at night because your thinking about your family, friends, people who don't have a place to go or eat. People that you hope think about you now and then people that you love, homie’s that are from your hood. I had plenty of days where I didn't want to eat, sleep, or even get out bed and Im they type of prisoner that programs at 5-5:30am and sleep around 10 or 11:00 the latest.</br></br> 

It gets hard to read I know everyone has times where your reading a book but you’re not comprehending what you’re reading. I like to read alot of self help books and history book’s well anything to stimulate my mind and you now you have to go back and reread that book.</br></br> 

Its even hard to find someone to write or talk to because people out there are worried about the same thing you're worried about. It sucks when you all of a sudden don't get any pictures or letters because everyone in the street or more worried about not catching COVID or worried about bills and other family matters so it sucks if you’re in my shoes because to tell you the truth it made me happy to get this letter because it shows someone cares because prisons reduced visiting.</br></br> 

But at the same time our people don't have the time to visit us because they don't wanna catch COVID and give it their family or they’re out trying to earn that dollar to buy supplies they need so yeah its a bitch.</br></br>

And you get people around you freaking out which makes you freak out a bit. Your celly may have bad news so you want to listen to show him there’s someone that cares.</br></br>

Im one of the people that had COVID in jail it sucks because these CO’s (Correctional Officer) don't want to get closer to you because they’re not trying to get it at the same time spread it so program and visitation gets cut more so there’s less action to get in touch with your people and you don't wanna tell your family either because you don't want them to worry about you knowing they got everyone in the streets to worry about so yeah I gets pretty hectic.</br></br>

I'm not gonna get into details on how bad I got COVID but it was pretty bad and just know we don't get the treatment like in a hospital so everyone in the streets have it pretty good I know some might say well we put ourself in here. Yeah you’re right but man we’re not trying to die knowing some of us have a release date to go home.</br></br>

You also ask what I feel about my safety well Ima say I have no safety concerns but people get stabbed beat up almost everyday so its kind of normal in prison so Ill be more worried about the prison lifestyle then getting COVID so safety concerns are good nothing to be worried about so everything is a trip.</br></br>

It sucks but its bearable. I just hope to meet someone and enjoy their company so if anyone is there that wouldn’t mind to write a prisoner please feel free to write so I can enjoy their company and vice versa.</br></br> 

Thanks for all your wishes and it feels good to get a letter though these times you really helped out a lot and I hope I helped out on your project as well so best believe I enjoyed your company and I hope you have a Blessed day and remember always keep your head up and middle fingered to the sky.</br></br>

Sincerely.</br></br>

P.S. I’ll Send a drawing but I don't know who its going to so give me a name for the next letter.
