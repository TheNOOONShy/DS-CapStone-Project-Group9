Hope when you get this letter it finds you in the best of health and good spirits! My name is [redacted]. Something you already know. My birthday is [redacted] 1990 born and raised in the city of Long Beach CA. I been incarcerated since 2018 and will be till February 2023. Hopefully I will be home sooner.</br></br>

All my charges I ever been to jail for are guns, sales and transportations of sales. I知 on general population which means I知 not around child molesters, rapist or anybody with a sex crime that harms kids. So basically I知 not a weirdo! LOL.</br></br>

I been in and out of jail since I was 13th, but this is my longest jail time I知 serving right now and COVID is not making it any better. There was an outbreak in this prison so I did catch COVID-19. I am vaccinated now.</br></br>

When I was sick with COVID I was sick bad with all the symptoms. Being away from my loved ones while sick with this virus being deadly as it is was scary. I really don稚 know what else to say but get back at me in details what exactly more you need that can help. And I will be more than happy to help you.</br></br>

Thanks for giving me the chance to help you. Hope to hear from you soon.</br></br>

Sincerely.
