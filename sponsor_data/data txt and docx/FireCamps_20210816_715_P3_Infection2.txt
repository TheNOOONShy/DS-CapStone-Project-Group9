This story was told by a person incarcerated at Fire Camp.</br></br>  

Caller: The guy, who got into put into our transpac van on July the 22nd, 2021, where myself and five other inmates were transpac'd from Jamestown Sierra Conservation Center to Holton facility all the way in Los Angeles, seven hours away, and we made two stops in public and contaminated the entire rest stop and the entire Shell Station, was fully vaccinated.</br></br> 

Let me say that one more time. The guy was fully vaccinated. So, my question is this. If the vaccinations work, and believe me, I was asking everybody with a badge, especially if they have some stripes, if he was fully vaccinated and the vaccinations work, then why are you quarantining us, and why did you turn the van around?</br></br> 

So either A, you're upselling a product that you know does not work, or B, you're just completely incompetent. Which one is it? And they had no answers. So, I'm just gonna explain that real quick one more time.</br></br> 

UCI: Sure.</br></br> 

Caller: We were in the van with someone who was fully vaccinated, yet they felt the need to bring us all the way back seven hours after we had been exposing the public to the Delta variant potentially, even though the person who was exposed directly to the COVID was completely vaccinated.</br></br> 

UCI: Completely vaccinated.</br></br> 

Caller: Which, my opinion -- which, whatever that really means. Because once again, my question to the medical staff is,well why would I take a vaccination shot -- well I said, what about the people who took the vaccination in say, February or March or even January, if the new Delta variant is the one that's killing all these people? What good is a shot gonna do, that was created before the strain that's killing everybody?</br></br> 

UCI: Yeah, absolutely. Fair point. Jesus Christ.</br></br> 

Caller: Where's the logic? And CDCR staff, and I'm talking about sergeants, captains, and lieutenants because I constantly climb up that command ladder. I climb up that ladder on a regular basis to make sure that I'm getting their most -- well, supposed to be their--</br></br> 

UCI: Senior officer?</br></br> 

Caller: The highest-paid is the most familiar with the protocols. None of them have any answers.
