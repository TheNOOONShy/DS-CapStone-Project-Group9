This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Jamestown.</br></br>To whom it may concern,</br></br>I am an inmate at Sierra Conservation Center level two. I have been incarcerated since 2009. I received this letter from PrisonPandemic project and I want to reply and let people know what a blessing it is to be free and with their loved ones in this hard times of the pandemic.</br></br> 

Our world has been turned upside down, but I hope that people can open their eyes and don’t take the little things in life for granted. Because you don’t know what you have 'til it’s gone.</br></br> This COVID has affected me in a profound way. I have lost relationships and the opportunity to see my family and hug them and spend quality time with them. I can honestly say this has been the hardest time for me in my 13 years of incarceration. However, I stay strong and positive, hopeful that this will end soon.</br></br> 

I cope with this situation by my faith in God. I put all my fear, worries and my life in his hands because he is the creator and has the whole universe in his hands.</br></br>I also work-out, read, draw and educate myself through college courses to get my mind off the negativities that’s going around the world. I would love to hear from anyone from PrisonPandemic project that can write and can be a support in these hard times. Thank you for your time.</br></br>  

May God bless you.</br></br>Sincerely.
