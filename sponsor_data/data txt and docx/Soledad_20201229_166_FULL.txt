This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Soledad.</br></br>

To a student at UCIRVINE PRISON PANDEMIC:</br></br>
Hello my name is [redacted] a once freed life term inmate in 2017 by a Commissioner former Warden of yes you guessed it C.T.F Soledad.I am incarcerated once again on a Penal Code [redacted] and a title [redacted] department of corrections disciplinary manual that supercedes any law in the U.S. constitution. The C.D.C.R. And the B.P.H. have their own code of ethics.I was found considered to be no longer a danger to society by this Commissioner and a deputy Commissioner in 2017.</br></br>
Well let me start by saying I have had 5# covid-19 tests since Oct. 20th 2020. I am now covid-19 positive. I am an asthmatic and use albuterol rescue inhaler and just started an asthma medication a.k.a Montelukast, another medication for a sever cough called Benzonatate. As of Dec. 24th Christmas Eve 2020 in the surrounding counties around Monterrey here are the statistics of the dead and these Covid-19 positive and in some the hospitals’ ICU. FOX35 #2channel 3 news app.KCBA channel #35 and channel #3.</br></br>
Monterrey and marin county (182) (136) dead. 24,932 covid-19 positive. (san francisco 21,000 + 178 dead, solano 17,300 + 95 dead, san mateo 22,241 + 212 dead, alameda 28,000 + 619 dead, lake county 2 23 dead Mendocino-Sonoma counties (26) (810 dead, 17,444 covid positive. Contra Costa - 308 dead covid positive unknown Napa - 36 dead: 5,021 covid-19 positive Santa Clara - #632 dead: 59,000 covid-19 positive, Santa Cruz - 100 # dead covid19 positive unknown.</br></br>
I was taken to the Central part of the prison to a place a.k.a. [Redacted]-wing also over-flow for the sick and recovering from outside hospital visits or operations. Also infamously known on television as the infirmary. THE VISUALIZATION OF AN INFIRMARY ON T.V. IS VERY CLOSE TO EXACT. (make a mental note call O.S.H.A).</br></br>
It is unusually a requirement to stay there to re-couperate after a outside visit to a hospital and sometime you don’t
get better like I am feeling. Y-Wing is a shoddy re-vamped prison 3 tier unit made of single man prison cells cold as hell and full of sick inmates because of this Covid-19 outbreak. Pardon the prison comedy smart assed rhetorics but sometimes it’s the best medicine when I think my circumstances may not change soon enough. Y-wing was where I was taken in Oct. 2020. I complained of co-vid19 symptoms and waited from 12:00 noon until 1:30 shift change for correctional officers 3rd watch a.k.a.</br></br>I walked over to Central TTA (trauma medical for the whole prison). Nowadays we get carted off in an ambulance. Why not when sick ask for a fu$$ing ride. Prison!. These inmates and thier ingueinuity lets me know, sometimes take a shortcut. It’s Christmas Eve the ambulance has been to B-yard Whitney Buld, once but has been on B-yard 25 times at least.</br></br> 

I was in Y-Wing 10 days and my symptoms ‘I thought’ got worse as my time lengthened at Central Y-Wing. After 2 days I developed a psycho-symatic syndrome of cold chills up the spine and a cough and seemed to stay with me after the correctional staff and medival personnel came passing by. I went through vital checks (blood pressure checks, temperature chks. Mouth thermometer. I got sick, even though I had been cleared from [redacted]-Wing in Nov. or somewhere around there?? By Nov. 20th through Dec. 20th 800 inmates and correctional staff became infected & 7 died.</br></br>

When I got back from Central Y-Wing (make-shift infirmary) I received a C.D.O custodial warning from a correctional officer (a non-adverse 115) for not showing to my p.m. kitchen cook assignment. Now try to visualize a sickness (global) that sure as shit infected Central facility as well as the main kitchen I know this for a fact because our back docks that we un-load food for our morning & evening meals looks directly at the loading dock of Central kitchen. It had served us food for at least 3 months before anything was mentioned to us cooks that thier part of the prison had multiple inmates as well as staff covid-19 positive.</br></br>
I am now covid-19 positive and quarantine to my cell 500 miles from riverside Calif. where I reside in the town/city of Moreno Valley Calif. I told on one of the free staff correctional cooks for not wearing a mask and when asked by a medical technician who did I come in contact with (after I was given a covid-19 test, I fired off another accusation at a correctional officer directly associated with the prison kitchen supervision of us inmate cooks explaining I was not offered a chance to submit/volunteer my nostrils for covid-19 symptoms. I knew that I felt sick but this prison and San Quentin are notorious for asbestos fibers/mold spores and noro viruses it’s also flu season and I become ill after recieving a flu vaccination.</br></br> 

San Quentin had an outbreak of legionnaires disease located in the air vents since the time of Gerry Brown our former Governor of Calif around 2016 and before that I heard Arnold Schwartzenagger was trying to close San Quentin and possibly auction off the land. That would be very nice real estate development land it is located right next to the San Francisco Bay. The next prison on the most recent Govenor’s agenda to possibly close is this one here C.T.F. Soledad.</br></br>       
So you ask how am I holding up in this Prison Pandemic? I feel shaky sick and I thank you dearly for your gracious letter I recieved it on Christmas Eve. You must be an Angel of somekind. Well, it seems the Womens Prison and Vacaville Medical Facility and Stockton medical facility have gotten the green light for the vaccine.</br></br>The scary thing about these older prison San Quentin and Soledad (1920’s & 1946) are only habitable when O.S.H.A doesn’t point the finger of liability at the toxicity at the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitations.I cannot name one prison correctional officer that has drank the prison’s water supply while working at the prison grounds for the years or months’ time that they have had to work in the prisons. Masks, gloves and gowns are now worn on B-facility 2 months ago Oct. 2020 Central facility (where I just came back from sick and had to give a F.A.D.(forensic assessment division) interview for possibility rate for recidivism for lifeterm inmates. My B.P.H. had scheduled for July 2020 and was put on hold for Feb. 2021.</br></br>
I am on a yearly annual B.P.H. [redacted]. I am passed my hearing legal limit date according to the title15 and CCRtitle15. This hearing should have had happen 6 months ago. (2275(c) 2275(d) of CCRtitle15 was not considered and I had to stay here during the surge of covid19 sick and ead of this pandemic now I am sick with covid19 and I do have underlying medical conditions. Face shields, blue gowns and gloves are on every prison official and when I have my F.A.D. interview (via-sattelite) I was wearing a face shield. Mental note (call O.S.H.A.).</br></br>
SOMETIMES, I wonder when I am given something unbelievable like a lower bunk accommodation ‘what’ I am going to have to give back in re-turn. I stroll up to the cell and it is occupied by a hispanic man a little younger than myself and come to find out that we both had the same previous cellmate whom was sick form symptoms a.k.a. Malaria.</br></br>So we both got a double dose of this virus as well as the malaria. I couldn’t hide my expression. When I moved in with the man that had the original malaria virus he told me, “I have had malaria and now I am on Hydroxy-chlorquine I had just previously watch our now out going President Donald J. Trump name off a possible cure for the now contagious Covid-19. I wish I had a prescription! All this is a true story. The other young hispanic man [redacted], paroledearly non-violent crime. But we both probably have 2 viruses to deal with.</br></br> 

Thank you very much for acknowledging me and sending a ‘ just to show you we care post-card. Did you think I would pass on the oppertunity to go viral.</br></br>
With all my respect and admiration to the people at PRISON PANDEMIC.</br></br>
Thank you for the letter Sincerely: [redacted] Dec. 26, 2020.</br></br>
MERRY CHRISTMAS & HAPPY NEW YEAR!
