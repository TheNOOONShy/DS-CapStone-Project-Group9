This story was told by a person incarcerated at Ironwood.</br></br>

Caller: I wrote up 602 based on me catching COVID, COVID-19, was denied and the denial basically said, their denial to my 602 appeal was it was unknown how the inmate contracted COVID virus. Denial, and my argument was “I’m in your custody, you were lacking in providing us protective PPE, personal protective equipment [unintelligible] headache in the morning.</br></br> 

Right now my 602’s been in Sacramento since, I don’t know, a month and a half now. They denied it right away, every request for them to, you know, correct the errors just didn’t, basically just tossed around, being ignored like if we did something wrong. Well at least that’s the impression I got.
