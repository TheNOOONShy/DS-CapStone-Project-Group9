This story was told by a person incarcerated at Chino.</br></br>

UCI: So, what facility are you currently housed at?</br></br>

Caller: California Institution for Men.</br></br>

UCI: And what is the current COVID-19 situation at your facility?</br></br>

Caller: Pretty severe.</br></br>

UCI: Can you tell me a little bit more about that? How did things start off, and what are they like now?</br></br>

Caller: Okay, well they started off back in, I believe like in March, at the beginning of March with the stuff, with I guess a lot of stuff in the news going on. And in here they started, what did they start doing- they started like doing a little bit social distancing, trying, you know. We have in my facility here, there's four buildings, two floors each, and they started, like limiting the outdoor recreation, which is called yard.</br></br>

They limited it to two buildings at a time at the beginning. Education started cutting down a little bit. And then it started getting a little bit worse outside. So, they started implementing more restrictions inside, which they basically started, what did they do, they cancelled all outside programming.</br></br>

So, nobody from the outside was allowed to come in at all anymore cause we had like you know different programming for like, Cal State University, San Bernardino, and then also the education here. They started cancelling that, and then they switched back to packets, to everybody to do it in their housing so nobody will try to gather.</br></br> 

So, they started implementing a few different social distancing procedures here but not completely cause I think that I guess, it was all new to them. So, they didn't really follow through on a lot of things. And as it went along, months, weeks, came by then, we were doing good in this particular yard. There's four yards in this facility.</br></br>

This yard was, cause we are in cells, so there wasn't a lot of contact, but the other yards that had dormitories started to experience high COVID rates. We didn't have any at the beginning. So, what they did, they started moving, one of the buildings, they started making room at one of the floors so they could bring in the people from the other yards that were considered positives.</br></br>

And so, they could isolate more in the cell. It's basically rooms. So, they won't be in an open setting as a dorm. So, they were bringing people from other yards into our yard. And by doing that up I believe that's how it basically started spreading here. And then also the staff, you know. Sure.</br></br> 

So, few of them started testing and then basically it just kind of got crazy a little bit. We went through a first wave at probably the end of April and May. So, then we start getting the short wave. But then a few months ago, like about two months ago, I think September, we experienced another wave.</br></br>

Where each building holds 100 people per floor than one of our dormitories that I was in at least, like 85 percent in each floor that got COVID positive. They tested out everybody cause they were doing like random testing at first but everywhere they were testing started coming out positive.</br></br>

So, yeah, I'm sure I missed a few things in between. Like in March, going back to March, they stopped all the visitings too. So, everything was just over the phone, and stuff like that. So, it got kind of crazy.</br></br> 

Before they did that, I believe it started getting a little bit out of hand here, so they tested everybody. The people, from what I heard, the people that tested negative, they started shipping them out. They shipped out I believe 120-something people over to San Quentin from this facility.</br></br>

UCI: Do you remember when that was when they started moving people to San Quentin?</br></br>

Caller: I think it might have been like in October. I believe. I don't recall. I have a journal, that I could go back and look. But they started shipping a bunch of people supposedly to prevent them from getting contaminated, but the bad part is they did a test.</br></br> 

They tested everybody, and then they waited like two and a half weeks after the test. And then all the people that had come out negative are the ones who got shipped out, but they never really isolated everybody. They didn't do a full lockdown.</br></br>

So, everybody that got tested negative, at the time, you know, they were still interacting with the ones that were positive or with everybody. And so, that's what I believe. The news came out quite a bit about San Quentin that they got contaminated, that was because of the people that they took from here, because that facility didn't have any positives at the time.</br></br> 

And by bringing the people that were from here that they're already tested positive, I mean, they had tested negative, but they were already infected. And they took the infection over there and they got crazy but being that they're in Sacramento they got more publicity than we did.</br></br> 

But we were quite a few people. I think we were a lot higher than any other prison in the state from what I believe. But anyway. So, I jumped around a little bit, but that's basically about it. Is there any other particular questions you guys have and wanted to ask?</br></br>

UCI: Sure. So, what do you think would make the situation at your facility better?</br></br>

Caller: Well, it's getting better now. Like I said, they implemented a lot of things, but it was a big learning curve for them, I believe. Even their health services director got replaced because of the whole, anyways, yeah, that's recorded on our site.</br></br> 

And I mean, they're doing a lot of things, but I think they could have done a little bit more as far as locking everybody down completely. I don't think they had good coordination between custody staff and medical, because from what we would hear it's like, medical wanted one thing and then custody wanted something else.</br></br> 

And basically, they would test somebody, like I said, in this facility we have cells. And there's two people per cell, they tested everybody. If one person became infected they would take them and move them over to that isolation ward that they created when they emptied out one of the buildings and, but they left the other person in the cell without quarantine.</br></br> 

And that's something that we didn't really understand. So, we kind of ask the inmate themselves to do a self-quarantine, which most of them did but not everybody. So, I mean they were allowed to move around and it's like if they were in a cell with somebody that came up positive, I'm sure that they could hide it.</br></br> 

They just haven't shown any symptoms or shown that they were positive also. But anyways, as far as what they're doing, I mean, now I think they're doing a lot better. But it still doesn't make sense sometimes because, 'cause like now what they did they put a bunch of us in the gym, in a dormitory type of setting.</br></br> 

I guess to make room for the isolation ward, which makes sense, but, you know, it's just, who knows, cause it doesn't sound like even the people outside know exactly what's going on.</br></br>

UCI: And what is it, what is it been like for you to have reduced visitation and programming?</br></br>

Caller: Well, we don't have any visitations at all. As of March, there's no visitation at all. Programming is kind of a big learning curve for us cause I know we know we're in prison and kind of expecting certain things. But yeah, as far as the visitation there had been no visitations at all.</br></br> 

They just started about two weeks ago doing video conferencing. And that's barely that they have to start working out because I heard there were some problems with that. I haven't tried it out myself. But they get Nextel. They've been offering free phone calls twice a month.</br></br>

So, people will jump on that quite a bit. But it's kind of hard to not be able to see family members, like, for me, for myself I have an elderly father. He's in his upper 80s and, you know, I wouldn't want him to come anyways but if this doesn't get resolved then I don't get a chance to see him anymore.</br></br>

And that's why I'm actually calling because when I got the letters like, you don't think about things like that until somebody actually points it out. It's like, if this thing doesn't get under control, within a certain amount of time, then I might not get a chance to see him. I mean, I feel like it hurts but other than that it's just something that you've learned to live with, I believe.</br></br>

UCI: And how has the COVID-19 situation at your facility affected your, your father or your other loved ones?</br></br>

Caller: As far as outside family, nobody has gone infected. Other than in here, I'm the only one from my family that I know that has gotten infected. Everybody, he's like I said elderly but he's stubborn, just like a lot of other people's parents.</br></br>

He doesn't want to, he's tired of being inside so he tries to go outside to sneak out and family members tries to take him everything, so he won't. But it's affecting us quite a bit, but you know they're doing what they can I guess. He is the father and it's kind of hard to tell him what to do.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah. So, you said you tested positive. What was the quality of your care like when you were, when you were positive?</br></br>

Caller: Oh, it was, it was good. The quality before was kind of weird because like I said, I don't think that some of the nurses they brought in kind of knew what it was because we were all in one building. And they were doing random testing at first, and then as they tested positive they would move them to an isolation ward.</br></br>

And for us, they would come and once somebody tested, they would quarantine the building. So, we would have to stay in for two weeks to make sure nobody you know got any symptoms. So, what they were looking mostly was for symptoms, which was a fever, you know cough, and all that.</br></br>

And at the beginning, the first wave it's just like, not that many people. Like me, myself, the only symptom I had was like a light, mild headache, and runny nose. But everybody in the building caught I guess what everybody believed would be a cold.</br></br>

And anybody that has a symptom of fever or any type of other symptoms they would move them to isolation. So, a lot of people didn't want to move. So, a lot of people would kind of like, take medicine and you know wipe themselves down before you get tested and try to not show any symptoms at least while they were being tested.</br></br> 

But yeah. Besides, after that, like I said, when we got the second wave towards the end where everybody got sick. Then they came in and tested everybody in the whole building. And that's where, like I said, like over 85 percent.</br></br> 

So, like over 80 people on each floor came out positive. And they moved them all to an isolation ward. And the isolation ward was pretty good. I mean, the nurses will come in, we would get our vitals taken twice a day.</br></br> 

They gave us a lot of fluids. They tested our oxygen level, our blood pressure, and temperature, twice a day. Other than that, we're just, I mean, we are at prison. So, it's like we're in a tiny little room and we just could come out for 15 minutes to go take a shower, you know make a quick phone call and then we can head back into the cells.</br></br> 

I mean, that's expected because where we're at. But other than that, I mean, the care was pretty good. When we had it. Once the two weeks were up they just sent us back out and they're just waiting to see what else happens.</br></br>

UCI: When you were in isolation where you were by yourself in a cell or was it people all together who tested positive?</br></br>

Caller: There was two people. I'm sorry but my time is up.
