This story was told by a person incarcerated at OC Central.</br></br>

Caller: Well, we just started by getting the visiting which is a positive thing due to COVID. And the six foot distance being a big factor, visits were, had to be contained at a minimum level and at some point stopped. But now they've continued.</br></br>

That was a lot of the extracurricular programs that the jails have as well. But we be, we be supplied with masks. Free masks, you know, in maintaining the six foot distance on our appointments in our community through the jails.</br></br>

UCI: How has the, sorry?</br></br>

Caller: It’s something different, you know?</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, definitely.</br></br>

Caller: Not everything is clear up. They got the vaccines going. I got the Johnson Johnson, so I think the vaccines are like a cure for the COVID as well as other problems that we might have.</br></br>

UCI: Mhmm.</br></br>

Caller: For sure that because you know, I'm still maybe want to request another see if I finished with my full process of the vaccine.</br></br>

UCI: Mhmm, have a lot of people at your facility been getting vaccinated?</br></br>

Caller: Truthfully, for the most part, I don’t, I haven't been paying attention but I'm sure they have. Yes, and service staff as well as well as inmates but, then again to the distance and the quarantine process that we go through. We don't really meet this, high security on coming in close to each other and making sure that we tested temperatures and checking on us and all that stuff.</br></br>

But a lot of things I was taking away from this as well due to COVID, that we need to reestablish and bring back in. As far as like I said, the visiting, movement, etc etc things that that would also help us while we here facing these mental challenges and, go for going through our cases and whatnot, you know?</br></br>

UCI: Mhmm, how have you been coping with the crisis?</br></br>

Caller: Well I pray on it you know I put a lot of prayer in it, and I wash my hands a lot and I watch my distances with people. I write a lot of letters. I was gonna say if you will be able to supply or send any supplies that, that will be helpful for like you know, coping with as far as writing letters and coloring.</br></br>

UCI: Okay, did you have anything else you wanted to let people know about your experience over the phone? Or would you be more comfortable doing that over the letter? Hello? Are you still there?</br></br>

Caller: Excuse me. Hello.</br></br>

UCI Hello? Sorry.</br></br>

Caller: Is the overseer like the main advocate of this program?</br></br>

UCI: Yes, we, it’s a group of faculty and students at the University of California Irvine.</br></br>

Caller: Okay, so that I'll be forwarding some of my experiences and you could- Do I say right now if you want to put it on the, upload this for purposes of helping others cope with the pandemic or is this going to automatically go there?</br></br>

UCI: Yeah. Because you consented at the beginning of the call this call will be put up on the website. And it'll be put up- Yes, we'll have the both the audio, the audio and a transcript of the audio on the website.</br></br>

Caller: Excuse me.</br></br>

UCI: Hello?</br></br>

Caller: Hello.</br></br>

UCI: Hello, can you hear me still?</br></br>

Caller: Yes.</br></br>

UCI: What were you saying? I'm sorry, I didn't get that.</br></br>

Caller: So in the event that I'm enrolled into the college, will we be able to further continue this pandemic experience?</br></br>

UCI: This project does not do anything about enrolling you and sorry, this project doesn't do anything about enrolling you into the college, right now we're just collecting stories. To create a digital digital archive of what's happening inside of California prisons and jails.</br></br>

Caller: Oh, okay.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, so we're just sorry.</br></br>

Caller: I'll probably call you back later, because I need to write some more notes down about my experiences in this pandemic and some valuable information that I’ve obtained from this call.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, of course, I look forward to hearing from you later to later tonight or in the future. We all look forward to hearing your story. And look forward to reading your letters if you send one. I'd like to thank you for participating in PrisonPandemic and if you could tell your friends or anybody about us to see if they'd like to call or write letters as well.</br></br>

Caller: Okay, and like we need we need, we need all of these programs to open up and expand we need more different but like, creative style masks, or some type, you know, programs where inmates can be able to make create masks, create designs, and put them out to the community that's helping the community as well helping a pandemic, etc. etc.</br></br>

UCI: Mhmm.</br></br>
