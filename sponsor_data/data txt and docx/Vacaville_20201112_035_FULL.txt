This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Vacaville.</br></br>

The way COVID-19 has affected us in Vacaville, we had a minimal program that includes groups of any sort. We have not been allowed any visits since the pandemic started, not even behind glass visits. Phone calls were supposed to be free on certain days. But when it came down to having that free phone call, there has always been an issue with the phones. Either the phones are down and not working or calls are just static. Calls get disconnected after five minutes or you simply cannot hear the other person.</br></br>

Also, correction officers are not even wearing face masks and LTN SGT don’t say a word to them. But as soon as we are seen without our mask or not on properly we get told something. And even threats to get a 115 if masks are not on properly. This is unfair, phones and even pressure cuffs are not being wiped after every use. And they are still putting three to four inmates in the shower at the same time. CDC is not following any of the guidelines and when inspection is coming, then they all follow the rules. But as soon as they leave, it goes back to normal. This is an issue that truly needs to get checked.</br></br> 

A revise of our health and safety is not being met, keeping sick inmates in dorms of eight to 16, only two feet apart in bunks, next to non-sick inmates. I myself was sick. I had all the symptoms of COVID-19, high fever of 103 to 104, headaches, problems breathing, and weakness. I was in the cell for three days without any kind of help. They only gave me Tylenol every six to eight hours, and blood pressure checks twice a day, and they turned off my water in the sink so I wouldn't overdrink too much water. CDC is not taking security measures. They have been transferring inmates to and from institutions that have had or still have positive COVID-19 inmates. They simply do not care about our wellbeing.</br></br> 

I personally heard a SGT tell another correction officers and nurses “well at least we wouldn't have to worry about reducing the prison population, COVID is doing it for us,” These are people in charge of our safety and health but they truly are not in the position to help us. I am hoping this could shed some light on what is going on behind these prison walls and hopefully someone out there will be able to see what is really going on in these prisons.
