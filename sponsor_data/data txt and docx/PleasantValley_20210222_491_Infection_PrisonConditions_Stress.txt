This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Pleasant Valley.</br></br>

The COVID-19 hit this prison like a major tidal wave. Everyone started getting sick from left to right, I didn't feel safe at all around anyone. I feel like all of it could have been prevented if the correctional officers, medical staff, and all other staff in this facility were properly practicing safety-ness, and properly conducting sanitation and wearing their mask.</br></br>

That's basically how it got so bad in the institution. All the chemicals that were being used at the time to clean and sanitize, the correctional officers would water it down with mostly water; I guess to save the state money or something I don't know. So basically, everything was being cleaned and sanitized with basically water, from the showers we all shared and shower in from the tables and benches we all sit at during our day room time.</br></br>

So yeah, a big part of negligence plays here on the staff and correctional officers' behalf! But there was nothing much we all could do about it. We all just had to deal and cope with it. I would just think positive thoughts, and tell myself that there's someone out there, in another state, country or somewhere in a worse, much worse predicament, than what I'm going through.
