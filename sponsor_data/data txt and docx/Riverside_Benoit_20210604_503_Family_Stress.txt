<em>This story was told by a family member of someone incarcerated at John J. Benoit Detention Center.</br></br></em>

Caller: How it has affected us? The District Attorney of Riverside County has actually now decided to alter the state record based on their own discretion and add into a minute order that I am now permanently banned from seeing my husband until he gets released.</br></br> 

UCI: Wow.</br></br> 

Caller: And that was through bleaching, sanitation, and alteration of a state document, which is in line with RICO action. And this is the District Attorney's office of Riverside County. So, how this is happening, it's now we're trying to fight and we actually found mistakes within the records, we found mistakes within the documents, and we are taking it up to the Court of Appeals so that way I can finally see him.</br></br> 

Because Captain Read lifted the ban on April 1st and the judge and the District Attorney, what is alleged, it appears that they've had an ex parte communication and got the minute order altered based on their own discretion to where I am now banned.

How this has affected us? It's - I am his only support system. He is an ADA inmate. They are now holding discrimination based on the American Disability Act. He now does not have access to his mental support.</br></br> 

So, that's how COVID-19 has affected us. But, I got so sick and tired of everybody telling me no I went up to the Board of Corrections in Sacramento, spoke with a field representative of Riverside County, and was able to activate a meeting in which opened up marriages for the entire county.</br></br> 

UCI: That's good. That is definitely good. I'm so glad that you took the initiative to do that.</br></br> 

Caller: Yeah, not really somebody who agrees with people telling them to shut up. I don't roll over and say, okay.</br></br> 

UCI: And so, since you've been banned, like, how have you been coping with it, like, the reduced visitation and everything?</br></br> 

Caller: Well, they said, according to the judge, he said that it's for our own protection and it's for our own good, but yet I would like to ban him from his girlfriend and say, it's for your own good. My anxiety has been skyrocketing since this. I have been more on the go, like, now what can we do to really have this crap stop.</br></br> 

It's been affecting my schoolwork, it's been affecting my work. It's affecting my ability to sleep. You know, I can't see him. I mean, talking to him is great but there's just something about seeing the person that you care about the most that really â€“ you know what I mean? Am I making sense to you?</br></br> 

UCI: Yeah, you are. I couldn't imagine.
