Orange County jails are “stuck” although the COVID-19 vaccine has been offered to all inmates and for the most part, the pandemic is under control; the OC jails’ kitchens are still closed! We get two baloney sandwich, one orange, one milk, one pack of mini cookies, served at 35 degrees to 40 degrees cold for breakfast, lunch, and dinners!</br></br>

Inhumane, unjust, cruel, and sad. I’ve been here since Feb., this has been going on for over one year!</br></br>

Because of ACLU, Judge Wilson, demanded jails population to be cut to 50%. I’m not sure if this is still being honored or not. But it seems that cruel food should be grounds enough for an “early kick” or early release.</br></br>

PPP or PrisonPandemic project, have not even scratch the surface of incarceration during the pandemic. I am (because LGBT, I’m gay) housed on a mod. But barracks and dorms were really affected. I’ve heard of inmates, at the beginning of the pandemic, being neglected because COVID-19 was often confused with the flu.</br></br>

Inmates who complained about their lungs and jail deputies neglected. Jails in Orange County are known for the cruelty from deputies. Also, OC jails’ time calculation is at 50%. You have to do six month out of 12 months. San Diego, San Bernardino counties do 30%, LA does 10%!</br></br>

But the food pre-during-post COVID-19 is cruelty, inhumane, unjust and nobody cares about inmates’ lives.
