This story was told by a person incarcerated at North County Correctional Facility.</br></br>Caller: I’m in the LA County jail right now, and basically the way these people in here handle the covid crisis when it first happened was they didn’t give us any face masks, they didn’t give us any solutions, or constantly taking our solution in here. And when we have outbreaks, they don’t give us anything to clean the dorm with.</br></br>They come by and act like they’re spraying the bars with some kind of disinfectant and they just spray the bars and just walk on. And okay, what about us in here? You know what I’m saying? And I got covid twice while being in this facility. And it was just crazy—the way these people treated us.</br></br>They literally came into the dorm, brought in two bottles of solution with a bag of rags, took a picture of it on the table, went to the phones, acted like they put more solution bottles on the phones with the bag of rags in front of the phones, took a picture of that, and then took those bottles of solutions and that bag of rags and went to the next dorm and took more pictures.</br></br>I was like “Wow, this is crazy.” And they want to constantly come in here and tell us we can’t have bottles for solution and we can’t have cleaning supplies.</br></br>Oh, and the court tanks, when you go to court it’s absolutely disgusting. I mean, there’s obviously gonna be trash everywhere, it’s a facility, but I mean there’s cockroaches everywhere inside the tanks, there’s nowhere to lay down because there’s food all over the tanks, peanut butter on the walls, jelly on the walls, and it’s just out of line.</br></br>There’s nothing we can do about it because the second you start complaining, they tell you, “Oh yeah, we’ll get on it, we’ll get on it” and then when you put in agreements, they don’t even respond to the agreements half the time. It just gets thrown out.</br></br>UCI: How has the vaccination situation been like at your facility?</br></br>Caller: We just got vaccinated recently actually. They gave us the Johnson & Johnson here and then at a different facility where somebody I know is at, they gave them the one that starts with the V, I’m not sure which one that was but yeah, they just just vaccinated us.</br></br>UCI: How has the covid situation at your facility affected your loved ones?</br></br>Caller: Basically, my parents weren’t allowed to visit. I haven’t been able to see them at court because everything’s just been going on. Nobody I know personally has caught covid except for me and another family member of mine that is incarcerated with me.</br></br>But yeah, the cops sometimes they don’t wear masks. They sit there talking with their masks off and everything like that, you know. And then they want to come in here and act like, you know, we’re doing something wrong when we’re asking them “Can we get some masks?” Or “Can we get this?” or “Can we get some cleaning supplies?” or “Can we get some mops?” cause we don’t have mops or anything like that.</br></br> We have to ask for the mops and half the time they don’t even give us the mops to clean our dorms so what we use is we use towels. And when we ask for clean towels, it’s always a hassle. And when we ask for a blanket to cut up into cleaning rags, it’s always a hassle. Like, it’s ridiculous.</br></br>They’re supposed to give us green scrubbing patch for the showers and the restroom facilities and they don’t even give us those. They don’t give us the brooms. They don’t give us the gloves when we ask for them.</br></br>Literally they’ll give us four gloves for each side of the day rooms because of this politics here. They’ll give us gloves for the Blacks and for the Hispanics. And four gloves and that’s it. It’s like if we ask for more, they think, I don’t know what they think.</br></br>UCI: How have you been coping with everything?</br></br>Caller: I just go day by day. That’s all you can really do in here. I’ve been in here for over three years now and the covid really changed things in here. It changed the way we are trying to get our voices heard and it just, you know, it changed the way we thought about it but it didn’t change the way they were handling the situation.</br></br>UCI: What would’ve made your situation at the facility better?</br></br>Caller: Them not housing us the way they’ve been housing us because at one point, the dorm I’m currently in, at one point, we had like 20 people out of let’s say 66, right. And at that point, they moved all of us downstairs to all the racks and put us right on top of each other and the racks are three high and the racks are literally only what like two and a half feet apart.</br></br>Like the racks are two and a half feet apart so you got 11 rows of racks with three racks stacked in each row or in each bunks. So that’s 33 bunks and they had us all stacked on top of each other. And they were trying to tell us that we had to fill up the whole bottom tier of the dorm before they could fill up the top and then we actually went and complained and they let us separate again so they could follow the social distancing.</br></br>UCI: What else do you want people to know about your experience?</br></br>Caller: Just that it’s really corrupt in here. I feel it’s really corrupt and I feel they’re not really doing enough for us. And this place is filthy. And you know, I’ve seen people catch staff in here just from a little tiny cut because of how dirty it is in here.</br></br>And I’ve seen people catch covid multiple times. I’ve seen people I consider friends in here almost die because of the situation they put us in during the covid outbreak. People were having to go downtown and I’ve seen one dude, he had a 103 degree fever and they didn’t check him off for two days until he finally went up the bars and was like “You guys need to take me out of here.”</br></br>UCI: Is there anything else you’d like to share?</br></br>Caller: No, I think that’s it. I just wanted to let you guys know what was going on in the LA County Jail. This place is way out of control and they don’t do enough for us health wise and, you know, to keep this place clean. That’s all I wanted to let you guys know.
