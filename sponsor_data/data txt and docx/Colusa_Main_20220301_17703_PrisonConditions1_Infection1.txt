This story was told by a person incarcerated at Colusa County Jail.</br></br>

UCI: All right, what has the COVID situation been like at your facility?</br></br>

Caller: We always have to wear masks when we leave the cell. Other than that, I’ve gotten — when I went to medical, they asked me if I wanted the COVID shot. I said, "Yeah," but they never gave it to me and it’s kind of dirty in here, I guess. Not really clean, nothing really sanitary and we have things on the wall, but they don't, they don’t get used and they don't get re-, like restocked, I guess.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>

Caller: And yeah, that’s about it, I guess. Nothing gets wiped down, everything stays gross.</br></br>

UCI: And do you think if you asked for sanitizing materials that they’d provide them?</br></br>

Caller: When they were, when they were ready to give it to us, but probably takes a minute to get anything to us really.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>

Caller: I’ve asked for cleaning supplies and it takes at least a day or two to get it to us.</br></br>

UCI: Thank you. And have they offered you the vaccine again, or is that something you would have to keep asking for?</br></br>

Caller: I think, well, I’ve asked for it twice already and they said, "Yeah," when they one time comes. But they never gave it to me yet. I would like it. But I've been trying to get it. Due, if I got sick in here I don't want to stay sick and I didn’t want to —</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>

Caller: Get sick and die. That's why I thought about it and I've asked them about it twice and I still haven’t got it.</br></br>

UCI: Have they administered it to other people there?</br></br>

Caller: She asked us about it, so I’m not sure if she has or not. But I believe - hey, has anybody got the COVID shot, have you guys haven’t got it yet. But have they asked us, because I have asked about it. See they don't, they don’t ask us constantly, no.</br></br>

UCI: Okay.</br></br>

Caller: I asked the — I also went into the doctor I had asked them about it.
