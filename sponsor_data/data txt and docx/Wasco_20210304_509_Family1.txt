This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Wasco.</br></br>

It was crazy, I had to call my people. Keep in mind I cant just call at any time I have to wait until its my day for phone calls. As I was on the phone I asked my people whats going on out there. They gave me the whole rundown I said to myself “Damn shit just got real.”</br></br> 

Okay now you asked me what has it been like to be inside at this time. Well its a trip because first your wondering if your families okay, if they have all the supplies they need because from the new’s they say its hard to get supplies, if there not in stalk the prices are higher and to think your people can get layed off at any day.</br></br> 

Your people get jacked, your people may get COVID and die also. You’re in jail so you can’t see them before they do die but God forbid that happens. Not being able to pay the bills.</br></br> 

Shit you don't even want to ask for money because you think they may need it more shit I cant even imagine if I had kids man thats something I cant imagine because I don't have kids so think about all that and trip out because your sitting in a six by ten cell and there’s nothing you can do or know that your people are safe and sound.</br></br> 

It gets bad to where you cant sleep at night because your thinking about your family, friends, people who don't have a place to go or eat. People that you hope think about you now and then people that you love, homie’s that are from your hood. I had plenty of days where I didn't want to eat, sleep, or even get out bed and I'm they type of prisoner that programs at 5-5:30am and sleep around 10 or 11:00 the latest.</br></br>
