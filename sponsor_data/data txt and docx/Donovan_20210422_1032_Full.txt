This story was told by a person incarcerated at Donovan.</br></br> UCI: And can you give me your testimonial about any aspects you think are important for people to know about the situation of incarcerated people, at Donovan during COVID-19?</br></br>Caller: Well, one of the biggest things that I noticed is basically, people just were in fear of losing their connection with their, with their loved ones, their wives. They didn't know how to how to handle not not being able to receive visits, and it was just unknown, like, you know, I mean, to me, personally, I didn't know if I was gonna die in here, my family was gonna die out there, like we didn't, we were kind of just like stuck.</br></br>Caller: And then once, once people started getting infected, there wasn't really much that anyone can do about it, we weren't really getting any kind of treatment, other than temperature check. And you know, that a lot of times our gloves weren't being changed out in between COVID tests, the nurses were using the same gloves to just go from one cell to the next. And I noticed that the porters in the building, they weren't being given our proper disinfectant.</br></br>Caller: I work in the clinic so I know that we need 64 Cell Block to kill those kind of viruses. And I you know, I watched the porters cleaning with Breakout, legit a degreaser. And they weren't being given rags, a lot of them will just wipe down the phones with with the same rags, just renting them out doing as much as they can, with their own, you know, [unintelligible] since renting out their towels and stuff.</br></br>Caller: And it was a scary situation, because I've never been through something like this. And I've never really thought that a prison can get shut down like that, like statewide. So there was a lot of things going on that we just, it was the unknown. I think that was kind of difficult for everybody. You know, guys started committing suicide more than before COVID on this yard, and I've personally had to clean up one last week in one building, blood everywhere, it was kind of kind of sick man, you know, was nasty having to clean that up.</br></br>Caller: Since I work in the clinic, you know, we're trained to, to pick a biohazard and all that, uh, as I was cleaning it up, another guy cut his throat in another cell. So it's like, people are going through a lot of mental health issues, and they don't have no one to talk to. Now that is getting a little bit better. You know, I guess they have more clinicians coming in and stuff like that. But just as we're getting better now we're back to this 14 day quarantine.</br></br>Caller: So it's really hard on, on people not being able to see friends from other buildings as well that, you know, some there's a lot of guys that I played music with, that I used to socialize with, and, and I wasn’t unable to talk to those guys anymore. And like, we're, each building was kind of living in their own world, because we don't get to see the other buildings. So it was it was difficult seeing guys pass away that that I actually sat there and played guitar with one that was in one of my music programs. You know, just they were at churches knowing that they were just here and all of a, a sudden this pandemic hit that everyone at times didn't know if it was real, or if it was true, or if it was going to get into the prison.</br></br>Caller: And next thing you know, you see guys are no longer here because they died from it. I was forced to get married. I was a childhood sweetheart and COVID you know, if we're waiting and waiting, and it says, went on longer than we thought and that didn't work out. So, I mean, maybe it was for a reason, but I personally know that it did damage relationships.</br></br>UCI: So I'm sorry. You mentioned like what's going on right now? You guys are on 14-day lockdown. What is the current COVID situation at your facility right now?</br></br>Caller: Currently they, they claim that people were reinfected. I'm hearing that they were, the administration was saying that it was because of the visitations. But where I work at, I hear officers saying that it was through other officers. So I really don't know what to believe, but they did shut down our visitations and put us back on this 14 day quarantine. I don't know what yards other infections are at, but I believe there are some in one block and the yard. So I know they have some people in isolation in one building right now. And so, they start, went back to only calling one, one building at a time to the clinic.</br></br>Caller: But, you know, sometimes they, they want to rush thing, so they just kind of don't take it too serious. And you know, you have guys out there that are in separate buildings and stuff like that. So I, I didn't really see them taking it too serious when it was blowing out that the first time. And now we see the results that we got from it, you know?</br></br>UCI: Yeah so to end so to your knowledge, do you know of any, like members of the population that Donovan currently have COVID? It's just, you just heard you just heard like, you're not 100% sure, about prisoners, prisoners or staff?</br></br>Caller: I'm not 100% sure. But I just overheard staff saying that there were some positive cases on one yard. And I clean one building every day because I work in HFM so I have to go into the field rooms and clean them. And I know that right now, they have all of upper block and lower block on quarantine in one building because of possible infections or, or people that came in contact with others who have COVID. So they just started testing people again, today.</br></br>UCI: Okay. So yeah, how is the staff in handling the current outbreak? </br></br>Caller: Well, they, they, they, they started off by not calling people from different buildings to the clinic. So they're only doing certain buildings that are at a time, just one building at a time. But then, as it doesn't really make sense, because they'll do it for a little while, then they'll get I guess, frustrated or want to finish and then they'll start calling other buildings out as well. So it's like, I think it's kind of they're doing it halfway. It doesn't seem like, like they're taking it too serious.</br></br>UCI: Yeah, right. Right. Like they, it they've already gone through it for a year. And they kind of just like you mentioned they just kind of like, get through it quick. And they just don't, not really paying attention.</br></br>Caller: Yeah, yeah, that's exactly what it is. They rather finish the shift, finish off the medical docket early so they can relax and take a nap then to take the, our health concern seriously. And, you know, stay working a little bit longer during their shift. They I mean, they rather just finish and hurry up so you can relax, you know? As far as in the clinic, where I work, I get to see that because I have to wipe things down after each patient comes in to see the doctor.</br></br>UCI: And the, what are your current concerns? Like what do you want the public to know about what's going on right now.</br></br>Caller: Well, right now, man, there's these people that are cutting themselves and committing suicide man and people that are walking around here are depressed people that have never, I mean, there's some guys that have gotten used to being in isolation or guys have done shoe terms and are mentally capable of dealing with these kinds of things. But a lot of the population is not strong enough to deal with that not having anyone to talk to, not having groups not having, it's like people are not able to to rehabilitate right now like on their own. A lot of guys need help to do that, they need guidance, and they're sitting here not able to receive this help.</br></br>Caller: And some guys are gonna get out soon, you know, and those are gonna be guys that are in the community, it might be your neighbor, you know, and they're sitting here, not able to get the help that they need. So that's very concerning, you know, I'm getting out this year, possibly, in December. And, you know, I know that that guys really need a lot of help, that are going home and they're not able to get it right now, thankfully, I've been participating in and recovery for years now over a decade, and I'm ready to get out and be a good neighbor to everybody, anyone that I live next to, but there's a lot of guys that need help here, man, and they're not getting it. Because the COVID and people are breaking down mentally, because they don't have anything going on with their with their program right now.</br></br>Caller: I mean, they give packets, but it doesn't really, it's not the same as being able to go to a group and interact with, with volunteers and staff and having a facilitator break down steps to them and and do these things within that are normally done.</br></br>UCI: Right! No, that's Yeah, that's what we've been hearing. Is there anything that you can think of that can make things at your facility better? Caller: Well, if we were able to have groups, even at a limited capacity, that would be a good start, I think. And then staff come in here every day, as far as the guards, so I don't see whyvolunteers can’t get tested and come in as well. So that at least the people that are breaking down mentally, right now would be able to, to have something positive like that intheir day, instead of just being stuck in their cell. Trying to go through a packet, you know. So being able to have some groups back, that would definitely be a big help to the facility, in my opinion.</br></br>UCI: And how has the situation affected your loved ones, like the COVID-19 situation?</br></br>Caller: Well, you know, they were very, they were worried, very stressed of not knowing if they would see me again, or if I was going to die in here. You know, I would call my mom and she, you know, I got arrested when I was 14 for committing a crime and I'm about to get out. So, she was like, very depressed, thinking that she waited all this time, just to see me, you know, pass away to this to this virus that was being spread in here. So it was really sad for me to hear her worry like that. My brother's every, everybody was worried they didn't know what was going to happen to me because they heard about how it was spreading in here.</br></br>Caller: And they knew that we weren't getting any treatment, you know. So it was it was very difficult for them. They got sick out there, but they luckily, they made it. So yeah, it was just it was hard to to hear them stress when I got infected with the COVID. It was, it was for me, it was terrible. It was the worst, worst feeling I've ever had. And I didn't even call them and tell them because I didn't want them to worry. I just I got through it myself by myself. And that was it.</br></br>Caller: It was it was difficult, but they still worry right now, you know, now that there's new variants and stuff like that. They still worry about it, but I tried to reassure them that everything's gonna be fine.</br></br>UCI: That's hard. Wow. Yeah, I know you're gonna get out. That's great.</br></br>Caller: Well, yeah, definitely. I mean, I made it through COVID one, so I'm pretty sure I'll make it again. But just have to see. People go through this because a lot of people can take it. Fortunately, these 23 years, made me pretty strong mentally and, and I'm able to you know, I was able to turn something that is, was very scary and hard into something great like through music. And they will do to, to find things out about myself that I didn't know before. And it did help me a lot as messed up as it was this year.</br></br>Caller: I found out some good things about myself, man and and I'm happy about that. But, you know, not everybody turns out that way a lot of guys are really, really going through it and, and stressed out.UCI: Yeah, I mean, you kind of started talking about like, it's good. Next question. I was gonna ask you just how you been coping with the crisis? So, music has been helping you?</br></br>Caller: Man, I, I spent a lot of time playing guitar, wrote songs that I didn't think I could write. And, you know, it's music really helped me a lot. I spent so many months, well every month playing and writing music and it definitely opened doors in my mind that were shut before. I didn't, you know, I believe in myself more now. I know that, that I'm a good songwriter now. And it just my guitar level went up. And it was definitely something that helped me get by andhelped a lot of the guys in here too, that were in my building. You know, they had instruments and we'd share songs with each other and stuff. And it was something that really helped a lot of people out.</br></br>Caller: I needed a little bit more than faith, because faith was failing me. And music was able to do that for me when I didn't have anything else. Not even faith. You know, music was there every time. So, Music Man, it really, really, really helped me out during this time.</br></br>UCI: That's amazing. Yeah. Let me see. And so, is there anything? What else? Is there anything else you want people to know about your experience?</br></br>Caller: Well, my experience with this is I, I feel like there needs to be more preparation for situations like this and CDC because we're kind of just shut down and and things weren't being handled the way that they should be, or the way that people were probably thinking they were being handled. There's, there's no, there's got to be better ways to deal with these situations if they should ever occur again. I mean, we're still living through it right now. But there's, there's just got to be a better way to.</br></br>Caller: It’s very hard for people in certain areas. I mean, I've, I've had good coping skills, but I feel bad for the guys that that can get through this, you know, it's really hard on people. And there has to be something done about it. Guys are just trying to take their lives and some of them succeeded at it, you know, and people need, need, need help in here?</br></br>UCI: Yeah, I mean, that's kind of like, that's what these calls are about, like, in terms of like testimonials. And you know, I mean, we're gathering these so maybe we can see some kind of change in the future when people listen to these events and have different ideas of how things should be done. You know, I mean, I really, really appreciate your time calling it see it's now 10:52pm. Thank you for participating in prison pandemic. I'm about to end this call in this recording.
