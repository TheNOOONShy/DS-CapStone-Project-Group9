This story was told by a person incarcerated at OC Central Justice Central. </br></br>


UCI: It is now May 20 at 8:33pm. So how are you today? </br></br>


Caller: Uh, I’m alright. </br></br>


UCI: Okay, that's good. Which facility Are you currently housed at? </br></br>


Caller: Uh, Central Men's Jail.  </br></br>


UCI: Okay. And what has the COVID situation been like at your facility? </br></br>


Caller: Excuse me? </br></br>


UCI: What has the COVID situation been like at your facility? </br></br>


Caller: I've only been here for about a month but I was in the Theo Lacy facility for a good two and a half years. Long time. I've been here for about a month. Over here, you know, it was just yesterday it was just yesterday was the first day we had coronavirus killing solution. </br></br>


We've had sanitizer that does it too but that's as far as it goes. No liquid solution that actually goes and kills a virus we just got that recently that is only able to be used for showers. And at the area where I'm at for tables and chairs inside of a day room area. </br></br>


But we've had other solution which was cleaning solution and it was never noted that it was for uh to kill the coronavirus. You know, again, I've only been in this facility or, not facility, the jail jail, for about a month now at the Theo Lacy facility, we didn't, I mean, it was it was way rougher over there. Way rougher. </br></br>


I mean, you know, you would think a year after the pandemic. A year, March, April, about 13 months after the pandemic now you're being given the coronavirus killing solution that it was you know, I just noted that over here and that was yesterday and I've been here for a month, but over there I don't know how it's working out but there were times in the beginning that the solution, the cleaning solution, would run out but you know, that was it so. </br></br>


You have to make the best out of it but after a few months of everything I was- they were, you know, replacing it a little more but it was solution to just to clean up and everything but you know, surprisingly I don't know how the mattresses, the area, the wall, you know just anything in contact with anyone that was in contact with or not in contact with- I don't understand how like that was for sure like not thoroughly cleaned or sanitized with coronavirus killing solutions. That was over there. </br></br>


Over here it just seems like I just came to like a new area and you know, things were dusty and didn't seem like it was cleaned prior to people arriving. So that’s just uh- not only that, when you're when you're in quarantine, quarantine is very rough. You're only given 30 minute day rooms and in the day rooms are able to shower, you're able to come out of your cell. </br></br>


They’re in two man cells, you know, you never know if you're with one person or- in which if you were with another person and people were complaining about hygiene [unintelligible]. This is you know, when they’re first coming in, that the pin number is working so they can call loved ones and stuff to make a phone call like this. They're only allowed to be outside for a little bit, you know, like 20, 30 minutes. </br></br>


Yeah, that was that was the other facility that was at the Theo Lacy facility and I think the majority of the people were taken there when they first got into jail- facility, so. It was yeah, it was it was pretty rough. I mean, you got to get the sanitizer which is the only coronavirus killing solution which is only for your hands. That took a good couple months just to receive that. Like I said for a couple months just to have some solution. </br></br>


But when it came to the actual actual coronavirus killing solution that was a liquid to sanitize surfaces and everything, that's not a sanitizer that was just a liquid, it took about 13 months for that. We were given, you know, we were given rags to go ahead and clean every Friday. We were given some type of commissary. </br></br>


In the very beginning, we were getting we were given apples, we were given pears, you know, it was you know, it was it was nice to have a change, but we've only had cold food since, like I said, I've been down two and a half years. And when it started in March I was here you know, there was there was a nice, there was a nice change of you know, reusing an apples or oranges, cold meals which consists of sandwiches, meat, a fruit, an apple and orange. There’s a vitamin drink, which is a good source, I think it's the company's name and it's just vitamin drink. </br></br>


You get cookies, a pack of four, and that's what we would be given for lunch and dinner. So whether you know if you had a diet sometimes, you know, if your lunch went missing, you know you're screwed. But that was the- in the very, very beginning. </br></br>


I remember once it started like on the 16th of March- this pandemic, it was taken a little more seriously, 15th of March. The way it was handled in here was very reckless. It was just like you're on your own kind of or pretty much you were. And it was just luck of the draw, you end up with who you're around, but they were quarantined and everything. But the cold meals, the cold meals- March, April, May, like three months. </br></br>


And then you know, in some areas the hot meals did open up, and again, I'm talking about the Theo Lacy facility. But then in December when it spiked, when it spiked, you know, I remember everybody was put on quarantine- the whole, I think it was both the jail, which is in Santa Ana, and the Theo Lacy facility in Orange. The only two jails we have in Orange County, I think everybody was put on lockdown. </br></br>


And that's where everybody was in the quarantine, and 30 minute day rooms, it was really, really, really rough, especially when you're given cold food and no room, no time to unstress yourself and get a get a little exercise, walk around like you get 30 minutes to shower and have a phone call, maybe 30, 20 to 30 minutes, it was very rough. </br></br>


You never knew if after two weeks, workers coming in, if they have it or not. It turned out that, you know, not only are the people walking in and out of the facility that are authorized to, but the inmates, we get no contact visits, we are not only in contact with each other. And we were just sitting, you know, sitting ducks when it came to whether we can affect it or not. And the whole facility at Theo Lacy there was only one mod that had two sectors, N36 and 34. </br></br>


You know, this is what I heard. But then again, you know, this is also the truth. But um that were untouched by the coronavirus, only two sectors of all the facility. And this is including the larger holding areas of individuals. So the whole facility, there's only two sectors that never had a positive case, I think and Central Men’s Jail there are many, many cases. So and we don't know how that's holding. </br></br>


But, you know, that's as far as, as far as you could say a few months ago. But even you know, the worst part about it, you know, not only was just the virus issue, but your courts weren't taken seriously. Pushed off, pushed off, like who cares? Let's not even ask him to show up. You know, like you, you're- what's the reason to be in jail if you're not going to court? Having to wait a whole year just to have a hearing, because of the pandemic when the court has a lot of free time. It's just unheard of. </br></br>


Things, you know, things like that, you know, when it came to cleaning, came to court being pushed off, you're just you're just sitting here. When there's a lot of free time, when there's a lot of financial resources to assist. But you're just like oh well. Yeah. You know, on Fridays, yeah, there was there was a commissary given, a couple. Hold on. I have to- give me, give me, give me a second hold on. </br></br>


Hello? Okay. </br></br>


UCI: Yes. So yeah. My next question to you was, since people have been getting vaccinated,  how's the vaccination situation been like at your facility? </br></br>


Caller: It was this year when they offered it. Most people were, you know, the people that did take it, they were complaining about, like, having headaches and everything and all that, but you know, there’s people that took it. But they started offering it to elderly people, and people that were overweight first, but it was it was like they were picking and choosing who they offered it to, which kind of throws me off- I was nearly you know when you're when you're sitting around, you're not doing much. </br></br>


I mean, everybody's just- there’s not much to exercise and can't run around, can’t really do too much exercise. Besides, you're sharing a little cell with another individual. An individual stress related push if they're able to or not, it's, it's pretty stressful. Again, a closed door for so long, it’s up to the individual, if they're able to program in that way and get a little workout going. There's not much you can do. </br></br>


But um, you know, the court situation has really, really, really, really surprised me as well. You know, you're just, you're sitting around, you know, you're sitting around. Vaccines and everything and like, I think, I think it was I heard that it was like, January? Yeah, it was January, it was January when there were talks about it. I think it was January, there's like talks about like, maybe jail will be getting some type of priority for vaccines, but I think it wasn't- I think it was March or February, like probably like late February. Or was it March? It wasn't, it wasn't April. February, March. </br></br>


And sort of asking people- it was mainly you know, the elders, those that were overweight, and it was you know, like yeah, they were offered the Moderna or the Pfizer. When you know people- people you know, if they didn’t take it it didn't matter what age they were if they’re overweight, but only if they're elderly. Yeah, they were offered that, so. </br></br>


I was, you know, I was never asked at that facility till- I think until like April, when they started handing out papers that like if you voluntarily want to get it- go ahead and put your name on his paper and then turn it in and then you'll be able to get it so- everybody else I guess or me as well. There's five people asked that even weren't overweight, they were given priority. So yeah it was very selective- was, you know, the vaccine. But then again that was the facilities that they, yeah it was offered. </br></br>

Caller: Yeah, thank you for hearing. I think we were talking about like writing out- what are some questions that should be answered? </br></br>


UCI: Just in regards to COVID in different things like that. We sent out letters, I'm pretty sure that's how you were- received the call list, for the letters, but you could just respond and also-
Caller: Only one person that received that I've ever seen and I’ve been moved around a little bit. </br></br>


UCI: Yeah, well yeah, you could just um if you want to write in and tell us more about your story, you can definitely do that. </br></br>


Caller: But yeah, that's the story. But what if I was uh- reaching out, reaching out like to tell you like story, you know, further in depth. Because things were heading very stagnant because of that. </br></br>


UCI: Yeah. You could just write it in and we'll be sure to take note of it and someone will respond to you. </br></br>
