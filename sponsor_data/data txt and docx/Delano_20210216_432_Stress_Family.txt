This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Delano.</br></br>

During this pandemic, I'm sure each and every prisoner in the nation have experienced a level of added depress and stress. Several guys have lost family members to COVID-19. As for me I’ve had my niece, aunt, son, and daughter test positive. It's definitely added concern for them and myself daily.</br></br>

But I try to remain positive that this shall pass and things will return to normal. Many guys here have been given the vaccine within the past week, which is a good sign. The news has been reporting that numbers have risen tremendously of people out there being vaccinated.</br></br>

Though we have a lot more to do, but it's still progress.</br></br>
 
The lack of visits have been really hard on me. Because the human/physical contact from family and loved ones are major stress releases. And I’m able to maintain those connections and family ties through being abreast on what’s going on in their lives.</br></br>

That I am unable to learn through a 15-minute phone call.</br></br>
 
Lately, to cope with this crisis, I’ve been writing and reading a lot. Recently, I began making donations to the LA Food Bank monthly. I figure through my earnings from my job I can afford to make a small donation to help those who are struggling to eat as a result of job losses and etc.
