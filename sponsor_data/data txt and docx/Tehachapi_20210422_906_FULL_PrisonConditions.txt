The days are short and the nights are long in this COVID-19 pandemic. We seem to think that we are nearing an end. God knows that we all could be wrong. COVID-19 will never leave us where it found us because things in life simply do not end that way.</br></br>

We are faring somewhat better on a daily basis because we have recreational time from 10:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. daily. We have recreational time from 7:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. daily. The brisk walks and the fresh air (outside) do the body, mind and soul much good.</br></br>

There is rumor circulating that the yard that I am incarcerated and house on will shut down by June 30, 2021. Employees and inmates are on pins and needles looking at the disruption and futuristic change. People can stomach upset and change. They do not welcome it well.</br></br>

No matter how bleak things seem in the world. God is still in business and in command of this universe. We are all influenced by this pandemic. We will understand what is happening behind it more when we come to accept ourselves and understand ourselves more on an individual basis.</br></br>

My physical span on Earth is a training station for lessons to be learned by us all. None of what is happening now because of this pandemic will not matter 100 years from now or by 2121. Will it? I do not think so.</br></br>

I love all you there. Please let us not take our guards down in this pandemic. I salute you all with love.
