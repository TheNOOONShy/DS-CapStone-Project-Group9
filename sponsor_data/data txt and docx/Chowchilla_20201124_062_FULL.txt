This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Chowchilla.</br></br>

I was asked to participate in your question and answer survey.</br></br>  1. What has it been like inside during this time?</br></br> 
It has been horrible. We're totally locked down. No church, library, groups, most of all no visits. As well, medical staff is very limited and slow coming. For the yard's skilled nursing facility, however, they continue to allow us the use of the telephones, which is a plus so that our family and friends will know that we're okay.</br></br> 2. How do you feel about your safety inside?</br></br> 
Not sure! This was even before the coronavirus. To me there are way too many “bullies” here and the correctional officers seem to be very limited as what they care about to do with it. Not only that, but the most important issue is that the only way any of us or all of us can get the coronavirus is that the staff and/or the free world people bring it to us. I know every time that it happens because we are all tested for the virus again and again. We may or may not be placed on a 14-day lock down. So not safe!</br></br> 3. What has it been like to have reduced visitations from family and loved ones?</br></br> Terrible, basically that by far was a blessing because I could spend some time with family and/or friends, eat some decent food, and feel like a human being again at least for a little while. Find out what's really happening out there in the “real world”. We don't have “reduced visitation”, we have “no visitation” for a very long time.</br></br> 

Now and every time my family and friends call up here and ask the question “when will visiting start again?” they're told “no, not this time, please keep on checking.” That's the answer that no one us want to hear.</br></br>       4. And how have you been coping with this crisis?</br></br> 
I've been trying to make the best of my time under these very limited options. OK. I've used the phone a lot more than I normally would. I'm writing more letters which my family and friends love getting. I even taken my time and did a “spring cleaning” of my locker, drawer, and common areas. I went through my property to decide what I really needed and what I did not through a process of elimination because I for one do not like any clutter and I am not a hoarder. That way my areas are clean and tidy which I love. I have also taken to read more books and watching more TV. Mostly the news because I'm very concerned about what is going on in the world that's now affecting all of us.
