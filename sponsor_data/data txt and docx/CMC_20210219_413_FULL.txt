Wash hands after handling. COVID-19.</br></br>

Dear PrisonPandemic:</br></br>

On the date of receipt of your letter (2/8/21), I was on quarantine due to having contracted COVID-19. I delayed answering your letter until I was off of quarantine, as I wanted to make certain I was not sending COVID-19 out with this letter. I hope the delay did not create an inconvenience. </br></br>

Before I go into the questions outlined in your letter, I want to make it clear that I am aware that people outside of prison have suffered far more than I have. I am aware that due to the pandemic people have lost their jobs, people have lost their businesses, people have lost their savings, I am certain many have concerns over how they will be able to feed their families. Of course people have lost family members to the virus and family members were not allowed to attend the funeral. I at least will be fed, no matter what and I will have a place to sleep.</br></br>

With all this said, I will answer some of your questions. In two months I will be 66 years old, so I have been concerned about contracting COVID-19. The answer to your question, no I do not and have not felt safe. One concern most inmates I have talked to is custody staff are, or appeared to be of the opinion that the inmate population are the carriers and spreaders of the virus. As you know, the only way, it can come into the institution is through those leaving and returning to the institution on a daily basis.</br></br>

As for visits, I have not had a visit in years. My relatives live out of state and cannot travel to California just to visit me. The last visit I had was with a friend who lived in this state; however, he passed away a couple of years ago. So the pandemic has not impacted me in this way.</br></br>

In May, 2020, this institution was placed on a modified program. I was not allowed to go to work after that. My job was a pay position ($36.00 a month), so I lost that income.</br></br>

While on quarantine I am restricted to my cell 24 hours a day. I am allowed a shower every other day and a phone call to family every two days. When not on quarantine the inmates where I am housed are allowed daily showers, daily phone calls and one hour on the yard. So, basically restricted to cells 23 hours a day.</br></br>

Second to having contracted COVID-19, the most traumatic impact the pandemic has had on me was the cancellation of my Board of Parole Hearing. I had a Board of Parole hearing scheduled for December 23, 2020. However, it was cancelled because the housing unit I lived in was on quarantine. I did not have COVID-19 at the time, but after the inmate population was tested on December 11, 2020, one inmate, out of about 290 inmates in the housing unit tested positive, the housing unit was placed on quarantine. On December 18, 2020, all the inmates in the housing unit, including me, tested negative for COVID-19.</br></br>

Up to and on December 23, 2020, I under the impression I would be going to the Board of Parole Hearing as scheduled. The Hearing was scheduled for 10:30 AM. At about 10:15 AM I asked a correctional officer to call the Board Room to see why I had not been called to the Board Room. When the correctional officer returned, he informed me the Hearing had been cancelled because “I” was on quarantine.</br></br>

Remember, I had tested twice and each teat was negative, during a two week period, the last test five days prior to my hearing. And after the test results from December 11, 2020, were returned on December 14th, 2020, indicating the one positive result for one inmate, I, as well as the other inmates in the housing unit, was placed on quarantine. So, I was isolated in my cell and provided a negative test a week after the test on December 11, 2020. In other words, there was no way I had COVID-19 on the date of my Board of Parole Hearing.</br></br> 

After the inmates in the housing unit were removed from quarantine, I had a conversation with a supervisor regarding my Board of parole Hearing on December 23, 2020 being cancelled. I was told the Board of Parole Hearing Commissioner would not hold the Hearing with me wearing a mask. Keep in mind, this was a virtual hearing. The room where the virtual hearing would be held is about 40 feet by 20 feet (at least).</br></br>

The only people actually in the room would be me two correctional officers and me. The room has windows that can be opened and is large enough the correctional officers could be at least 30 feet from me. Oh, by the way, the same officers who would search me, while I was wearing a mask, prior to me entering the room.</br></br>

The institution held the position that I could not take the mask off during the Hearing. Therefore, the Commissioner cancelled the Hearing. As of this date the Hearing has not been re-scheduled. In theory, my term in prison has been extended due to my being prevented from attending the Hearing on December 23, 2020, of course, this is contingent on me being found suitable for parole at that Hearing and Governor Newsom agreeing with that decision.</br></br> 

What I find ironic about this is a law recently passed in California, which advances Board of parole Hearings who are 50 years old and have served 15 years in prison. One of the reasons cited in the bill was COVID-19. So release people because of COVID-19 but do not hold the Hearings because of COVID-19.</br></br>

I hope this letter provides some information you were looking for. Thank you for your well wishes and encouragement. Stay Safe.</br></br> 

Best Wishes,</br></br>
