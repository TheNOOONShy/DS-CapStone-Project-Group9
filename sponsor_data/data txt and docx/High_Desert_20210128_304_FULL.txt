This letter was written by a person incarcerated at High Desert.</br></br>

I pray this reaches you and those closest to you safe and doing well in this new year. Thank you for reaching out to me! My experience during this pandemic has been very depressing and anxiety triggering.</br></br>

Around March 2020, is when the prison I was at went on modified program or COVID lockdown and stopped visits. I had just got to that prison (CSP Corcoran) six months (or so) prior to that and I had just received my first visit from my kids and their mother the weekend before the lockdown. Despite the rest of the state being closed, I and other inmates were transferred off that yard and sent to other prisons. I am from [redacted] and that is where my children and mother stay.</br></br> 

So it was not a ride around the corner for me to get visits while I was at Corcoran, but my family managed. I was then transferred to High Desert State Prison (Susanville, California) despite it being too far to receive visits, being in college at the time, and participating in various mental and self help groups (such as CGA), I was sent up here. Before I was transferred my kids and their mother got COVID and I couldn't even call.</br></br> 

That was maybe the most stressful and worried I have been my entire 10 years of incarceration. I have been here at HDSP for over six months and they will not honor the hardship that being so far from my family has created. I was moved to another yard because they said (I may have been exposed to) someone that had COVID while at the CTC. The thing that confused me was that I had went to CTC three days before they decided to quarantine me.</br></br>

I then sat in another building (on another yard) without talking to or hearing from my family for two weeks. The entire time I complied and took COVID tests and received negative results. The entire time they kept me in quarantine building and I was forced to use the same shower and reading materials as sick inmates. I eventually contracted COVID.</br></br> 

I have preexisting health care issues and this was not taken into consideration at all. The negligence I have been through and seen is inhumane. They still have not started video visits. They have not ran canteen for over two months. There are inmates who have had COVID housed with inmates who have not had it.</br></br> 

My family relationship has suffered greatly. I am sorry this is so sloppy, but thank you for contacting me.
