Hello PrisonPandemic,</br></br>


May the true blessing of the Creator be upon you in everything you do. Thank you for caring and writing to me, even though I do not know what you look like. It was truly sweet getting some mail. I am a Jamaican, I do not get too many mail.</br></br>


You did ask about the virus. They say I did got it but my feeling never change. I know one inmate who died. Inside here all they do is try to make lots of money by moving us around. Most of us have been moved 7 time or more and everywhere we go, everyone got the virus.</br></br>


Please take good care of yourself.</br></br>


Thank you very much for writing.
