This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Folsom.</br></br>
Because in prison,  the best scenario for me was to stay quarantined in a cell by myself, to insure that I could beat this thing. For this is a very very serious time in American history. There has never been such a heat wave as COVID-19. And, there is always going to be people out there with COVID-19. So, where do we go from here? The way it’s looking is, COVID-19 may cause mankind to become separatists to a degree. We’ll see the COVID vaccinations are going great in the prison. They’ve done a good job at keeping the inmate population from getting totally infected. Although, there were some cases on both sides.</br></br>
It was never able to get a foothold Because of the fast actions of the uppers running the prison. Now, in the ongoing part of this, I'm still pushing to free myself so I can get back into the streets and have a good life. I’m seeking out a good civil attorney to assist me in the endeavor. For, there is truly a lot to live for, even though COVID-19 is on site. One must remain optimistic as to the future. In seeking one day, to be truly happy again. In the land of the free and home of the brave. And, if you keep your mind right, God can help you! Thank you for this opportunity and God Bless!</br></br>
