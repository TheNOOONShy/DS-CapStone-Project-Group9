This story was told by a person incarcerated at New Folsom.</br></br>Caller: I said yeah, we got cops jumping on inmates and stuff. We got cops doing all types of foul play shit man and it's, ain't nothing we can do about it. If we fight em, we can fight them back but then they stick charges, "Oh man he hit us first," knowing that they lying.</br></br>Man, they hit you first. They literally swung first. And if there's cameras on the yard that saw it, all of a sudden they can't find the video. Knowing that the officer - so basically you facing another strike or in court looking at 25 to life because he swung first and he lying to save his ass.</br></br>

UCI: Wow.</br></br>Caller: And I know this COVID stuff been bringing stress on people. I know this COVID shit's been bringing stress on people but you got cops just jumping on inmates and stuff. And all they're doing, even if they find them at fault, the COs fault, and of course dismiss the case, all they doing is shuffling them cops around the state.</br></br>I don't know when it was the last time they fired a CO. It's been probably, it's been years probably since they did that. All they doing is, is if you got dirty, corrupt COs and stuff, all they do is shuffle them around, putting them in different prisons.</br></br>And they start up doing back at what they was doing in the same prisons. Jumping on inmates and all types of shit. And this is making it worser because it's COVID-19. And it's any type of mouth foul from any inmate, then they whooping your ass.</br></br>You in the hole with fucking swollen face, broken jaw, all types of shit, and looking at pinning charges from the county of Sacramento or wherever. I did seen them jump on hella inmates. This shit foul bruh.
