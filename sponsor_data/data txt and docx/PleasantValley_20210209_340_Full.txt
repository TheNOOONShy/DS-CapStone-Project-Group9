I’ve received a letter from you and PrisonPandemic Project. Hopefully if so you’ll receive mine. On my experience inside, prison has been a struggle during this pandemic. I’ve recently lost a family member, my mother in 2019.</br></br>

My cellmate is my twin brother. After our loss, we fell off when it came to a support system out there. I lost my ex-girlfriend also, as she left after my mom passed. So I literally had no one to help us from in here when this pandemic started. When people started getting infected, it spread like wildfire.</br></br>

I was in block cell. Everyone was infected with the virus. All around me and my brother. Sadly I wasn’t safe at all because they ended up using my cell block as a quarantine building. They didn’t move us away, but they kept us that weren’t infected inside the block. People got well past the virus. Some people didn’t.</br></br> 

But thank God, me and my brother never got the virus, God bless. Now we recently got the vaccine and moved from the block we were in. But still, we’re all alone in here with no family or friends on the outs. So every day’s a struggle in here.</br></br>

Knowing when you lose your only family, you lose everything. I take it day by day, a step to getting out soon. But it was hard and still is hard during this pandemic, with no one caring about you.</br></br> 

Thank you for reading if you ever get this letter. You can write me for more information.</br></br>

God bless.
