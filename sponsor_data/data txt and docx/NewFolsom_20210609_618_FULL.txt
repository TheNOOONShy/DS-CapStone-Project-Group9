This story was told by a person incarcerated at New Folsom.</br></br>

UCI: I have some questions that I can ask or if you just like to tell us your story, your - we can go either way?</br></br>

Caller: Okay, so, I was, you know, reading through Deuteronomy chapter 27 or 28, and I was reading one day and then I read across a scripture that came across some promises from God and some curses from God. But, I did not know that it would be meaningful. I didn't know that the next thing I noticed, that we had a world epidemic.</br></br>

So, now I'm like, dang, you know, I just read the Bible about this and it happened. So now I'm battling myself. I'm like, hold on, you know, is that a coincidence that I could just read that and it happen?</br></br>

And so, well, next what started happening, I started looking at myself and my identity towards God. And I was like, why does everything that I read or write seems to happen, like, in the same way that I wrote it or read it? So now I'm like, what is going on with me now?</br></br>

You know what I'm saying. So, I felt a little bit down. I was in my first prison riot last year and it was terrible. You know, it was over nothing.</br></br>

It was about one person slapping somebody, and then it was a race against another race, and I was like, I'm finding myself going backwards and going backwards. And then, I go to the hole, I'm in the hole, you know. I'm aching for another Bible, I'm looking for another Bible, you know what I'm saying, just to read to see where I'm at again, you know.</br></br>

So I get out of the hole and then I go back to the hole for something that happened with somebody else. Didn't have nothing to do with me, but they felt like I had something to do with it. And somebody end up getting hurt. So, now I'm back in the hole again for something I didn't do.</br></br>

I'm back pleading with God again. I'm like, man, I just need another chance. But then, by this time, they locked the prisons down. You know, we've been on lockdown for, like, a whole year now.</br></br>

Not like a total lockdown, like, you don't come out, but, like, use the phone, use the shower, and that's it. I mean, sometime we able to go outside, but that means we have to be on the yellow tier or the orange tier. One of those tiers that's less moderate, you know.</br></br>

And it got to the point where, you know, I broke down, you know, I was crying just today, you know, just saying a prayer. Man, you know, I know that God knows that I know he real. And I told him I know you're real, I know it's in my mind, I know it's in my heart.</br></br>

So, you know, this experience and many other ones like it, you know, it's driven me into, you know, not only telling my story but maybe telling somebody else or helping somebody else get they're story out. So, the more stories we get out, the more the world sees us as a whole instead of being divided in prison.</br></br>

Like a whole. It's a congregation of people trying to accomplish a mission that's positive. And that starts with conversations like these.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm. Well, I do appreciate you calling and tell us your story. I really do. Thank you so much for calling.</br></br>

So, you mentioned that you were only allowed to go out to go to the shower and to make phone calls. Is that still what's happening or are you able to go out more now?</br></br>

Caller: A little bit more now because of the vaccine shots, you know. All last year it's been like one of those sit down and, you know, we can't allow you guys to go to the yard, go outside and be around each other because they didn't know nothing about the vaccine. They didn't have a formula or nothing to, you know, give us no information about how to deal with this.</br></br>

So, yeah, it's pretty much we on and off, you know. If there's a case, if somebody catches it we're locked back down for two weeks, 14 days or 10 days, and then we off again after that person is tested negative. So, right now, I think we're all vaccinated at this prison, so there's not a lot of COVID-19 popping up. So, that's a good thing.</br></br>

So, you know, we got a couple more days on lockdown because they're doing a wide world search. And so, when that's up we'll be able to go outside and we have our full groups, our classes, we'll be able to do all the things we were doing before this happened.</br></br>

UCI: Will you be able to have visitations again when that happens, or are those still pushed until further notice?</br></br>

Caller: That I do not know, but I do know that certain prisons are letting some inmates use the video recorder, like a Skype or Facetime recording thing with their families. And we're just waiting to get our tablets so we can get that here. We're waiting on tablets to get – they're - statewide they're issuing, they're issuing out free tablets to each inmate.</br></br>

So, we'll be able to actually call or video call or send a video message or receive video message and e-mail. So, a lot of the information that you're getting will be, pretty soon you'll get e-mail. And it'll be a faster approach to getting information expressed to the world or however, you know.</br></br> 

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br> 

Caller: So, yeah, but the visits, they're shut down right now because right now we a statewide lockdown. We on a - this is called a modified program. And when you're on modified program they're not going to allow you to go and get a visit when they're searching.</br></br>

Because any time they conduct a search there's no movement. Everything's got to get searched, everybody's got to get searched, nobody moves, no transferring. None of that. Nothing. And you could probably understand why.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm. So, how long does that take? So, is it just, like, one day thing?</br></br>

Caller: That takes 14 days statewide.</br></br>

UCI: Oh, okay.</br></br>

Caller: Every prison, every prison for the last, I'd say, week and a half, we've been on lockdown. But, we come out on the weekends.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br> 

Caller: We come out Friday and Saturday on the weekends. But, that's only for the buildings that's being searched. The ones that has not been searched, they don't go outside.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm. Okay.</br></br>

Caller: Unless you in the hole, and even then, if it's your day to get searched, you don't come out – well, you do actually- actually, when you go in the hole you do go outside. 

You have to go outside so your cell can get searched. And they crack all the doors open in the area, and they crack – on every tier, every door comes open, everybody goes outside to get searched.</br></br> 

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br> 

Caller: So, it can be a good thing, you know. But, when you go back to your cell and you find all your stuff, you know, pictures and everything get took off the wall, and different things that, you know, they don't allow, you kind of get upset. But, you know, it's okay. You know, at least that's over with for this year.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, definitely. How have you been – oh, sorry?</br></br>

Caller: They do it once a year.</br></br>

UCI: Oh, okay. Is it at the same time every year?</br></br>

Caller: Huh?</br></br>

UCI: Is it at the same time every year or is it just some random time throughout?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, around about the spring, early summer.</br></br>

UCI: Did they still do it last year because of COVID, or did they not do it?</br></br>

Caller: They did it. They're required to do that every year.</br></br>

UCI: Oh, okay. So, how have you been coping with the crisis? I know you mentioned that you've been reading the Bible more and praying a lot more, but is there anything else that you've been able to do to help you cope?</br></br>

Caller: I exercise. And that is good. I meditate. I meditate and I do prayer and I watch TV.</br></br>

I play dominoes with my celly and, you know, I get out and use the phone. And I make sure that everything is okay with my mind, with my doctors, you know. And I just try to stay positive, you know.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm. Well, I think we're about to get cut off. I wanted to thank you for calling us and participating in PrisonPandemic. If you have any friends that would like to call, like, feel free to give them our number and they can call or write us a letter, as well.</br></br>

If you had more you wanted to say feel free to call us back at any time Monday through Friday from 5:00 to 9:00 p.m. Could even call back after this if you had something else you wanted to say. But, thank you so much for calling.</br></br>

Caller: All right, thank you so much.</br></br>

UCI: Thank you, bye-bye.</br></br>

Caller: Bye-bye.
