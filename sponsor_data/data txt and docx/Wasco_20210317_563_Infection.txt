This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Wasco.</br></br>Well you ask me what my experiences inside during this time? Well let me start by saying it all began at county of [redacted], I caught COVID-19 inside the jail. People started getting sick before the President had made announcement to the country. This was on May 7, 2020 I caught COVID.</br></br> Then two county sheriff’s die that work at the jail. Then three inmate die too. I was so scared. They took me to Barring for quarantine. It was the worst two week of my life. I was isolation for two people would come in space suit to feed me and take my temperature every six hour.</br></br> I could sleep. I couldn’t eat. I just wonder if I would ever see my family again, my kids, my mom, and family, till this day I think I got PTSD. I still can’t sleep at night that just thinking of I’m going to wake up. It’s pretty frightening, or when I hear people cough my mind thinks of COVID.</br></br>There not one that goes by that I might get it again airborne.  It’s been very hard in here to cope with this pandemic. During this time in here it’s cold, ugly and pretty sad. You have to be strong minded to cope with the situation in here. I feel there no safety inside here again and airborne virus or new strain virus like COVID-19, or some more.</br></br>
