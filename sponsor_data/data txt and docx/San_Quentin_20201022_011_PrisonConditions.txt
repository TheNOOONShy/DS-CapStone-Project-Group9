Good men have died here in San Quentin State Prison, and COVID-19 still lingers, difficulties and danger. On October 21, 2020, on KRON Channel 4 News at 6 a.m., it was verified by CDCR San Quentin officials.</br></br>
They said, "We have done everything possible to prevent the outbreak of COVID-19 and protect the general population." These words are blasphemous and not true. I have known several good men who should have been paroled, elderly men, years ago. However, tragically, they perished from COVID-19. Today, here in West Block, at approximately 4:46 p.m., there was an announcement made that three men were to pack their property, TV, shower shoes, hygiene, and bedroll to be relocated.</br></br>
In addition, North Block unit is back in quarantine. The overcrowding here in San Quentin still looms where a social distancing at six feet remains futile. This unit is filthy, and also low humidity hovers in the atmosphere due to poor ventilation. With the flu season on the horizon, my personal health, life, and safety, along with the correctional staff, is in jeopardy and uncertain./br></br>
I am 62 years old with hypertension, who has served 27 years of incarceration, only now prone to die for the deliberate indifference caused by CDCR.</br></br>
