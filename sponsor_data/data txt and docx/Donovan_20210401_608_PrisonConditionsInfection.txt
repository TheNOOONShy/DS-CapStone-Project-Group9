So your first question what has it been like during the COVID-19 pandemic? Well let me tell you being in prison sucks. So heres my story: I was transferred from Sierra Conservation Center in Jamestown to San Quentin State prison in June 2020 I was placed in the hole “ad-seg” as I was “quarantined” for 14 days. This was during the time when C.D.C.R. had transferred 15 inmates from Chino prison and some of those inmates were infected with COVID therefore spreading the virus from prison to prison.</br></br> 


So Im sure you have heard on the news about San Quentin and the outbreak. Well I was there! For five months! Okay when I found out that I was trapped in San Quentin with COVID there was only over 100 cases of COVID in my unit Carson section. Quickly within a few months it went to 600 then 1500 then over 2600 inmates infected with 26 inmates dead and one sergeant from the prison dead.</br></br> 


I actually was so scared and lucky that I did not get the virus because I never came out of my cell I refused to move and got a write up for refusing to house then it was my fan that saved me. I tied my fan to the bars of the cell and blew all the negative air out of my cell. I put newspaper and the lower half of my bars to block germs and hung up sheets on the top just my fan blew out air. I washed up in my cell instead of going out to the shower I cleaned my walls floor sink and toilet and clothes daily and luckily I did not contract COVID.</br></br> 


At the same time San-Quentin is a very dirty mice running around and the guards failed to separate the infected inmates that’s why 2600 people got COVID there. Anyway the end of September of 2020 I was transferred from San Quentin to Valley State Prison in Chowchilla I was so happy to get away from San Quentin what a dump. And let me tell you the guards and CDCR are lazy and crooked they don’t care about us.</br></br> 


Okay I got transferred to Valley State Prison and I was there from the end of September then at the end of November I got infected with COVID-19. Oh by the way Valley State Prison and eight men pods where San Quentin was cells. Anyway I was in a small pod or dorm with seven other inmates when one guy infected us all. I then was moved 11 times in Valley State within two months!!</br></br>


How unprofessional Valley State Prison is! They shuffled us around like sardines or goldfish in a tank… I went from B yard Bldg 3 -- to A yard Bldg. 3 -- then back to B yard Bldg 4 -- then to the gym -- then back to B yard Bldg 4 -- then to B-yard Bldg 1 -- then to C yard bldg 4 -- then back to B yard Bldg. 3. Valley State Prison is so unprofessional in their ways of dealing with sick people! Luckily, I did not get too sick just loss of energy, chills and flu-like symptoms.</br></br> 


Anyway I never got evaluated by a doctor just temperature checks and blood pressure. No Tylenol or Motrin. Valley State Prison really sucks. I actually went on suicide watch to get away from people.
