This letter was written by a person incarcerated at CMC (California Men's Colony).</br></br>

With the country divided, many people’s viewpoints have been made clear. The same has been done in CMC. That viewpoint is that we inmates are less than human and don't matter. I've witnessed firsthand this virus be weaponized and used towards us. Of course, not seeing my family on visits hurts, but being targeted by the ones who are paid to keep us safe is even more unsettling.</br></br> 

When the pandemic first arrived inmates were given cheap masks made of cloth, although they inform Sacramento we are wearing N95 mask. Then masks were rarely worn by staff and only used as another excuse to harass verbally and physically inmates not wearing them properly. Guards have been heard making comments like “I don't need one if my president doesn't” and “It’s  not killing my people so why should I care?”</br></br> 

Inmates like myself who have written 602s demanding staff wear masks have been met with hostility and retribution.</br></br> 

My yard starting off I was lucky to initially miss the first outbreak. An inmate was brought from the hole who told the guards “I have COVID and tested positive.” The guards ignored him, letting him go free on the yard and in the building. Days later the entire yard was infected. Instead of quarantining, inmates were mixed into other buildings infecting the rest of the population.</br></br> 

Multiple people have died. Including two close friends of mine.</br></br> 

On top of that, the pandemic has been used as an excuse to serve us depleted rations of food throughout the day. My only form of coping with school, emails, and phone calls. Not even emails are being delivered weeks after being sent, with regular mail falling months behind. Focusing on school and my faith and family have been the only light at the end of this dark tunnel.</br></br> 

It's been hard to believe that this is the treatment mental health prisoners receive.
