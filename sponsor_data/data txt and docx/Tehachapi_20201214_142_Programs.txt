I write music. I play guitar. I sing. I attend college. I exercise. I take self-help courses. I read. I meditate. I practice yoga. I pray. I write. I write books. I train twice a week, four hours total, for my new job assignment (PWMP), orchestrated by Governor Newsom.</br></br>

I think that maybe I should write a book on COVID-19 2020. If anyone at your organization would like to team up with me on it... I will fit it in my schedule to do so please let me know. I'll write the book, I just need help from someone to publish it.</br></br>

I have so much to narrate about COVID-19 in prison till it will burn your ears and baffle your mind. Please excuse my penmanship. I usually type. I did not take out my personal typewriter because my cellmates are asleep.</br></br>

I think that I will write some positive songs in the country music genre about COVID-19 because the world needs uplifting.</br></br>

I will take up learning karate and Spanish for my second language within two weeks. I signed up for 21 credits for spring semester 2021. I completed 19 credits for six college classes for this fall semester 2020. I think that I earned all As.
