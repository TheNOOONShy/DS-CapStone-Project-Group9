This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Tehachapi.</br></br>

Your hope was fulfilled because your message found me whole. It is our reactions to the different and difficult seasons in our lives that speak volumes on your character. We, as a world, did not have a choice in COVID-19 thrashed poverty upon us.</br></br>

COVID-19 is a modern-day monster. Its mission is to destroy. One thing about life is that it keeps changing for everyone slightly differently. We don’t always get what we want, but we get what we need. It’s so true.</br></br>

I extend my appreciation for you taking the time or making the time to contact me in this prison system. It is big of you to voice that you are thinking about me and hoping everyone and I get through this challenge. You stand tall!</br></br>

It is special that you are part of a team at UCI, collecting stories about what has been happening inside facilities during the COVID pandemic.</br></br>

My experiences: I and others deeply accepted the thought that the whole COVID-19 was a hoax. Lo and behold, it turned out to be the real Frankenstein, the Grim Reaper. Our programs were limited and adversely shutdown in April 2020. Visiting came to a complete halt. People on my left and people on my right tested positive for COVID-19. They were separated and quarantined. It went on and on without an end in sight. There were no demises here as far as I recollect. I could be wrong.</br></br>

There were 800 inmates on this yard. Now, there are only 299 inmates. 500 inmates paroled or were early released because COVID-19 expedited it. Some people in prison maybe should not have been in prison in the first place so they were lucky to leave prison early. Prison is a hell.</br></br> 

I was in college working on my eighth degree (AIA). When COVID-19 shut down our college program in person. The community college converted or switched to distance learning. We kept on trucking. I was able to obtain my AIA sociology. I should have 15 AIA degrees by February 2020. I have completed the work at Cerro Coso College fall semester 2020.</br></br>

I feel there is no way they can advocate or practice six feet social distance in prison because it is not humanly possible. We were issued two orange masks made of jacket cloth by the PIA. I wash them daily. It’s mandatory that we wear them at all times except in your living area.</br></br>

I think it was a smart thing for the prison to stop all visits because it saved lives, I know.</br></br>

I write music. I play guitar. I sing. I attend college. I exercise. I take self-help courses. I read. I meditate. I practice yoga. I pray. I write. I write books. I train twice a week, four hours total, for my new job assignment (PWMP), orchestrated by Governor Newsom.</br></br>

I think that maybe I should write a book on COVID-19 2020. If anyone at your organization would like to team up with me on it... I will fit it in my schedule to do so please let me know. I'll write the book, I just need help from someone to publish it.</br></br>

I have so much to narrate about COVID-19 in prison till it will burn your ears and baffle your mind. Please excuse my penmanship. I usually type. I did not take out my personal typewriter because my cellmates are asleep.</br></br>

I think that I will write some positive songs in the country music genre about COVID-19 because the world needs uplifting.</br></br>

I will take up learning karate and Spanish for my second language within two weeks. I signed up for 21 credits for spring semester 2021. I completed 19 credits for six college classes for this fall semester 2020. I think that I earned all As.</br></br>

I will type some COVID-19 prison stories for you within two weeks. So tell me about you.</br></br>

I have written four books:</br></br>

1. Baker’s Weight Loss System</br></br>

2. Purple Weight Loss Book</br></br>

3. President Donald Trump, Just the Facts</br></br>

4. 100,000 Affirmations</br></br>

The publisher returned them to me when COVID-19 struck and went out of business. It’s a real bummer!</br></br>

I stand to render you some good COVID-19 stories, essays, what have you. Write to me ASAP!
