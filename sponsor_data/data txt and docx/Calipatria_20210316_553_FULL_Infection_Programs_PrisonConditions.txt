Greetings.</br></br>

I pray that you and your family is well through all that has transpired through the COVID virus.</br></br>

It’s apparent that many officials had dropped the ball countless of times as we now suffered half a million deaths in our country alone.</br></br>

Please excuse the lapse in me responding back. I have to admit I was told that I came in contact in January the first of the year and had to quarantine myself (in which I did). I’m daily engulfed in my independent studies, my judicial studies, academic studies, and my first book in which I’m only halfway through! So I’m extremely busy!</br></br>

I currently hold a cruel and inhumane punishment of 469 years to life for taking money- no one was hurt or injured in any way- and so my challenges are phenomenal! Apparently, laws are changing- so I’m blessed in that area!</br></br>

There’s great deal that goes on inside of prison!</br></br>

Some complex</br></br>

Some politics</br></br>

Some ignorance</br></br>

Some- or should I say a great deal of arrogance!</br></br>

The COVID disease and how it was handled in this prison was a disaster!</br></br>

They did not know what to do! As a result everybody was infected! By the grace of God- many of us are still alive! And I pray that you and your family and friends are still alive!</br></br>

God bless, take care. Thank you for your letter.</br></br>

Respectfully.
