This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Wasco.</br></br>

I'm one of the people that had COVID in jail it sucks because these CO’s (Correctional Officer) don't want to get closer to you because they’re not trying to get it at the same time spread it so program and visitation gets cut more so there’s less action to get in touch with your people and you don't wanna tell your family either because you don't want them to worry about you knowing they got everyone in the streets to worry about so yeah I gets pretty hectic.</br></br>

I'm not gonna get into details on how bad I got COVID but it was pretty bad and just know we don't get the treatment like in a hospital so everyone in the streets have it pretty good I know some might say well we put ourself in here. Yeah you’re right but man we’re not trying to die knowing some of us have a release date to go home.</br></br>

You also ask what I feel about my safety well Ima say I have no safety concerns but people get stabbed beat up almost everyday so its kind of normal in prison so Ill be more worried about the prison lifestyle then getting COVID so safety concerns are good nothing to be worried about so everything is a trip.</br></br>
