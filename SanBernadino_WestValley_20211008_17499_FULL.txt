UCI: How are you doing tonight?</br></br>

Caller: I'm pretty good. It's been a rough day. We've had a lot of fistfights in the pod. I'm at West Valley. This is the closest I've been to COVID during the whole pandemic, being in jail.</br></br>

It seems like we're being subjected to COVID. We're not forced to wear masks in our pod. And the only time we have to have one is when we leave the door and go outside, to a doctor or to court.</br></br>

If we go outside to the day room, on the outside — we have an outside day room - to get some fresh air, we don't have to wear them out there. We don't have to wear masks on the inside. I've witnessed our toilets be filled to the brim for over a week with poop overflowing onto the floor, or the men were pooping in the shower in order to have a place to go.</br></br> 

I reported that to the doctor. It took another about five days before they come and cleaned it up. They finally got the toilets working again, but that was quite a nightmare.</br></br>

And on a daily basis, they bring new inmates in. And we don't know where they come from, and they're not wearing a mask when they come in, and it just kind of seems ridiculous that - that we have this going on, and we're not being protected. I try to wear a mask at all times when I'm inside here just to avoid everybody else so that I don't catch it.</br></br> 

I have tested negative three or four times. I've been beaten severely while I've been inside the jail. And I've been hauled to the hospital twice now and had a four-inch needle stuck in my arm yesterday for the fracture in my right rotator cuff.</br></br>

I moved to California in - I was awaiting a double homicide trial for identified  in the stabbing - I saw a cell phone underneath the porch that night leaving a blue glow.</br></br>

I reported that to the officers when they arrived while I was trying - trying to save a life which I used my EMT, Boy Scout, All America save skills to save her life from what she received that night. The cell phone led to a search warrant of a person's home where police found a dissolving in a vat of acid in the - in their basement. Was at the time on - when she stabbed.</br></br>

Both were found guilty on - and sentenced to two life sentences plus 60 years for the murders of the fatal stabbing of - I was living in seclusion in - awaiting that trial.</br></br> 

When the owners of the - approached me and entered the property, trespassing and demanded my phone number and started threatening me with arrest if I would not provide them a phone number and my identification. I was able to give them my phone number, but I hid my name.</br></br>

Both placed threats on me and then filed a fictitious restraining order upon me to force the removal from me on that property in which they did not own. I learned all of this information later on, not knowing the better. Both parties had then swindled the-</br></br>

They then made a phoney power of attorney to move the deeds into the - I need help reporting a fictitious business on this. Had been some several legal problems several months ago, and they hadn't reported the property as possession income.</br></br>

Then stalked me and forced me to relocate five times during the COVID-19 lockdown. Each parties have multiple protection orders against each other — out on each other. And that is out of the court system.</br></br>

UCI: Hello? Can you hear me? If you can hear me, I, unfortunately, cannot hear you anymore, so I'm gonna hang up, and if you want, you can call back.</br></br>

It just cut right off and then — oh, oh - there we go. Wait, I can hear you now.</br></br>

Caller: Okay.</br></br>

UCI: There we go.</br></br>

Caller: Where did it cut off? Did they shut me off or what? They don't want me to give the information out?</br></br>

UCI: No, I think it—</br></br>

Caller: This is really, this is really-</br></br>

UCI: Sometimes it cuts off. Sometimes the signal has been cutting off when I'm on phone calls. It just goes silent sometimes, but I can hear you now.</br></br>

Caller: Okay. I have no idea where I ended. Can I start over?</br></br>

UCI: The last thing I remember you saying was about - that was the last word I remember.</br></br>

Caller: Okay. Let's see if I can find — I've got it all written down here.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, there we go.</br></br>

Caller: Can you still hear me?</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, I can still hear you.</br></br>

Caller: That - that was some interruption again. So, I have yet to meet my public defender on these matters, and I harshly doubt that COVID-19 has anything to do with that. My test is negative four times since I've been here, and I've been to - twice now for the beating that I took on-</br></br> 

And I broke my right rotator cuff for no reason whatsoever, but somebody wanted their phone number they had given me back. I've got - I had a four-inch needle stuck in my arm yesterday to have some medicine put in my arm. My right shoulder is completely shattered.</br></br>

I was the architect on the Yacht Club and I won The Street of Dreams. And in the restraining order it says that I'm ruthless — very ruthless, but I've been a Christian since 1968. That's all I have. This is kind of a crazy situation we're under here.</br></br>

I've - most of the men that are in here don't know how to get ahold of their lawyer. They have no public defender numbers. They cannot obtain those public defender numbers unless someone brings one back from the court.</br></br>

And as soon as we post it, they come and erase it and take it down. They don't want us to have information so we can connect with our public defenders. Those who are lucky enough to have one we call the public defenders and it's pretty rare that they even answer the phone.</br></br>

So, I don't know what is going on with the state system, but it seems to be quite a farce, and I don't understand why these men cannot get any help. I'm in jail here with a 33-year-old man who lives in an - brain. He was in a head-on collision when he was - his mother died in that car crash.</br></br> 

He has been in jail for now, awaiting trial. He's never met his attorney.</br></br>

And I've seen him be — he came to — he has been delayed three times now while he has been to court. They keep continuing him on. And that's the most case with everybody. They're being continued on.</br></br>

And I see - clearly see that there are several men in here that aren't guilty of anything and shouldn't be here. If we could just get an attorney to come and see us, it would be nice. I think that's all I have. Thank you.</br></br>

UCI: Okay. Thank you so much for sharing your story.</br></br>

Caller: I appreciate it.</br></br>
