This story was told by a person incarcerated at an ICE/Private-Contractor facility.</br></br>

UCI: Oh, I understand, I understand. Is there anything else you want to share about your experience?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, yeah, I don't know, I guess, you know, if anybody can bring this to higher grounds as far as, you know, health and safety and what not and just have them overlook this facility and what not and see if they're in regulations and all of that due to the unequalness and unfairness of other people's health and safety. And we're not getting no visits, we're not getting anything, and it's pretty crazy.</br></br>

UCI: So, your facility isn't doing a good job in keeping you guys sanitary, it sounds like.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, not so much. This COVID virus is going around â€“ this whole jail's pretty much almost got it. It's an outbreak, it's huge.</br></br>

UCI: Wow. That's horrible.
