This story was told by a person incarcerated at Chuckawalla.</br></br> 
UCI: To start off, what facility are you calling from?</br></br>Caller: Chuckawalla Valley State Prison.</br></br> UCI: Okay. So why don’t you tell me a little about the COVID-19 situation at your facility.</br></br>Caller: Yeah, we were unexposed right here. We were okay, about what four weeks ago, one month ago. All of a sudden some individual got infected and then all of us that wasn’t infected got moved to other facilities where people were infected.</br></br>Also over here, there’s no social distancing, people live really close with less than six feet away from each other.</br></br>

UCI: Mhmm.</br></br>

Caller: Less than six feet away from each other. It's just, the conditions are really, really, really, really bad. And when somebody gets also sick, you know they don’t have- provide the medical assistance that we are supposed to get. I don't know what kind of protocol are they following, but it’s just not working.</br></br> 

You know, officers over here are letting come, all the guys, all the individuals from other buildings to our building. It’s no control over that. I was one of the ones who was infected, and still they put me with people that weren’t infected.</br></br> 

I have a, I am a high-risk person, and I never got moved from this prison or, to go to another place. Based on a- they couldn’t do any movements at the time, unless you don’t do any movements, so a lot of us right here feel that our lives were put, you know, at risk you know and our lives were-</br></br>UCI: Yeah.</br></br>Caller:-exposed to, you know, the dangers. Yeah. So, I wasn’t happy with that. I’m not happy with that. Right now after we were in quarantine, we came back to the same building, but still no, I don’t see too many precautions.</br></br>

Everything is still the same. Actually they had stopped us from doing recreational activities. You know there’s nothing going on right now. School has stopped, the programs stopped, everything has stopped. And I do understand that but-</br></br>UCI: How long has programming been cut for?</br></br>Caller: Since it started, since COVID started. It was four or five months ago. Six months ago.</br></br>UCI: Wow.</br></br>Caller: Yeah so, the ones that we go to college, we still doing college through mail. But the ones who used to go to vocational, they are not doing anything right now. And let’s say, we did stop going with the other buildings, to have dinner or breakfast. Other than that, it’s just not safe over here.</br></br>UCI: Yeah.</br></br> Caller:  It’s just, no like I said no social distancing. Showers, we are, we still shower you know six, 10 people every shower, and it's like two, three feet away from them. When we go to dinner, you know, we have the tables right there together, you know like what four feet away from each other.</br></br> UCI: Yeah.</br></br>Caller: People per table, I guess. It’s just, somebody has to come and check what’s going on because this is not right.</br></br> UCI: Yeah, what do you think specifically they’ve done wrong, or, you know, how would you do it differently?</br></br> Caller: Keeping the social distancing, keeping us, well let's say, before we got infected, or actually after we got infected that's when we got the N-95, the masks, yeah. They should have given that to us from the very very beginning.</br></br> I know for a fact that there is a memo in the internet that was provided to us and they have a protocol to follow and one of the sections that I remember seeing, reading, is this right there, when a person gets infected, the building- the person gets moved from the building and the whole building does quarantine.</br></br>Well, nothing happened over here. We actually stayed over here and then the two, like I said, two out of five facilities where people were infected. Also it says right there, in the protocol that the staff is not supposed to move from building to building, or from yard to yard. Over here, they are switching from building to building, yard to yard.</br></br>  

You know, over time and stuff like that. When it says right there we no moving staff from that building.</br></br> UCI: Right.</br></br>Caller: They say, you know when they are supposed to work right there so they don’t go to other buildings. And that is not true, you know, they keep moving, you know, to other buildings. Like I say, they shouldn’t ban, like they should have checked from the beginning to the officers, and say, “You know what we are going to need your help right now, I don't know- we don’t know how long it's going to be this, how long it's going to last.”</br></br> UCI: Yeah.</br></br> Caller: “So we are going to stay here, you guys try to stay away from your families, stay away from other people and we are going to keep working.” But no, you know all the staff kept going back to their houses, exposing their family also, and we don’t get sick just because. We get sick because the staff brings this stuff over here.</br></br>  

UCI: Mhmm.</br></br> 

Caller: Because there is no way we could have gotten infected just because.</br></br>  You know, like I said, our building was, our yard was the last yard that got infected, and that was like four, yeah, about a month ago. It’s just not, not right, you know.</br></br>  UCI: Yeah, it sounds like they kind of did everything wrong.</br></br> Caller: Yes, three people, two people that I know died from my building. And I don’t know how many they are expecting, you know, or what they gonna do, you know. Everything is still the same. They keep switching officers. They keep sending back home, you know, coming back over here. It's just going to keep doing the same, it's going to be the same cycle.</br></br>  UCI: Yeah.</br></br> Caller: When is it going to stop? After they stop bringing them over here, or checking them. You know, and if they feel sick they should say something, “You know what, I don’t feel good. You know, I can’t go to work.” So hopefully they can do something about it also.</br></br> UCI: Yeah. Is there, do you feel that other people, you know, share your perspective, other people inside with you I mean?</br></br> Caller: Sure. Yeah, it’s a lot. There’s a lot.</br></br>  UCI: What do you think is, what do you think is next for, you said you don’t see this stopping anytime soon. Do you think it's gonna get worse?</br></br> Caller: If they don’t do anything about it, social distancing that they supposed to do, or changing the way they are supposed to do, or stop bringing, you know switching officers from one yard to another yard, I don’t know what's going to happen next time because right now we’re part of the first wave. So they say we are going to be okay for 90 days, but after that we don’t know what's going to happen.</br></br> UCI: Yeah.</br></br> Caller: It could be worse, it could be, who knows? There has to be a change. Yes.</br></br>  UCI: So they suspended programming, and made some other changes, it sounds like. I know those tends to be, you know something akin to a comfort to people inside. How are people coping with all of these changes and all of the added stress?</br></br> Caller: Well we all got to get better because, in a way that we, all of us understand what’s going on. And all of us are trying to protect ourselves. But all of us try to help each other over here. But, I don’t know what's going to happen after Monday, because like I said, they stopped recreation okay.</br></br> 

Meaning no more soccer, no more basketball, no more handball, no more sports.</br></br> UCI: Yeah.</br></br> Caller: All types of sports. But what are we going to do? Walk around the track, or you know, people’s gonna be stressing. You know, there’s gonna be another, there has to be another way because, I don’t know, I see our people united more. That’s what I’m trying to tell you.</br></br>  UCI: Yeah.</br></br> Caller: I see our people together more, you know, trying to, you know our goal is to stop, for them not to have the same officers going back home, going to the streets and then come back over here. You know if they switch that, if they change that, it might help. Or, if they feel sick, like I say, they should say and report it, “I don’t feel good you know, I don’t need to go to work," you know.</br></br>  UCI: So, with this sort of organization, you know, the togetherness-</br></br> Caller: No. Oh no.</br></br>  UCI: No? They’re not listening to you, huh?</br></br> Caller: Yeah, if you have any chance to check the website that they have over here, maybe you can download what they have for what they are supposed to do. But you will see, that it's not happening.</br></br>     UCI: Yeah.</br></br> Caller: That’s the problem that we have over here, that you know they can post whatever, they can post out there, but the reality is something else.</br></br>  UCI: Is there anything that you want, you know, the people listening to this, to know about?</br></br> Caller: That not because we made a mistake, we supposed to be, you know, live in cruel conditions. You know we are still human beings and we came for something. I understand that. And we’re trying our best over here.</br></br>  

Not because of that, we supposed to forget the individual as a person, because we were part of society also. And treating us the way we treat- we are still humans.</br></br>  You know and just have a little bit of consideration about us, you know, because we do have sick people over here. We do have people that have other medical issues and they don’t pay attention to them, or to us. So if change can be made medically, that'd be great also.</br></br>  UCI: Yeah. Thank you very much. I appreciate all your insight. If anyone else, if anyone else is there and they want to call in make sure they get this number. Okay.</br></br>  Caller: Yes, yes I will tell them.</br></br>  UCI: Alright, we really appreciate it.</br></br> Caller: Alrighty then. Thank you. Have a good night.</br></br>  UCI: Have a good night. Thank you.
