We Can’t See/Visit Our Family, Or Call When We Want. Let’s Get J-Pay To Put In Their Kiosks And Tablets In Place So We Can E-Mail When We Want, Receive Photos of Our Families. People Are Dying. Some Family Members Only Hope To See One Another Before Passing. That’s So Sad! I’m Losing Family Members To Covid-19 And I Can’t See Them? I Can’t Call Them @ The Hospital On Their Death Bed. But Only If I Could Send A Text To Help My Family Get Strong. It’s Possible, But We Need J-Pay Tablets To Do So.
By The Way, J-pay Tablets Give Us Something To Do In Our Cells, Gives Us More Incentives To Continue To Program. Screw CDCR Wanting A Percentage Of The E-Mails. That’s The Reason I Can’t Comfort My Loved On Via Text Message While She/He Is Dying From Covid-19? Where’s The Compassion In That? Yet, The Board Of Parole Terms Ask Us About Remorse, Sympothy And Insight? What A Joke! Lead By Example!!!
