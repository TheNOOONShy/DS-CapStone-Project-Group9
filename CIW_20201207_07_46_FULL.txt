This story was told by a family member of someone incarcerated at CIW (California Institution for Women).</br></br>

UCI: So, tell me your story. Do you - are you currently at a facility? Do you have family members at a facility?</br></br>

Caller: Yes, I have a mother incarcerated and-</br></br>

UCI: Okay. What facility is she at?</br></br>

Caller: She is in Corona- I mean California Institution for Women.</br></br>

UCI: Oh, perfect. Okay. So tell me your story. So, how long has she been there?</br></br>

Caller: So, I have been visiting her for about, I would say, 20 years, more or less, since I was little. And, you know, everything has been fine with visiting. And, you know, up until coronavirus we had a SHU visit scheduled, me and my family members, I have a brother.</br></br>

UCI: When was that scheduled for? Can I ask what relative month that was scheduled for?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah. It was, I believe, April 8th.</br></br>

UCI: Okay, okay.</br></br>

Caller: Or I think it was March 8th. I'm not sure. It was either one of those two months.</br></br>

UCI: It was early on.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah. Basically, it was right before coronavirus started like shutting everything down and, I guess - I mean, it was like right after. So, right after the coronavirus started shutting everything down. I guess they said we couldn't, you know, go to the SHU visit and we had ordered food like a whole box.</br></br>

And you know, you have to order it by a certain date. And we had ordered it by that certain date. And because of coronavirus they didn’t, you know, we didn't get that box. We still haven't had word on that box, and we spent like, I’m not, I don't really remember how much we spent but it was a lot of money. It was like in the hundreds, like a couple hundred at least. And we never got anything like, you know, no like, money back or nothing for that box.</br></br>

And I don't know if they're putting it on hold, but I don't know when the next time I'm going to see her ‘cause I haven't seen her since then. And I haven't even been able to see her like in person, which really sucks.</br></br>

UCI: Absolutely. Oh, continue. Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: Also, there was, she was able, we just had a lot more communication when we were able to visit, and now we don't.</br></br>

UCI: So, before COVID how were you guys communicating? Were there more phone calls, more letters, were you able to have more visitation? Kind of describe how it evolved. And then if you wouldn't mind also, when you describe it go into like the communication you've received from, you know, the prison itself on how your mom's doing and things like that.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, there was also, so, pretty much, she was into prison. So, the first prison was, you know, that was like a whole different story but the most recent one that she has been in, the visitation was frequent. You know, I went from like seeing her very like rarely to, I don't even know if that’s a word. I'm sorry. </br></br>

UCI: That’s okay. </br></br>

Caller: But I didn't see her that often. But I started seeing her more, and more, and more, you know like because she was closer. She went to the California Institution for Women. And that's like in Corona, or Chino. 

UCI: Mmhmm </br></br>

Caller: And like It's closer to me, so I was able to visit her. And I was able to see her like probably three times a month, twice a month.</br></br>

And it was like, it was good. They weren't that strict. And I had those family visits, which is, I would spend like a whole weekend with her. And that was really fun because we got to be in the same house and for the first time like ever, that I could ever remember, like in my whole life, I got to like, you know be in a house with her, which is cool.</br></br> 

UCI: Mmhmm. </br></br>

Caller: And, yeah. So, after that like you know, just, and you know,  we like, we had phone calls, obviously, and letters. But when coronavirus happened like the phone calls, at the time, they put them like on lockdown.</br></br>  

And they weren't able to really call for a couple of days. I think she wasn't able to. And then she, they started like, I guess they started quarantining some of the inmates. And my mom had a roommate who had gotten sick, so they quarantined my mother and that roommate.</br></br>

And so, I remember for that time I wasn't able to talk to her. And that was kind of hard. But one thing is that they do have Jpay, which is like an app, I guess, where I can email her. But obviously like, our first service like really was bad. She would email me and then I would get it like hours later. Sometimes the next day.</br></br>

I have to pay for every stamp that I use, like you know, it's like I had to pay for like a little package deal. So, I have to pay to talk to her. And I have to pay for all the phone calls, which, when I was little I don't remember doing that. But I don't know. Maybe it’s because i was little.</br></br>

UCI: That's interesting. What have you heard? Is there, how I would say - so, how average weekly - yeah and how often do you talk to your mom? Like if you were to give an average ballpark of how often you're able to speak to your mother over the phone or via email, how often do you think that would be per week?</br></br>

Caller: So, through the phone I would say it's like three times a week, and through emailing it's like more of an everyday thing, kind of like once a day. Like one to two emails a day, cause sometimes they are still slow. So you know, by the time I reply she can't. And she has like controlled times when she can use it.</br></br>

So, it's the only way I can talk to her and stuff like that. But it just really sucks because I find that the hardest part is our relationship is more distant and it's more disconnected because I can't even get into a conversation with her. </br></br>

UCI: Right. </br></br>

Caller: You know?</br></br>

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: And it's not like a messenger where I can message her and then she'll message me right back, like it takes a while. You know?</br></br>

UCI: Absolutely. And what has your mom's experience been like with their version of quarantining? Did she explain that a little bit in the process?</br></br>

Caller: It's basically like just solitary confinement but like, you know, but you're alone. Like, like you're really - I don't know she didn't really go into too much detail. She did say though that they, they’re doing things that are kind of like messed up. Like, there's no place for them to be doing like, they, like basically, they turned out they wouldn't let them, they say it’s water conservation. So, they're not letting them shower.</br></br>

She hasn't been able to shower for two days. And that's the last time I talked to her, which was yesterday. And I don't know if she showered today. I don't know if they allowed her to, but she said she used a sink in her cell. And that's what she's been using to shower.</br></br>

UCI: Hmm. So -</br></br>

Caller: Yeah. </br></br>

UCI: As family then, when you hear these things that your mom does tell you, have you heard anything from the facility she's in? Have they given you kind of any you know kind of any indication, you know, when your mom does go into quarantine? Is there any communication in that regard to you guys?</br></br>

Caller: No. They don't tell us at all that all. They don't, they don’t let me know and that's the part that upsets me because I don't know if something happened because there was like kind of an issue going on where she was like, you know, being harassed by a CO. And I had like, I don't know if they use quarantine to just take her like and put her in solitary confinement, or if they really wanted to quarantine her as well but they did that, as well, during this time.</br></br>

And it's like, you know, they kind of abused their power. And it just really sucks because they didn't even tell me, and I didn't hear from her for like a whole week. And I was wondering, "What happened? Why is my mom not calling? Why wasn't she emailing me? Like what's going on?"</br></br>

You know? And so, I called them and they're like, "We'll look into it." I was like, "But that's my mom. Like, I need to know she's okay."</br></br> 

UCI: Yeah. Absolutely.</br></br>

Caller: And then yeah, and it's just hard. And it's like if I get upset and I like argue with them, or I try to speak up, they go and they take it out on her. And it's not fair.</br></br>

UCI: That's so interesting to hear this side of it. So, the only communication then, your family receives is what your mom tells you or you know, doesn't tell you essentially with the water conservation?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah.</br></br>

UCI: Was your mom working at the facility prior to COVID? Was she taking any classes? And has that all stopped?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah. They all have stopped. She was, actually, she's been enrolled in college classes. And I believe she might be still like doing one of her classes, which is, I think. Hold on. Let me see. She sent me an email with the, I think it was like contemporary or something. Yeah, I'm not sure what class it was. But she's taking one class and she's able to like do writing and sending it, like in a letter, I guess.</br></br>

UCI: Oh okay.</br></br>

Caller: But the other classes that she has to like, I guess go in person, like go to her groups and all that, that stopped. And they're like - it's just not really letting them, it doesn't make sense. Because it's like if you don't want them to be sick, you're doing things, you know like, not letting them shower, keeping them confined and not letting them shower.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah. Is she in her cell pretty much 24/7? Does she not have the ability to -

Caller: Yeah. Sometimes.

UCI:  - go to recreational stuff anymore?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah. Yeah. So, a lot of the times now they're like closing down the yard constantly. You know? So, she'll tell me like, ‘cause I'll ask her cause sometimes, like she'll call me, and she'll sound very antsy, or kind of irritated, or irritable.</br></br>

And I'm like, "Why are you feeling that way?" And she's just like, "I don't know. I just, I kind of just want to go outside, I need like, I guess I just need fresh air." And I asked her, "Why don't you go outside?" And she was, "Because they closed the yard down. I can't go out whenever I want."</br></br>

UCI: Do you guys feel, do you, your family, and your mother feel as if these water conservation and closing of the yard are really sporadic or do you see it when there's spikes in cases?</br></br>

Caller: Honestly, I feel it may be, because there was a spike [unintelligible] recently, and we have a curfew now here in California. </br></br>

UCI: Mmhmm. </br></br>
 
Caller: So, because of that they told them that they were going to quarantine them. But then they didn't. So it’s also like, it’s -</br></br>

UCI: A little bit of both.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah. So, it's also like, they're not really communicating well at all with anybody about anything.</br></br>

UCI: So how, as a family, did you find out that they were no longer allowed to receive visitations, or programs are being shut down, were there letters sent home, or is it just via your mom?</br></br>

Caller: It was, I have signed up for like the v-pass online and they sent me an email.</br></br>

UCI: Oh, they did. Okay. Did they give any indication of what would be available to talk to your mother? Just the emails?</br></br>

Caller: No, they honestly, for visitation I don't know when we're going to be able to visit her. And when it first happened I was not able to talk to her. So, no, they didn't. It was just, you’re not, it was the whole flu, the whole like family visit was canceled and all that.</br></br>

UCI: And that was it?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah.</br></br>

UCI: Well, how have you been coping with it all? Do you find different ways?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, just honestly, I just have to just go about everything. I just have to deal with it. It's hard. But I mean, she's been in there like my whole life. So, it's happened like once before where I wasn't able to see her for like, it was pretty much, yeah this long, more, or less. But it wasn't like as dramatic as this has been, you know, where I don't even know if she's okay.</br></br>

UCI: Right. Wow. Well, I really appreciate you sharing your experience. I can't imagine how hard it must be to have no communication, pretty much right, you talk to her. </br></br>

Caller: Yeah.</br></br>

UCI: But do you feel as if when you do talk to your mom on the phone, she doesn't want to tell you everything? Do you think that, they, she's kind of holding back?</br></br>

Caller: Well, yeah. Definitely. Yeah. All the time. We can't really, it's not like in person, you know? She can’t, I haven't hugged her. I can't like, you know, like look at her when she talks. Like, we can't laugh. We can't take pictures. We can't do any of that.</br></br>

UCI: I'm so sorry. Yeah, I can't imagine what you're going through. But I really appreciate you sharing your experience because you know better than me that there's a lot more people out there who are going through similar things.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah.</br></br>

All the unknowns and not being able to communicate, right, with their family members or, you know, the things that prisons are doing. And before we sign off, is there any last kind of thing you want people to know about what it's like to be a family member with someone incarcerated during the pandemic?</br></br>

Caller: It's just very uncertain, all the time, every day. That's it.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, I bet. I mean just kind of hoping you hear from your mom. Right. The next day, hoping you get an email or a phone call. Just the ups and downs. Well, thank you so much for sharing your story. I really appreciate it.

Caller: No problem.
