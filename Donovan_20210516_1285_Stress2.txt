Now that is something I am scared about. I’m getting released right after a pandemic, the state will give me $300.00 to parole with and hopefully some kind of re-entry housing? I also spent the time working on my book of poems. It’s about the perspective of life through a prisoner’s eyes. Life, love, death, addiction, insanity, family, incarceration, hope……</br></br>

I’ve been through all of it and I lost a lot of myself along the way in order to come into being I am now. I’ve enclosed one of the poems that’s in my book. I hope you guys enjoy it and feel free to give me some feedback. The county is struggling right now but I see hope where some only see broken. Even in here racism is almost nonexistent.</br></br>

For a long time I never fit in because I’m not and it could have cost me my life years ago at places like Pelican Bay and I’ve been there. I’ve been lucky I suppose at times I feel I have a guardian angel because I’ve had some close calls in here like COVID-19. It was death for some and a minor irritant for others.</br></br>

So I’ve enclosed a picture of me with my long hair which I just cut and donated. Give you guys a face with my words. You can use my name with my words. I don’t mind. Heck I might get some fan mail to warm this ole lonely heart of mine! Be nice to have a friend.</br></br> 

Well take care. I do hope I did you all justice. I want to thank you from the deepest depth of my heart! It gives me hope, and loses my fear that people care out there, really care. Thanks.</br></br>

Respectfully</br></br>
