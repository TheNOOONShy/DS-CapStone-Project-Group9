Hello PrisonPandemic members,</br></br>I am writing to express my strong support to PrisonPandemic and the team at UCI. First I want to start off by thanking all of you and everyone associated. I really appreciate the fact that you felt it was important to reach out to show that we (inmates) are thought about and not out of sight out of mind.</br></br>I am a college student at community college. IÕm majoring in business. I will graduate hopefully next semester. COVID-19 has affected me in that way by putting my education on hold for a few months.</br></br> 

When we first went on lockdown it was really chaotic and unorganized. School, vocational training, self-help groups, visiting all came to a sudden stop.</br></br>I formally attended college in another location which I was housed then I got transferred and decided to continue to further my education. IÕve been waiting close to a year persistently trying to reenroll and transfer my units over. Hard work and dedication paid off finally they received my transcript.</br></br>So now IÕm waiting for my education plan and summer to begin so I can finish strong. This semester was a bit stressful that we are really isolated because COVID and I took four classes. I am a father of three children so this is my motivation to keep striving.</br></br>I caught COVID-19 and was sent to ASU until I came back negative. To be honest there is no safety in here when it comes to COVID-19 so I feel really vulnerable. Thank God for my youth (29 years old) and strong immune system. I was able to make a full recovery.</br></br>Just recently in March we started receiving visits again if you and family members both pass test. Social distancing is enforced but it is still wonderful to share time with loved ones. For the most part everyone I know have been receiving vaccinations. I am fully vaccinated! I got my second shot on March 20th 2021.</br></br> 

I was very skeptical at first but if I can play part of saving someone by not passing it on then it is a good selfless deed to me.</br></br>COVID-19 was a very surprising unfortunate event in history but if we all work together to keep each other safe then we will overcome it. I am 29 years old, I should be released in early 2023. I have been saving up and fixing up my credit so I can become a business owner/farmer upon my release. I plan on moving to Missouri to start a family.</br></br>I came into prison a lost boy now IÕm leaving a changed man. I will gladly help out with any insight, assistance on researches just contact me to some address or can contact me on my tablet via message/email through JPay app. I can respond instantly.</br></br>I wish the best of luck to you and your project have a blessed day.
