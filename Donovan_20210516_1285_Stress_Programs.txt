Unfortunately people use the funds on negative aspects also. We all have our demons. I am so glad I’ve spent the last 10 years to conquer mine.</br></br>

I’m in the new drug treatment program here called the Matt program. It consists of treating opiate addictions with counseling and suboxone, and believe me it works. I had been abstinent from heroin for 10 years but still had cravings.</br></br>

The suboxone blocks the receptors to stop the cravings completely. The recovery part of the treatment is through the Phoenix House and it is good. I’ll be paroling in March of 2022 and it is a relief to not have a monkey on my back after 26 years of incarceration.</br></br>

So finally the system is not punishing us for addiction and treating us instead. So I spent my stimulus money on a pen pal ad on writeaprisoner.com. That ad will be up and running in a month or so if anyone be interested in helping me get used to interacting with the free world again.</br></br>
