This letter was written by a person incarcerated at San Quentin.</br></br>

I guess the only thing that's important is the money they receive for my stay here. Now, I have to worry about the flu season, and we don't know how the virus or flu will react together. Well, I think I'm worrying too much, but do you blame me in my situation? Let's look at it this way.</br></br> 

I am hanging in there, and I'm not giving up. So, with that, I would like to thank you for your writing to me and letting me vent.</br></br> 

Sincerely,</br></br> 

Your friend.
