This story was told by a person incarcerated at Twin Towers Correctional Facility.</br></br>

Caller: Well, I had a very tough time. I had to go into surgery and God willing I made it through. And my family was also sick, and they also need surgery but they pulled through and they didn't need surgery.</br></br>

But I ended up being up here and it was very harsh conditions for me to try to pull through with a reversal colostomy and pull - you know, make it. Even though I went to several places, like - by - how do they say, like I traveled to different jails and different hospitals. And it was - it was pretty harsh for me to kind of pull through because by court order I was having to take medication that I wasn't used to and then I would have allergic reactions to it.</br></br> 

So, I'm still undergoing that right now. So, it's very kind of hard to explain but it's pretty - I'm just glad that I - that I made it through. And I'm still gonna, I hope to get out before anything gets worse with the pandemic, to see my family.
