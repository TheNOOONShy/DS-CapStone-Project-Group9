This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Chino.</br></br>
Hi,</br></br>I was given one of the letters that you sent a friend of mine, and so he shared the letter with me, and in the letter you had mentioned to write about our experiences here in (CIM) so I would like to share my ups and downs during the COVID-19 which I have gotten.</br></br> 

Well when it started there was a lot of change in our programs, like AA groups, veteran groups, mental health groups, school academics, our church services, Catholic and protestant, Jewish, Muslim, and our music programs, which we haven't had any of these programs.</br></br> 

Most of our self-help programs we had to do in our buildings, so it's been on our own to really continue in the studies. We also had to continue our schoolwork assignments in our buildings, and then hand them in after a week, so that's how we accommodated to all these changes.</br></br>

But I know there is a light at the end of the tunnel, I'm not giving up. I will continue to be positive in this crisis with God's help. Thank you for your time.
