This story was told by a person incarcerated at John Latorraca Correctional Center.</br></br>

Caller: Hello?</br></br>

UCI: Hi.</br></br>

Caller: Okay. Yeah. So I just spoke with you already.</br></br>

UCI: Yes.</br></br>

Caller: Okay. So where - where do you want me to start?</br></br>

UCI: If you want to restart at the beginning or if you want to start at where you kind of left off, about that – where right before we did the consent process.</br></br>

Caller: Okay. Well, they - it - for the past two years, right – because I've been here - I've been here, in this jail, for five. And, for the past two years, we've had - we've had no visits during the COVID. They cut our visits. Right?</br></br>

They even - they stopped allowing attorney visits. Like people got to have – the attorney's got to have their COVID shot even to see their attorney. And so, if your attorney doesn't have a COVID shot, they've been denying our lawyers to come see us, too.</br></br>

And a lot of these lawyers – you know what I'm saying – are hard to get ahold of on the phone and everything else. So it's - it's been really hectic with our legal representation because of the COVID. And this - this facility, too, has been having a lot of other problems. Like I said before, the plumbing went out for four days.</br></br>

And so they had to bring Porta Potties on the yard. And there was only four Porta Potties for 300 inmates to share. And you only got to go out once a day and use them.</br></br>

And there was no showers, no clean drinking water. And this is in the midst, when everybody's getting COVID. And they're not doing that good of a job, either, of quarantine inmates. You know what I'm saying?</br></br> 

Like that's - that's - that's like real hit and miss. People are coming through to - to population that still have COVID. And they're - they're infecting us. And a lot of that, too, is coming from the guards.</br></br>

Because I personally ask multiple guards, and they're anti-vaccine. So they don't got the vaccine. And most of them don't wear their masks when they come in here, either. And my - my fiancée's in Chowchilla Prison. Right?</br></br>

And she told me – she wrote me, in a letter, said the same thing that's going there – that like a lot of females in her building got infected because the - the officers brought it in. Because they're not wearing masks. They're not getting shots. And so the officers are bringing it in a lot of times.</br></br>

UCI: I understand. And have you witnessed any vaccination processes going on at your facility?</br></br>

Caller: Yes. I got the - I got the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. It - it made me sick, sick, sick. Like you know what I'm saying? For 24 hours, it felt like the worst opiate withdrawal imaginable. But I'm - I'm glad I got the vaccine.</br></br>

You know what I'm saying? I try to push all the other inmates that are in here to get it. You know what I'm saying? But they're real hit and miss. They're spotty with that.</br></br>

Because the County Health Department doesn't always have the vaccines on staff here. So - so like I was putting in medical requests for like six months before I finally got the vaccine. And then, they finally gave it to me. And then, they're just sporadically.</br></br>

Like they'll come by like once every month or two now and do it. But and they're behind on their booster shots, too. So there's a lot of inmates that got the first shot but haven't got their second shot. So, yeah, it's - it's not going too - too great on that.</br></br>

UCI: And you said that they're getting their first shot but they're not getting their second shot. Do you know what kind of, I guess, timeline we're looking at, as far as the distance between the first one and the second one?</br></br>

Caller: No, I don't. I've just talked to inmates on the yard and stuff and different places, said they've got the first one but not the second one. I got the Johnson & Johnson. So I only had to get one. But there's - there's no set shot on what they - what they give here.</br></br>

It's just whatever the Health Department has, I guess, a surplus of at the time, they - they send down to our jail. So, sometimes, they'll have Moderna. Right? Sometimes, it's the Johnson & Johnson. Right?</br></br>

Sometimes, it's a - it's a different shot. So I got Johnson & Johnson. So I only had to do it once. But even that was pretty - pretty hectic trying to get it.</br></br>

You know what I'm saying? Just because there was - there was a vaccine shortage, I guess. But I don't know.</br></br>

UCI: Okay. And you said you had to wait about six months to get your shot?</br></br>

Caller: Yes.</br></br>

UCI: And how many times did you have to file a report to, I guess, get the shot?</br></br>

Caller: Aw, dude, I was turning in medical slips every week.</br></br>

UCI: Okay. So it seems like it's - it's like a challenge to even get the vaccine, even if you want it.</br></br>

Caller: Yes, it is. Because I don't know how it is at CDC prison right now. But, it at least, on the county level, they don't - they don't keep shots here. You know what I'm saying?</br></br>

The Health Department will send some over at various different times. And so it's real hit and miss. So, when - when you come in, you got to put a medical request slip in for the shot.</br></br>

And then, you got to wait until some vaccines show up. And then, once they do show up – you know what I'm saying – you got to hope that you're high enough on the list to get one before it runs out, or you get put over until the next shipment.</br></br>

UCI: Okay.</br></br>

Caller: And I know this because I asked medical. The nurse told me. That's why it took me so long to - to get my shot. Because I turned in a lot of request slips to get - to get the - the COVID shot.</br></br>

UCI: I see. And when did you get vaccinated?</br></br>

Caller: Oh, it's probably been like – I don't know – probably - probably, a month ago.</br></br>

UCI: Okay. That's good.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah. Probably, a month ago now, I think. Yeah.</br></br>

UCI: And did you ever get COVID or know of anyone like in your facility that had COVID?</br></br>

Caller: Oh, yeah. Yeah. There's - there's - there's a lot of – when – right now, I'm in - right now, I'm in a dorm. Okay? But, six months ago, I was in the SHU. And I was in lockdown where it's individual cells. And people with COVID were – they would put in there.</br></br>

You know what I'm saying? And they would just put them in a single cell, by themselves. And they would put a red - a red sticker by their door. And you know that that's the people that had COVID. So like you had to keep your distance like if you went by there or something.</br></br>

But they still had their tray slots open. They still had to get - get food and everything like that. But they would - tehy would put them in their own cell. So I was – I had a lot of neighbors and stuff in - in administrative segregation that had - that had COVID.</br></br>

But I never got it in there. But here, here on the yard – right – where the dorms are at, they have a couple dorms that are set aside for quarantine. Right?</br></br>

And people do come in there, off the streets, with it. Yeah. And they get it. And then they have to start the quarantine process again.</br></br>

UCI: Okay. I see. And how has COVID affected your programming and visitations?</br></br>

Caller: Oh, it tremendously. Like I said, I haven't had a visit in two years. And I can't even get - I can't even my attorney to come in and see me. Because, now - now - now, they even turn away our attorney, saying that the attorney's need COVID shots. And, if an attorney doesn't have it, then they - they can't come in to see us.</br></br>

UCI: Right. And so what - are they offering any other solutions to getting in contact with your attorneys and having visitation, besides getting the vaccine?</br></br>

Caller: No. No. And I mean you can call - you can call our attorneys on a phone, I guess. You know what I'm saying? Just like a paid phone call.</br></br>

But, as far as a attorney visit – and, see, what makes it really hectic about that, you understand, these - these lines that we talk on are recorded. So we can't have a confidential attorney-client conversation on these pay phones about our court cases. Because – you know what I'm saying – you - you can't - you can't talk about things over these phone. There's no privacy.</br></br>

So - so that's like, it puts us in a tough situation. Because we're supposed to be able to meet with our attorneys and - and talk with them. But, anytime we talk with our attorney, now, the COs are recording it. And they listen to our phone calls, which is illegal.</br></br>

UCI: Right. And you mentioned that the prison staff does not need to be vaccinated to go into the building?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah. No. No. The - the jail staff. This is County now.</br></br>

UCI: Oh.</br></br>

Caller: Prison, now – yeah – this is - this is County officers. They - they don't have to be - they don't have to be vaccinated. No.</br></br>

UCI: I see. So they're not allowing lawyers in that are not vaccinated, but the staff can be unvaccinated.</br></br>

Caller: Yes. Because, I guess - I guess what – I asked one of the officers about that. And I guess they said that they have to pass a COVID test every - every three days or something if they choose not to get the shot.</br></br>

UCI: Okay.</br></br>

Caller: There's - there's something - there's something like that. They opt out. So a lot - a lot of these officers aren't getting the COVID shot. They're just, I guess, taking a test every three days.</br></br>

But they're - they're supposed to be wearing masks, I heard. I don't know. I heard - I heard administrative rumors – that administration said they're supposed to wear masks. But they don't.</br></br>

UCI: I see. So they don't offer any like negative test option for your lawyers or any people that want to visit – I mean visitation is cut off, as of right now – but for your lawyers?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah. I mean, if a lawyer - if a lawyer has a – is vaccinated – then, yeah. You know what I'm saying? They can come in. But, if - if they're not vaccinated, then - then, no.</br></br>

UCI: I see. Okay. Well, is there - is there anything else you want anyone to know about your experience inside at this time?</br></br>

Caller: Well, I mean just that I don't - I don't want to – things, really, in - in CDC and - and in the County jails right now are not getting handled the way they should be – you know what I'm saying? As far as like keeping COVID patients segregated from the rest of the population, keeping – you know what I'm saying – guards – you know what I'm saying – that - that don't have vaccines, that don't have the masks. You know what I'm saying?</br></br>

Like it's just – I don't know. The - the way things are getting - getting handled, it's like that's why so many inmates are getting sick right now. And, especially, in CDC, so many are dying.</br></br>

UCI: Right. And you said your fiancée is at Chowchilla. Correct?</br></br>

Caller: Yes. My fiancée is at Chowchilla. And - and she writes me about that. Now, she - she caught COVID-19 herself. And she - she was really sick.</br></br>

UCI: And was she vaccinated?</br></br>

Caller: I don't believe so. But she's vaccinated now. She wrote me and said she got vaccinated now.</br></br>

UCI: Okay. That's good for her.</br></br>

Caller: But they gave, again they gave - they gave her the Moderna, she said. And so they gave her the first dose. I don't know if she got a booster shot. But I know - I know, after she got COVID, they gave her a shot – the first shot.</br></br>

But I don't know if she got the second one. But she said that a lot of girls in her - in her building and in her cell – they're in six-woman cells over there, she said – they all caught it. And - and she told me it was from the guards. Because there was no new arrivals.</br></br>

There was no new inmates coming in. Because, for a long time, CDC stopped receiving new inmates because of COVID. Okay? So inmates were getting infected by the guards. But, now, CDC opened up the reception centers again – Chowchilla, for the women's.</br></br>

Delano is a men's reception center. Tri City is a men's reception center. San Quentin is a men's reception center. Since they opened these reception centers again, people from County with COVID are going back in the prison system.</br></br>

So, now, a lot more prison inmates are getting infected again. Because it's not just the guards bringing it in but it's other inmates.</br></br>

UCI: Do you know at what point of time they stopped letting, I guess, transfers occur?</br></br>

Caller: You know, I know that they just started doing transfers again. They started allowing it about two months ago. But, for – I know, for the women's facility, they stopped - they stopped taking in - in new inmates for over a year. And they just stopped - they just picked it up again like two months ago.</br></br>

UCI: Oh. So inmates-</br></br>

Caller: But, the - the men's - the men's CDC – Delano – because Delano's our reception center, right here. Delano - Delano's been receiving inmates for a couple months right now. But they - they - they stopped, too, for about a year, I would say.</br></br>

UCI: Okay. So, according to your fiancée and her cellmates, it seems that all the cases are coming from guards. Because there weren't any transfers up until two months ago.</br></br>

Caller: Yes. Yeah. That's what she - that's what she told me in a letter she wrote me. So she said - she said the guards were bringing it into the women's facility.</br></br>

UCI: Okay. Well, I - thank you so much for your information that you shared. And we appreciate you calling. And, if you have any friends or anyone that has a story to share, we'd love to hear from them.</br></br>

Caller: Thank you. And, hey, I'm gonna - I'm gonna slide that letter that you sent – I'm going to forward that to my fiancée. And I'll - I'll let her know about it, too, in case any of the women want to do that.</br></br>

UCI: That would be amazing. Thank you so much.</br></br>

Caller: You're welcome. God bless.</br></br>

UCI: Have a good night.</br></br>

Caller: Bye-bye.</br></br>

UCI: Bye-bye.
