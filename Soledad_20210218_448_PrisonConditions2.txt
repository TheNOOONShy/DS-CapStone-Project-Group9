This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Soledad.</br></br>

Next, at first when the cases started exploding in here, it was in a different facility. CTF North is comprised of North, South, and Central facilities. The virus was spreading through Central facility. Not attached to us.</br></br> 

No problem. Wrong! Staff from over there would and currently still are working overtime between yards. Yes, that's right.</br></br>

Before there was a single inmate case in North facility, staff working over at the known to be infected Central facility, would work their shift over there in the hot zone, and then come pull a shift over here on North facility. That was still infection free!</br></br> 

This policy was questioned by me personally and by some staff. Answer: the guards union says you cannot deny an officer the right to get some overtime pay. Gotta make that money, right?!</br></br>

As inmates, to date, we have no access to any meaningful cleaning supplies to maintain common sense sanitary measures. We are provided a highly watered-down issue of prison made disinfectant called "Cellblock 64". No that's not a joke.</br></br>

Purportedly, at a one to one ratio, nine-one ounce to one gallon, this stuff kills everything. The problem is that it is never applied as the instructions indicate. Which say it must be sprayed or applied to hard surfaces and left wet for 10 to 15 minutes for it to be effective.</br></br>

Never happens. No bleach!</br></br>

Moving on to other safety issues. Currently in a (put a bullet proof vest on after you've been shot) move, we are on lockdown. We are locked in our cells 24/7. We are not getting yard. We are not even getting our shower, at least every 72 hours as mandated.</br></br>

Contrary to the standardized menus that are published, for public consumption, pun intended, when they put on the menu that we are being served baked ham, rice pilaf, stir fry, creamed beef, calico scrambled eggs, broccoli alfredo, chicken tetrazzini, chicken cobb salad, etc. etc.</br></br> 

I assure you, we see no such food as this. The food that we get would make hospital food seem like gourmet food. And I received bigger portions on my tray in second grade than we get here. I've measured it, one ounce of macaroni.</br></br>

And for those who say, â€œOh poor wittle inmate in his cell hungwee" that's a good one, catchy. But I say on a more mature note, since the nature of this post was to expose prison conditions during this pandemic. I say consider your dead mother, father, grandma, grandpa, kids, friends, family members, etc., that may be dead because careless prison staff created a human petri dish in which this virus has spread.</br></br>

They injected it into our sterile environment, allowed it flourish, worked in and amongst it. And then come out there to the Safeway where your mother is shopping and sneeze COVID-I9 infected droplets in here vicinity and then days later you have her cremated. Now who's the criminal? Merry Christmas!</br></br> 

But I digress.</br></br>

Does this make sense? Currently, two inmates are housed in every cell designed for one. My cell mate coughs are posterior. Could never be more than three feet way a from my face. Right now, the prison, in it wisdom is doing this: if one inmate in the cell or two test positive, they move the one off to quarantine.</br></br> 

The other stays behind. Then they move some other inmate in with the inmate that did not immediately test positive, that time.</br></br>

Next thing you know the original negative inmate does test positive on a subsequent test. They move him out to quarantine and leave the other guy behind, repeat, repeat, repeat.</br></br>

The prison was unwilling and unprepared to manage this contagion. Even though proponents of prison reform always cite the overcrowding and "That if a contagion ever got loose in one of those prisons?" well, now you don't have to wonder.</br></br> 

This is as they announce a mutant variant seventy percent more contagious. Better get some body bags!
