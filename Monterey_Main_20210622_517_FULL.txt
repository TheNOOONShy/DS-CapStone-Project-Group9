This story was told by a person incarcerated at Monterey County Correctional Facility.</br></br>

UCI: What facility are you currently housed at?</br></br>

Caller: Monterey County in Salinas, California.</br></br>

UCI: And what has the COVID situation been like at your facility?</br></br>

Caller: Well, I came in kind of in the middle of all of it. And I got put in quarantine for like -- I think you're only supposed to be in there 14 days, but I was in there for 24. Quarantine is like they keep you away from everybody and everything. And I only got a shower like three times the whole time I was in there.</br></br>

UCI: Mhm.</br></br>

Caller: So, this facility's kind of crazy as it is. It's not like any prisons or jail I've ever been in before. But I haven't seen a single case of COVID-19 at all, like since I've been here. And I've been here since April.</br></br>

UCI: You said you haven't seen a COVID case since you've been there?</br></br>

Caller: No.</br></br>

UCI: Okay. Have you -- has your facility started doing vaccinations?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, I got vaccinated.</br></br>

UCI: Are there like a lot of people that are able to get it? Or is it do they choose who can get vaccinated? What's the vaccination situation like?</br></br>

Caller: It's the choice of the person whether or not they want to get vaccinated. But they offer it to all inmates.</br></br>

UCI: Oh, okay. And so how have you been coping with the crisis?</br></br>

Caller: Well, I could say that the whole COVID-19 thing kind of displaced me from my home. And I ended up - I'm from Oregon. And I walked -- I walked from Oregon to California, trying to get to the man that I'm with.</br></br> 

But he -- he was in federal prison. He just got out recently. But I haven't seen a single person with it. Like I've been in the ER a couple times, and I've been in homeless camps.</br></br>

I've been all over the place. Literally all over the place. Idaho, California, Washington, Oregon. And I haven't seen a single person with it.</br></br>

UCI: Mhm. So, have you -- sorry?</br></br>

Caller:	Yeah, go ahead.</br></br>

UCI: So, what's it been like to have reduced visitation or programming? Have you -- are they starting to allow you to have programs in your jail again? Or are you still just having to stay in your cells?</br></br>

Caller: Remaining for my call. Do I call you back?</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, of course. Yeah, feel free to call us back.</br></br>

Caller: Okay, yeah it'll hang up here in a minute. So -- but no, there's no programs going on.</br></br>

UCI: Sorry?</br></br>

Caller: There's no programs going on.</br></br>

UCI: Oh, okay. Well, since it's going to hang up, I'll just answer your call the next time you call. We look forward to it.</br></br>

Caller: Okay, sounds good. Thank you.</br></br>

UCI: Thank you, bye-bye.</br></br>

Caller: Bye-bye.
