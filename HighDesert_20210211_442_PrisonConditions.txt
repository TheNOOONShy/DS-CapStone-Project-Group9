We have to create a disturbance to get what we are required to have. I really don’t know where to begin but I’ll give you a couple situations I’ve been in.</br></br>


Before the corona, the attitude with C.O.s is they give us as less as possible, especially this yard. The C.O.s call this the piece of shit yard. So imagine if we were getting next to nothing before the virus, imagine now. Before they would find ways not to run program, program meaning open up yard, dayroom, phones, showers, time out the cell.</br></br>


Now they don’t have to find ways. They blame everything on testing or COVID related, short of staff. I went from talking to my family once or twice a day to once a week if I’m lucky.</br></br> 


I haven’t been to store in a month. We had to create a protest to get to store. We had to protest to get phones and when we do that they don’t like it so then they find legal ways to fuck us. Or they’ll run phones for a small group for 30 minutes and shut ‘em off for the rest of the day. And in the books it will say they ran the phones.
