This story was told by a person incarcerated at Fresno County Jail.</br></br>

UCI: Okay, so go ahead and just tell me what it's been like.</br></br>

Caller: Well, I've already presented this to another student, so I mean, I can do it again, but I mean it might be unnecessary. I just wanted to reassure that the address that she gave me - well I was, it was - I had - okay, well let me just - we're on quarantine. We haven't had court.</br></br>

We've been here for three and a half weeks. No movement. This - it's very overwhelming at times.</br></br>

We're dealing with different minds, different levels of consciousness. So, it's - it's always something going on that is, you know, not necessarily negative but concerning.</br></br>

We're in a tank the size of a Starbucks, a walk-in. And there's 45 of us in here - 44, 45. There's no movement. No court.</br></br>

No one's stepped out of this tank within three weeks, so we're overwhelmed. We're concerned. We're afraid.</br></br>

And a lot of us, like I said, we show our concerns and our fear in different ways. So, sometimes some act out.</br></br>

And it's a psych tank. A tank that holds people with severe mental illnesses. Not necessarily severe, but people that take medication.</br></br>

There's a number of patients in here, inmate patients, that talk to themselves, walk around, you know, do random things that are unnecessary and you know, causes conflict, you know, like just walking and just turning the TV off for no reason.</br></br>

You know, just silly things like that and talking to themselves, yelling and screaming at themselves. We had a self-mutilation just a couple weeks ago, attempted suicide.</br></br>

And what was interesting was they had no procedure or policy to - to take the person out of here on quarantine. So, they couldn't put the person who committed these acts into isolation or -</br></br>

What they do is primitive here. They handcuff you, and they put you in a little tank, a little cage that you can barely move around in. Okay, a phone booth. Imagine a phone booth.</br></br>

You're probably too young to even know what a phone booth is. I'm kidding. Do you know what a phone booth is?</br></br>

UCI: I - I do, yes. I can picture it perfectly.</br></br>

Caller: Okay, well, imagine us in a cage with a - with like a lock on it. Okay, and that's what they put inmates who commit self-mutilation or who are suicidal.</br></br>

And people who are suicidal, which I've been before, I attempted suicide by cop, that's why I'm here, evading and - felony evading and auto theft.</br></br>

And my plan was to commit suicide by cop. It didn't happen. The cops were too - too kindhearted to kill me.</br></br>

You know, so it was very interesting. I - I really wanted to die. Anyway, it's just because I'm lonely and confused sometimes.</br></br>

The COVID you know it - it killed, you know, a couple friends of mine. And it - you know, friends that - they were the only friends that I had, you know. Even I, but you know - and - and - it was just overwhelming. So, I went off of the deep end. And it causes - it causes a lot of suffering.</br></br>

But like I told the last student that, you know, in one sense, it does devastate families, but in a different sense, it causes a lot of us to come together as humans to overcome, you know, the obstacles that we're faced with each day, you know? And you're - are you majoring in sociology?</br></br>

UCI: No, I am psychology.</br></br>

Caller: Oh, psychology. What kind - child development or?</br></br>

UCI: No, more on the behavioral side.</br></br>

Caller: Behavioral. Okay, well, I can give you some - I have 26 years incarceration. I'm 46 years old. And you know what, I don't mind giving my name because I want people to know - if I die, if I have COVID because we're in quarantine, so it's rough.</br></br>

Okay, and we're going to find out, you know?. If somebody does have it, then we have to stay in here together. With - this is what's horrible, you know?. We have to stay in here with the person, you know?.</br></br>

You know what I'm saying? There's no - There's no - we have no due process. Like how do we protect ourselves from this, you know?</br></br>

It's like - it's - everything's played by ear, even with the policy and procedure. Because there's no policy and procedure for COVID. This is all brand-new.</br></br>

So, when things happen like somebody contracts COVID, they don't - the facility isn't clear on what to do, how to protect the environment, how to protect the, you know, community, how to protect the other inmates. So, I guess they're - they're like playing it by ear, so it's - it's a hardship for all of us because.</br></br>

And I want to say something about these guards. They're purple hearts. I call 'em purple hearts. They come in here and do their duty, knowing that they can die. They can contract this.</br></br>

They are very, very beautiful people. This is what's bringing us together as inmates, okay? The psychology behind it is that they're kind hearted. They care.</br></br>

So we - we're forced to evaluate that. We're forced to deal with that as humans and say, "These guards aren't like, 'Fuck the police' kind of thing," you know the attitude that us bad boys have, you know? It's not like that no more.</br></br>

We don't see that. We see people. We see humans. We're humans first, and we're inmates second, you know?</br></br>

That's what the guards are like introducing to us now. That's the - the persona that they're carrying, you know? They're very kind now, you know?</br></br>

And their kindness doesn't - doesn't corrupt or pollute the spirit of their law, of their duties. They're kindhearted in a way that is respectful and not weak.</br></br>

And that's - that's one of the main - you're dealing in psychology, so, you know, that's one of the things that I think, you know? I've read Sigmund Freud. I've read all his books when I was 15. I mean, I've read Carl Gustav Jung. They used to call Sigmund Freud "Siggy" when he was in college, you know?</br></br>

I'm familiar with that psychoanalysis and - and collective unconscious, and all that. And it's very interesting, but I wouldn't bet too hard on Sigmund Freud because he was kind of a drug addict, I think. And he corrupted his mind with cocaine, you know, kinda other stuff so.</br></br>

Anyway, just keep that in mind when you're reading his - his work.</br></br>

And - so, okay, anyways, there's - there's UCLA School of Law, right? That's - they have a pen-pal service. I got the address down from somebody, one of the students prior, about three weeks ago. You know, the first one I talked to.</br></br>

And I don't know if the - I wrote it wrong or she gave it to me wrong. Can I get that again?</br></br>

UCI: So that - that pen-pal program that we're directly - we're connected with; you're at Fresno County Jail, am I right?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, awaiting prison.</br></br>

UCI: Okay, so they only - they only reach out to prisons. So, if you get transferred to a prison, then they can set you up, but they don't work with the jails so much.</br></br>

I can give you their information, and then if you write to them when you do get transferred, then they can set you up. But I don't know if they'll be able to do anything before you're transferred, if that makes sense.</br></br>

Caller: We - we'll see. It's good to have the address, you know what I mean?</br></br>

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: Because these are the things that we need. We need - we need community support.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, totally - totally. And, you know, they may be a little backlogged; I'm not really sure, to be honest. So, it may take time but just keep that in mind, like if you - that they just deal with the prisons directly.</br></br>

So, they're happy to have anybody write to them that's in a prison or, you know, just transferred to a prison, or you know, whatever the situation is. They just have to be from a prison and not a jail. So again, they're super happy to help but just like that one little -</br></br>

Caller: Glitch.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, but let me give it to you in case you do want to pass it out, which I think is super helpful because I know we've gotten a few calls where some people are really getting transferred now that the courts seem to be opening back up.</br></br>

So, whenever you're ready, I can give you the information.</br></br>

Caller: I'm ready now.</br></br>

UCI: Okay, cool. So, you're going to write it to Incarcerated Persons Pen-Pal Project. That's like the name you can address it to.</br></br>

Caller: Incarcerated Per - okay.</br></br>

UCI: It's kind of a lot - lot of P's. And then - and then you're gonna just - under that, you're gonna put the UCLA School of Law.</br></br>

Caller: UCLA School of Law.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah. And then this is their address. It's 385 Charles - Charles, like C as in cat, E. Young--</br></br>

Caller: Like Prince Charles?</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, Charles.</br></br>

Caller: Young like Charles Gustav Young? Like the psychologist?</br></br>

UCI: Yes, yes, yes. Took me a minute.</br></br>

Caller: They're not talking about Charles Young, are they? Oh no, that's Carl Young. Carl Young.</br></br>

UCI: Carl Young. Yeah, I was - yeah, so this is Charles E. Young, like Y-O-U-N-G.</br></br>

Caller: Y-O-U-N-G, okay, Young.</br></br>

UCI: Drive East.</br></br>

Caller: Middle name?</br></br>

UCI: Charles E, as in Elephant.</br></br>

Caller:  Oh, A, that's - oh, E. I can't spell very good. Elephant starts with an A, don't it? Alaphant, like Al? A-L?</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, it's okay. So, it's Charles - 385 Charles E. Young Drive East.</br></br>

Caller:  That sounds like you're giving me directions to go to a building. You want me to drive?--</br></br>

UCI: I know. I know it's - So, all that. I'll say it one more time, just in case. It's 385 Charles E. Young Drive East.</br></br>

Caller: Young Drive East, okay.</br></br>

UCI: Good. And then their box number is 951 -</br></br>

Caller: Is it a PO box or just box?</br></br>

UCI: They just say box. So, I'm sure you can just write box. Yeah, 95 -</br></br>

Caller:  95 -</br></br>

UCI: 1-4-7-6.</br></br>

Caller: 476, uh-huh.</br></br>

UCI: And then Los Angeles, California.</br></br>

Caller: Mhmm.</br></br>

UCI: 9-0-0-9-5.</br></br>

Caller:  9-0-0-9-5. Nine, triple zero, nine-five. Okay, and -</br></br>

UCI: Oh, it's just double zero.</br></br>

Caller: Oh, double zero. 9-0-0-9-5.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, there you go. So, you told -</br></br>

Caller: It seems like you ponder on? I'm sure, you're a student, right?</br></br>

UCI: I am. I'm sure you told your story to my other team member though, it sounds like.</br></br>

Caller:  Yeah. 

UCI: Yeah.

Caller: But I mean, there's gotta be questions. I mean, I'm sure there's questions if you've seen, you know?</br></br>

UCI: No, we - yeah, we - we generally have the same questions for everyone, and then, you know, people pick and choose kind of topics they really want to talk about, so if there's anything that comes up that changes, like if you do end up getting transferred or something happens with, you know - you know, an incident, a quarantine, like, you know, please call us back.</br></br>

We like and appreciate updates and just, you know, different things of what everybody's experiencing. I think that's really important. So, if anything changes, always call us back. You can write us. We're, you know - anything of that nature is really awesome.</br></br>

Caller: Really, okay? That's - I appreciate it. You know, and I really appreciate you, and you taking the time. That's - it's a beautiful thing. I mean it's really - you really are. I mean, giving to the community like that, it's - it's - that's love, you know what I mean? And I - and I -</br></br>

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: Love is my guide, and I follow love. I try to, you know? I mean, I really want to, you know? But I have a mental illness, so I think that gets in the way in a lot, you know, of my - my, you know - I mean, like mental illness, you know?</br></br>

You're studying psychology, and - and that's a beautiful thing too, you know? And we need kindness. We need kindness. We need people to support us.</br></br>

When I - when I stopped taking my medications is when I re-offend. So, the thing is, the transition between not taking my meds and taking 'em - I mean not taking 'em, taking 'em and not taking 'em, is - is like, something I do overnight. It's like one day I -</br></br>

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller:  I try to tell myself I'm not healed, so I'm gonna stop taking my meds, you know? So, it's a fight.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, absolutely. And we understand that.</br></br>

Caller: Read a book called "Mind Games" by the pharmaceutical companies and the psychiatric community working hand in hand to convince the public that they're sick. It's called "Mind Games."</br></br>

UCI: Great, thank you. I appreciate that, and I appreciate you talking to me. And I hope you have a good night.</br></br>

Caller: You too, okay.</br></br>

UCI: Thanks, bye.
