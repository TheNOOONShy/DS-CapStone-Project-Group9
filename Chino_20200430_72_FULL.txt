This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Chino.</br></br>

Hello UCI student,</br></br>In return I hope this finds you in good health and spirits! Thank you for reaching out to us California state prisoners. Myself along with some friends and fellow convicts will be reaching out to you.</br></br>I find myself wondering where to begin...</br></br> 

Seeing just how messed up everything here has been. Chino prison and here on the A yard has been hit quite hard there with the COVID-19 pandemic. We lost at least 21 deaths. We're also experiencing a complete lack of real life saving measures here in CIW.</br></br> 

Staff here as well as the medics! Personal have been at odds right from the start. Personally - I've been tested nine times for COVID-19. I've tested negatively all nine times. 

So what does staff here decide I should do? Is to be housed over on B yard in a building, which is full of positive tested men from all four yards down here. For my health they tell me. Even though I've never tested positive for having COVID-19. 

I must be held in quarantine status, in a building full of positive men for the COVID house. Once or if I survive that ordeal. I must be then housed over on C yard within a cell and not the dorm where I've tested negative eight times.</br></br>

Go figure. So I'm forced to submit to the move or face a serious rule violation report. So I get house on B yard within a cell which positive men just left, for 20 days and 20 nights, to be resent right back to the same yard I left for. Only this time i must live in a tent out on the yard.</br></br> 
That's right back where I began only to be forced to live in a tent. There are 13 tents out here on the sports field. With portable toilets, sinks, and showers - which are mostly cold.</br></br> 

I've been housed out here since August the 26th. On September the 26th, our tents were blown down from 50 to 60 mph winds. After having about eight to nine hours in the dining hall. Staff decided that we must allow them to move us back over to B yard... without our personal property - for only one night.</br></br> 

Right. So 85 out of 86 men told staff that we would not go without one property. They did not like us standing up to them at all. So they gave us 30 minutes to pack up everything in the world that we own before they forcibly moved us over into cells with no power - electrical, or glass in the bars - so these cells are full of dirt and leaves; trash from miles away! My cell also had no working sink.</br></br> 

Our one night turned into a four day and night stay. Once we were brought back to a new "tent city," the powers decided that since we demanded not to leave without everything we own in the world, that we must search for a missing extension cord - which is 25 feet long. So the officer who's searching my property is opening every box of soap, every toothpaste box, even letters I haven't answered yet. After 44 minutes of having all my food opened, like eight-ounce boxes of mackerel - every jar of coffee and creamer, etc., etc.</br></br>
I am a 72-year-old Vietnam combat veteran who happens to be 90% disabled from notable wounds received in combat. Medically I'm listed as high-risk medical prisoner. Naturally I must be housed out here in tent city in the elements.</br></br> I have a few friends who will also be writing to you with their take on what's happening to them during the pandemic.</br></br>Last of all, I'll part with the fact that we prisoners have no visitation since early March. And there's talk we may have some sort of video visiting. CDC, California Department of Corrections has been trying to stop contact visitation for years now. They now have the perfect reason for doing that.</br></br>Hopefully this will help you out - with what it is like for us inside the prisons.
