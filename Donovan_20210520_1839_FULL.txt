This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Donovan.</br></br>

Hello; College student(s)</br></br>My name is [redacted], I have experienced civilian, military, student, and now incarcerated times. All those chapters in my life had good and difficult roads. Many barriers and challenges to overcome. Honestly, I failed many times but I keep getting up and learning from my mistakes.</br></br> I believe in a higher power which keeps me balanced spiritual, physical, and mental. Some things I would like to share. Through this COVID-19 pandemic, in prison, it was like an earthquake of emotions. Lots of confusing news reports. Lots of people getting sick, with unknown long-term effects from this disease.</br></br>  You would think inside this bubble called Donovan Prison Facility-Echo yard, the safest place to be, since we are already isolated from the public, wrong, think again. The men and women in green also known as correctional officers, are going home each day and then return to work. They are the ones who delivered, and transferred this Coronavirus inside the prison walls.</br></br>  Then the chaos begun. Wild Spread of COVID-19. Sickness and death happening, and the medical staff and officers having no compassion for us prisoners.</br></br>  Lockdown begins, 23 hours in a cell. CDCR did not have a plan, to help inmate’s survival. Out of mind, and out of sight was their agenda. Furthermore, I did not feel safe behind bars.</br></br>CDCR didn’t provide mask. Only churches and other outside volunteer groups provided mask for our protection. That shows me that administration and correctional officers had no coping skills for this pandemic or crisis of any magnitude. Yes, there was no visits for anyone in blue.</br></br>Blue means me, I am a prisoner of the state of California. I was worried, and had anxiety running wild through my thoughts. I have developed PTSD again from this pandemic behind bars. My other PTSD symptoms come from my time in service, in the military (Army).</br></br>Anyways, my mental phase has crashed hard. Lots of depression, loneliness, and dysfunctional thinking. I may have not physically caught the virus but mentally I have caught the virus. Prison needs more funds relocated for mental health programs.</br></br>Rehabilitation is a joke for the California prison department. For so long, all it has been is the tough on crime, lock-em-up for life. I need to focus on the Coronavirus and the destruction it has caused me personally. I lost many friends, the number of death’s reported was 18 at this Donovan Correctional Facility.</br></br>One other thing, that bothers me daily is my growing racist thoughts of where this virus originated from. I believe this was no accident, the country of china has started a virus conflict! I currently struggle with the goal that we must all come together, and get vaccinations. I guess herd-immunity is the only way to get back to normal things in a positive way.</br></br>  So, I did my part, I received both vaccinations of Pfizer (no side effects). I personally have to many of the pre-conditions that coronavirus would probably put me in ICU. So, I made a decision that life is worth living longer. I didn’t want my legacy to be that COVID-19 gave me the touch of death.</br></br>  It is not my time to go see my higher power. I got lots more happiness, kindness, and love to spread in this world behind bars and one-day back in society. So, let me summarize my story with a scripture from the bible. (Proverbs 27:10) “Never abandon a friend, either yours or your father’s. when disaster strikes, you won’t have to ask your brother for assistance. It’s better to go to a neighbor than to a brother who lives far away”.</br></br>Sincerely, God bless you!
