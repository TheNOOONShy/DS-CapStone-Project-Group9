This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Pleasant Valley.</br></br>First of all I had caught COVID-19 here in PVSP. I was in building four on 11/20. I got tested for COVID-19 then instantly the next day I was red flagged with COVID-19 so they, this administration, told me to pack up my personal property cause I am being transferred to a quarantine unit. Here’s the catch you guys, there is no quarantine unit! </br></br>All this administration did was clean out a prisoner’s cell and didn’t even bother to help clean it or provide us any disinfectant soaps or cleaning detergent at all, not once. I too witnessed firsthand how the prison administration simply just shuffled us and telling us inmates, this is your makeshift quarantine hospital! get used to it. I am a big baby, but being sick and all, I was feeling sensitive.</br></br> 

One day I had respectfully asked the lovely nurses, if it's possible for me to please be treated with some medication. But she told me "no Mr., your own body your, immune system is supposed to be enough to help you get better"! She stated to me you’ll receive medications if I am sent to the ICU unit for breathing problems, she’s all "sir you’re fine", that’s a whole 'nother situation so verbally I had backed away.</br></br>You know she’s union blah, blah, blah! Even though this prison tried to help us inmates, some inmates and correctional officers perished, during this pandemic! It was great to feel like we're being helped even though we weren’t, these correctional nurses did their rounds, constantly asking us sick people if we are fine can we breathe properly!
