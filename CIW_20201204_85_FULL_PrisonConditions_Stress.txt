To: whom this may concern</br></br>I am serving 15 to life at 66 percent my MEDP was 9-2018 I have been a extremely extraordinary inmate. I have been recommended for 1170 (d) resentencing. The board of parole keeps rolling me over due to it was a cold case.</br></br>It has been extremely difficult for me, for example today we are lockdown due to COVID and free world staff made a mistake and mixed the units at canteen. I'm unable to clean my room, wash dirty clothes, call my family. I'm so scared of getting sick in here. They will lock us up in quarantine unit that is filthy, cold, no cleaning supplies, Lord no heat.</br></br>My family is waiting patiently to visit. It difficult dealing with yet another loss, with no phone contact. I have been coping with this crisis by staying in my room, wearing my mask at all times.</br></br> 

They make us work as a drug and alcohol counselor with other units. I pray that no student comes in sick, when I am working.</br></br>As a African American, allergies, low blood pressure, I pray that I'm released without catching COVID-19.</br></br>Thank you for your time and consideration listening to my concerns.
