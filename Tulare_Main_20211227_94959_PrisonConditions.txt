This story was told by a person incarcerated at Tulare County Jail.</br></br>

Caller: I didn’t see a lot of people - or I didn’t see anybody who had COVID.</br></br>

UCI: Gotcha. Not many people had COVID in your facility?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, no.</br></br>

UCI: Interesting.</br></br>

Caller: Well you get tested. You gotta get tested in there, I don't know if you’re aware.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah. So, I don’t want to say that’s an anomaly because everyone who’s told me has said that it was a rather fast spreading situation, so what measures did they take to make sure that it wasn’t an extremely volatile situation? What precautions would you say that other facilities need to take to have similar success as yours?</br></br>

Caller: Well, from what you first said, the tests. So yeah, so the tests, the COVID testing, I mean that I’m pretty sure helps. They test you, when I was in pre-trial the quarantine unit.</br></br>

UCI: Gotcha.</br></br>

Caller: I don’t know if anyone told you that. I know this is your guys’ hotline.</br></br>

UCI: So you would say the testing. The -</br></br>

Caller: Yeah the testing, like the precautions, you know, giving people COVID tests. So yeah.</br></br>

UCI: Would you say the vaccine situation helped in your facility?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah I’m sure, I’m sure it helped. I didn’t get vaccinated but.</br></br>

UCI: Gotcha. How was that vaccine situation in your facility? If you are aware. Like describe it to me.</br></br>

Caller: The vaccine situation so, the workers, they would give you a walk around and give you information and like the medical staff.</br></br>

UCI: Gotcha. So this is like an intense situation, so how have you been coping with this situation?</br></br>

Caller: Just, well I mean I got out - I got out so I guess, you know, spending time with family, the holidays. I had to spend Thanksgiving in there so I mean that was rough, but -.</br></br>

UCI: Well that sounds like you’ve been coping relatively well.</br></br>

Caller: I also like exercising.
