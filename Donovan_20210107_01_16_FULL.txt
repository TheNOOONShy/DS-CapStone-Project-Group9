This story was told by a person incarcerated at Donovan.</br></br>

I am here at R.J. Donovan, main facility. On December 12th, December 10th, we had an outbreak of isolated inmates in building one and two with COVID. The CDCR acted appropriately by quarantining the building.</br></br>

Then it spreaded from free staff from the central kitchen into buildings three, four, and five. We tested in my building four on December 15th. Over 40 inmates tested. Four inmates came back positive for COVID-19 on December 15th.</br></br>

The CDCR did not remove anybody from the building. They left them here to come out, touch the railing, use the phones, share the showers, walk out, breathe on every inmate. By December 17th, the entire building was infected.</br></br>

Over 160 inmates. I, who has tested on December 15th negative, contracted COVID by December 17th. And I went man down on December 20th at approximately 7:45 p.m. When I went man down, the nurse came and see me, took my vitals and oxygen levels, and she told me, in unknown certain terms, that the infirmary was overloaded with inmates. And that she, there was really nothing that she could do for me.</br></br>

She couldn't provide any medication. I told her I was, I couldn't breathe. I was dizzy, vomiting, had fever, chills. She suggested to me that I go back to my cell and if it got worse to go man down again.</br></br>

She then did something outrageous. She asked me to file a medical refusal form, which was blank and that she would put in there that I was reporting food poisoning. And then, that's exactly what she did.</br></br>

Then sent me back to my housing unit knowing that I was COVID infected. This occurred in this building — unit four — several times. Other inmates experienced the same thing. And then the outbreak itself was repeating, the cycle was repeating itself on this facility as all five buildings were infected. Over 900-plus inmates.</br></br>

And this is facts. Most of the infection was coming from free staff in the central kitchen. They were allowing inmates to go to work who were contaminated and they were contaminating our food. This is an ongoing problem right now. And five inmates in my building alone have died since December 15th.</br></br>

And there was a report of four or three other inmates that are currently under severe critical care in the San Diego hospital right now from my building alone. A release, press release to the San Diego County press, telling them that, you know, 300-400 inmates were infected with COVID-19 which is an outrageous lie. The entire population, and I’ve talked to several inmates on every yard and they’ve also experienced the same thing.</br></br>

Now, between December 12th and December 20- 29th or the 30th, we have a complete collapse here on this institution. Each yard employs 32 officers per watch. Per watch. And that's on a normal shift. Between December 12th and December 20- 29th and 30th, there was no more than 10 officers on this yard, on any time, at any watch.</br></br>

Five officers during, getting the guards hours of these buildings— five buildings— and only five officers for the whole yard on every watch. Trash, trash was stockpiled in front of each housing unit, eight feet high. There was a total collapse. There was no officers, no wardens, nobody wanted to come check on this.</br></br>

They weren't even testing anybody at the, during the pinnacle of the outbreak itself. And now we're still dealing with them. A couple days ago, which was January 3rd, they came around with these panels that they manufactured in the program office telling us to sign them knowing that we're willingly living amongst COVID-19, that other inmates are infected, and if we don't sign them we're going to be moved.</br></br>

And this is outrageous because we're forced to sign them relinquishing the CDCR from liability 'cause that's all they ever cared about. And the problem with that is that if we didn't sign them, then we were subject to be moved to another contaminated building or contaminated cell from an another infected inmate. Nobody wants to move. Everybody's hunkered down in their cells.</br></br>

They're scared to eat the food. They're scared to do anything. So, I'm asking that the Marshall Project and AMEND, AMEND, a-m-e-n-d.us.org, get involved immediately here, because several people died and we're still at risk because, and I almost died in my cell.</br></br> 

And I'm a lifer for a nonviolent crime. I've been down the third strike for 27 years. And they've done nothing to advance my parole hearing to allow me to show that I’m rehabilitated, and get out of here.</br></br>

You've got guys that are 90 days to the house, and they're not reviewing them. Everybody here should have an equal opportunity to be reviewed for release because there's nothing they can do to protect us.</br></br>

Here at R.J. Donovan we have a total utter collapse. The system failed, people died, and the families that died, the inmates that died of the grieving ones, they need to know the truth. They need to know the truth.</br></br>

The public needs to know the truth. And this is beyond deplorable what I witnessed. It is a humanitarian crisis. And the public needs to know about that. And you can use my name. I don't care. I already filed a lawsuit.</br></br>

I'm in the courts right now. I have several declarations from over 50 inmates. And they've seen it too. And I'm encouraging everybody to call this line, so that the public understands they are misrepresenting the facts, the truth, and the statistics.</br></br>

Between December 15th, and the outbreak at its pinnacle, December 30th, they didn't even come in doing rounds, they weren't checking on inmates. My building alone reported over 17 medical duress alarms resulting in critical care. So, this is the facts, it’s not fiction. And I hope that you people were able to, to do something about it.
