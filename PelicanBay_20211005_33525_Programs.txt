This story was told by a person incarcerated at Pelican Bay.</br></br>

Caller: Well, since the pandemic happened, it's really been no type of education program offered at all. You know what I'm saying? So everything, pretty much, they shut down - it's since like May of last year. You know what I'm saying?</br></br>

The only thing that's really being offered is like medical services. You know what I'm saying? But the only medical services that's really being offered are like urgent emergency medical situations though. You know what I'm saying?</br></br>

UCI: Okay.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah. So that's basically the only type of program, no religious services are really not being offered either, though.</br></br>

UCI: Oh.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah. Yup. Religious services are not being offered. The chaplain supposed to come around everydayâ€”well, they supposed to come around every week and make rounds. And they're not doing that either, though. You know what I'm saying?</br></br>

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: So that's basically going on.
