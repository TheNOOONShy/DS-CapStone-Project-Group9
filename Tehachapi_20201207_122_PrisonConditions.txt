The most recent pandemic in society today is hard alone, less as an inmate residing in an institution under restricted means such as showers and movement.</br></br> 

For the reason of the situation, one would be inclined to believe more showers and less movement would concur. The inability to access the phone is a hardship in itself, wondering if family members are okay and what might they be facing. The experience is not only a difficult one but a troubling one as well.
