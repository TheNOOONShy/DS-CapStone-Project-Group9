To UC Irvine Students,</br></br>

Hello. Well, I been a prisoner in California since 2003. I had a release day in 2016, which I committed a big mistake and caught another case inside prison walls. Now, I took a deal of 15 years, which I’m here on a non-violent case. Yes, 15 years on a non-violence case.</br></br>

Well, as we sit here now in 2020 and the world faced a pandemic crisis as people inside prison walls, all we do is watch the news and pray our loved ones are okay with good health and spirits. It's been a difficult year knowing I caught the virus in August or September.</br></br>

I’ve always been a person that’s very conservative. I don’t like to complain or say much…And to go through the pain of this horrible virus and to know there’s no cure for it. Righteously, it scared me knowing I could’ve died of this… But I thank God every day I got better and as of now I feel better.</br></br>

What I don’t agree is how CDCP went about it — the movements they had going in here was a way they just spread the virus like wildfire. It’s sad cuz people righteously got very sick through all this. As we speak, people are still sick, people have lost their lives on this.</br></br>

And the way medical staff have gone about I’m not saying careless, because I can only imagine how much they have on their plate, I have family in the medical field. My sisters are nurses. I have nieces as well in the medical field. It’s been a tough year for them, so I can only imagine how difficult it is, but there should be certain ways of going about things.</br></br>

Especially, to know that how serious this is. As well to know we want our loved ones to know how we are, how we’re doing. They have gone about this so difficult for everyone. It’s sad to see people got sick from them making inconsiderate mistakes.</br></br>

As for myself, the time I caught this, I won’t lie, I don’t wish it on my worst enemy. It was painful in all ways. The body ache, the tasting of food smell, the gasping for air, it was horrible. As of today, I’m still not 100 percent back to normal.</br></br>

I sometimes think it’s from the virus. But all we do is sit here and hope for better days and pray the man upstairs has a better plan for all of us. I hope this short story will help so when things happen we can be treated like we are worthy, cuz we do have family that love us and care for us…</br></br>

We are praying our dues of mistakes we have committed and we deserve a second chance in life. Like I said I’m doing 15 years on a non-violent case. I asked to consider that and they haven’t even wrote me back. In a letter, I asked Sacramento to review my case, asking for a second chance.</br></br>

But I want to end this and say thank you to UC Irvine for even if it’s so small, but to know someone cares. May God bless you and continue the great work. Thank blessings to all. Happy holidays.</br></br>

Sincerely.
