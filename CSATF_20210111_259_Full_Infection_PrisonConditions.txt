Dear UCI Student,</br></br>

Hope and pray you are doing good. I want to thank you for your words of encouragement for this hard time. Thanks for thinking about us.</br></br>

For us it didn't get hard until November 2020. Once one person got COVID-19, it spread like wildfire. We were moved around all over this yard and other yards.</br></br>

Today things seem to be getting better. Little by little we're going back to program, live getting yard time, going back to chow hall. It is hard to work out and run with a mask, a mask on. Overall, it is okay.</br></br>

I do feel safe. As long as inmates don't get COVID-19 again, we'll be okay. It is hard, though, to not be able to get visits from my family. But they have opened the video-calls family visits.</br></br>

In a way I feel better to have tested positive, this way we can settle down and start programming again.</br></br>

It was a bit scary to have COVID-19 for couple of weeks, but I came out okay.</br></br>

Thanks for your wishes and thoughts.</br></br>

Sincerely.
