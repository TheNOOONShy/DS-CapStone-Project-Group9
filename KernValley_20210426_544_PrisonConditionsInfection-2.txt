UCI: Yes.</br></br> 


Caller: Well I'm on a level 4 facility so I eat in my cell, they bring food to the cell.</br></br>  


UCI: Okay for sure, and so since you're probably getting vaccinated now how has the vaccination situation been like in your facility?</br></br>  


Caller: They've been coming, my celly got one done twice, I’ve refused it I don't want it. For my own reasons, but yeah my celly got his twice. I think it was the Moderna one.</br></br>

Caller: I mean it's kinda difficult, you know what I mean dealing with stuff around here like as far as the program, canteen and other privileges and you know visiting stuff like that's been kinda rough. But I mean everybody been going through it so what, who am I to complain in that regard like that, it's just not, it wasn't, it just didn’t affect prisoners, it affected y’all in the streets as well.</br></br>
