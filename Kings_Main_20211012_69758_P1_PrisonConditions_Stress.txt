This story was told by a person incarcerated at Kings County Jail.</br></br>

Caller: All right. Yeah, I was just touching bases on, I guess, well, just the prison, just the way that we, people interact with each other, the deputies, correctional officers. It's – it’s imperative.</br></br>

I'm not wanting to sit there and point fingers of they’re doing this, they’re doing that cause you know it – it was said to me that you know when you point the blame at other people, you know – stop pointing the blame on other people basically because I have my own faults, you know?</br></br>

Who am I? I was just telling her that you know none of us are faultless. None of us are without fault, you know? So it’s – it’s – it's things that I want to bring to the light, though.</br></br> 

I - even my behavior, things that I struggle with, you know. It's real, you know? It's real the things I struggle with. It’s real, you know?</br></br>

It's something that – that you know – it’s nothing that can't be – you know – corrected or and — and worked on, you know? But it’s – I think we all have a - you know – I think we all have a, you know, me personally, I think we have a duty to come together and just - just, you know, try to help each other.</br></br> 

In here, you know, I've had times where I had outbursts, talked to some of the staff members in a way that wasn't appropriate cause I was upset. I was upset and I felt — I felt overwhelmed. I felt like people weren't hearing me; people weren't listening.</br></br>

More so I guess I kinda hold them, you know? I was – I was blaming them – blaming a lot of people for things that I had going on, but in a place like this, you wanna, it just – they have a tendency, like I was telling her, you have a tendency to be complacent and just talk to people in a rude way, you know?</br></br>

When they want you to do something or they ask you to do something, sometimes the person gets tired, they don't want to keep having to repeat themselves – themselves to you, and then they’ll – so they'll yell at you or they’ll, you know, talk to you in a way of – you know – "Get your F'ing"; you know, F word and stuff like that.</br></br>

Yesterday, they were asking people to go to the – go to the yard, you know, because they were doing searches, you know? And the senior deputy, you know, talked to a gentleman in a disrespectful voice, in a disrespectful way.</br></br> 

That wasn't necessary, you know? Cussed at him and yelled – yelled at him in like – like if he was – he was just garbage, you know? You can’t, you can’t – I mean, you can, you can do anything you want to, but it's not right to talk to people in that – in that way.</br></br>

Because there's nothing that we can — that you can do – that we can do as incarcerated, there’s nothing that we can do to these – to these deputies or people that work here when they talk to us in this way. There’s nothing that you can – you can file a grievance, but nothing really – nothing is gonna happen from it. Nothing is gonna come from it, you know?</br></br>

But when we do something – say something disrespectful to them, or use the wrong terminology, or say something off the wall, you know? They'll write us up. They'll take our dayroom time, take our yard, you know? They'll take things from us.</br></br>

What are you taking from them? What happens to them? Nothing, you know? So, you're kind of like in a lose-lose situation.</br></br>

There's nothing you can do but just take the – take the verbal abuse, take mental abuse. And to some of us – there’s some of those that have mental health issues, and some people can't handle that. And that's the honest to God truth. Some people can't handle that.
