This letter was written by a person incarcerated at SATF (California Substance Abuse Treatment Facility and State Prison).</br></br>

So right after I got here I celled up with a guy from my city that I know from the streets. Well he worked in the kitchen and was exposed to the COVID. Well long story short, we both knew we had it so we stayed in our style. And one day the cops came to our cell telling us we need to be separated due to my cell being exposed to someone who had the COVID (two weeks after we knew we had it).</br></br> 

So we both told the cops we know we have it so might as well just keep us together (they wanted to move us both with other people).</br></br>

So we both refused to move and cell up with other people who don't have the COVID (the right thing to do and the nurse here told us the same thing). So we both were written up and had three more months added to my time.</br></br>

Well we were both moved to building one (and new quarantine building made for possibly infected inmates). We were there celled up for a few days until they gave us a COVID test in which we both tested positive. Well they moved us to building two (the new quarantine building again, yes a new one) and single-celled us.</br></br>

I stayed on quarantine for a month until I tested negative for the COVID. Well it doesn't end there, during the whole time on quarantine I wasn't able to use the phone to call my family, go to yard, or receive any packages that my family ordered me. Even when you're in the hole or shu you're able to get yard. And I was on quarantine not for disciplinary issues and I couldn't get what I'm entitled to.</br></br>

So after I got off quarantine I was moved into another cell with a random inmate who I lived with for about three months. Well, this idiot asks the kitchen workers to get him a job for him. After I told him that the job is the main one where everyone's catching the virus. Well, he gets the job, and this is right around Thanksgiving.</br></br> 

It's cold as hell outside and the AC is blowing hella hard so it's freezing and we both catch a cold.</br></br>
,
I told him do not go to work 'cause they're going to assume you have the COVID and quarantine both of us. The idiot doesn't listen and he comes back from work an hour later and says they're going to quarantine us so I said, “Why do you say that?” He says, “I coughed in front of my boss, so they sent me to medical and I told them I have COVID symptoms.” So there I go, back on quarantine and moved to D-yard (level four).</br></br> 

I spent my first five years on a level four 180 design yard at Kern Valley and I just came to a level three yard so I'm mad. Well we get to D-yard and he's my neighbor now. We both tested negative, but D-yard is on lockdown ‘cause four of the five buildings tested positive. Well, he's not a clean person and catches the COVID on D-yard.</br></br> 

So they moved me to the building where people test negative go.</br></br>

Well one day I am called to the program office where the captain, lieutenant, and two sergeants are waiting for me. I'm assuming the worst, another death my family. Well long story short I find out someone who testified me on my case is on that yard and fears for his life so they tell me I'm going back to the hole.</br></br> 

Well I'm not stupid and speak my mind so I say, “You can't send me to the hole.” They tell me, “Well you guys can't be on the same yard so you have to go to the hole.” So I say, “I’m not supposed to even be on this yard. I'm a level three.” So they check and see that I'm telling the truth, and I am immediately moved back to my regular yard.</br></br> 

And my quarantine starts all over again.
