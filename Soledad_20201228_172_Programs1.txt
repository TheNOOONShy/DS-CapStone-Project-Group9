This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Soledad.</br></br>

Some of the facilities have video visits set up and/or they have these Jpay tablets that when standing next to kiosks inmates can send or receive 30 second videos to and from their loved ones. This facility is so old, outdated, and run down it isn't even set up for either of the two.</br></br> 

Phone calls come once in a great while in this facility because the phones are outside on the yard and since we donâ€™t have the yard privilege right now, we have to wait for them to approve phone calls. So trying to maintain a healthy relationship with loved ones on the outside has become more challenging.
