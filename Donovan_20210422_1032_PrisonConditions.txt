This story was told by a person incarcerated at Donovan.</br></br>Caller: And then once, once people started getting infected, there wasn't really much that anyone can do about it, we weren't really getting any kind of treatment, other than temperature check. And you know, that a lot of times our gloves weren't being changed out in between COVID tests, the nurses were using the same gloves to just go from one cell to the next. And I noticed that the porters in the building, they weren't being given our proper disinfectant.</br></br>Caller: I work in the clinic so I know that we need 64 Cell Block to kill those kind of viruses. And I you know, I watched the porters cleaning with Breakout, legit a degreaser. And they weren't being given rags, a lot of them will just wipe down the phones with with the same rags, just renting them out doing as much as they can, with their own, you know, [unintelligible] since renting out their towels and stuff.</br></br>Caller: And it was a scary situation, because I've never been through something like this. And I've never really thought that a prison can get shut down like that, like statewide. So there was a lot of things going on that we just, it was the unknown. I think that was kind of difficult for everybody. You know, guys started committing suicide more than before COVID on this yard, and I've personally had to clean up one last week in one building, blood everywhere, it was kind of kind of sick man, you know, was nasty having to clean that up.</br></br>Caller: Since I work in the clinic, you know, we're trained to, to pick a biohazard and all that, uh, as I was cleaning it up, another guy cut his throat in another cell. So it's like, people are going through a lot of mental health issues, and they don't have no one to talk to. Now that is getting a little bit better. You know, I guess they have more clinicians coming in and stuff like that. But just as we're getting better now we're back to this 14 day quarantine.</br></br>Caller: So it's really hard on, on people not being able to see friends from other buildings as well that, you know, some there's a lot of guys that I played music with, that I used to socialize with, and, and I wasn’t unable to talk to those guys anymore. And like, we're, each building was kind of living in their own world, because we don't get to see the other buildings. So it was it was difficult seeing guys pass away that that I actually sat there and played guitar with one that was in one of my music programs. You know, just they were at churches knowing that they were just here and all of a, a sudden this pandemic hit that everyone at times didn't know if it was real, or if it was true, or if it was going to get into the prison.</br></br>
