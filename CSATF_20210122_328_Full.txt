To whom it may concern,</br></br>

Hi How are you? I want to respectfully say that I'm appreciative of the thought you have and the people amongst you for having such a caring heart to take the time out of your daily activities to write a letter this way, so thank you very much.</br></br>

I am an inmate that's been incarcerated 17 years and counting during my stay of these incarcerated walls. I do my best to remain optimistic within daily experiences all the way around.</br></br>

So with the practice set in mind in advance, luckily it gives me the energy to strive into our future healthily determined that things can and will get better not only oneself here but there's enough of betterness to be scattered everywhere just as I feel the better happiness of reality's activities.</br></br>

Equal share spread throughout everyone's mind/spirit state of being, that's a precious rewarding and I believe 2021 will be the start into a newer pace of healthier living in hopes that all will join to stay fit physically as mentally that way it excludes the virus from entering anywhere in our spaces.</br></br>

This COVID has no right interfering and trying to hold us people back from freedom to live freely. We as people are allowed to control our own bodies, not allow this germ to determine whether we can kiss our spouse and what timing we can kiss our loved ones.</br></br>

No. This is an example but also the truth. We are in control of our name of person, right? Well I hate to be bringing this letter to a close for now, but not for long.</br></br>

I will be in touch again shortly. Until then, may the best of health wishes be shared in your direction and those amongst you.</br></br>

Hearts of full health happiness is hoped there. May the good lord's blessings be conferred upon all in these critical virus time. Amen.</br></br>

Thank you.</br></br>

Respectfully yours.
