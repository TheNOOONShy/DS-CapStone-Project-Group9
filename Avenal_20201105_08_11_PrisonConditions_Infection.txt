This story was told by a person incarcerated at Avenal.</br></br>UCI: If possible, could you please tell me, tell us, month-by-month, how the situation has changed at your facility?</br></br>
Caller: Yes. In the very beginning, when we had the first few outbreaks on the yard, we have four buildings on our yard, and there were outbreaks in two of the buildings. And the only action to really separate people, at that point, was to stop the intermingling of buildings, at the dining hall and at yard. But there was no separation within the building itself.</br></br>They would say that a particular dorm was on quarantine but they were allowed to, you know, go out into the dayroom. And they may have had their meals delivered, but they came out to the dayroom at the table with other inmates. So there was no separation in keeping those infected away from those that, you know, had not been infected yet.</br></br>
As things progressed into, say, May, in that area, all four buildings on the yard were heavily infected. With at least 60 percent of the people testing positive when they tested the entire yard. And 60 to 70 percent tested positive at that point.</br></br>And they, again, made no moves, just everybody that was negative just stayed exactly where they were at, surrounded by those that were positive. And, as I said, more people that tested negative in that initial testing became sick.</br></br>
And, eventually, you know, the rates are up to over 80 percent of the population, here, on this yard, has, at one time or another, tested positive now. And there's only, I know, there's only approximately 30 people within our building.</br></br>And other buildings are at about the same numbers. So it's, you know, 80 to 85 percent, now, that have, you know, contracted the COVID virus.</br></br>
So it wasn't until right around the end of August that they started testing all of the negative people. You know, after that initial test in about May or so, there was nobody being tested at all, you know, and until it was around sometime in August, either the end of July or sometime in August, that they started testing the negatives on a weekly basis.</br></br>And so that's kind of where we stand now. When somebody does come up positive, they, you know, as I said, they move them off to another yard. And, also, their dorm mates are moved to a separate yard, where they are quarantined for two weeks. And then, you know, hopefully, at that point, they will come back and regain their positions in the dorm that they left.</br></br>UCI: Got it.</br></br>Caller: That’s kind of where we're at now.
