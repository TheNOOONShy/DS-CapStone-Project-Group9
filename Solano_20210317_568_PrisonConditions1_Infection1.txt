This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Solano.</br></br>Anyways, I see you’re a college student too. I just graduated with Dean's Honors myself. Your team is what? Sociologists? In CDCR now, having infected all of us here at Solano, are trying to reach hard-status in doing so.</br></br>They moved or transferred inmates from two institutions in particular, doing so and although, claiming these inmates were tested prior to arresting and being placed among us in dorm situations with barely three feet separation from the persons to the right and left sides of you. Reminder, we are double bunk bed already too.</br></br> Once they realized we were being subjected to these new arrivals, they began testing us all. This was in January of 2021. Someone in the archaic medical system, along with custody and warden Matheson came up with a scheme of moving us from buildings to others as isolations cells instead.</br></br>Once there for me, they tested us at 8:45 pm, then at 5 am, told us I’ve tested positive and moved us units into a gym that housed positive inmates already. Now, we never received any form of positive testing, nor do we know the tests ratios for false positives possibilities.
