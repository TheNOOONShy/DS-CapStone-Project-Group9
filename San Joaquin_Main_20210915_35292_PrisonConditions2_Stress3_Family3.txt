This story was told by an incarcerated individual at San Joaquin County Jail.</br></br>

Caller: But one thing I can tell you that happened to me while having been locked up in jail this time around, and it's most – and it most definitely is something worth writing about is probably what has turned out to be one of the more inspiring things that has ever happened to me, and that would be to tell you how when I first came into jail I brought with me just four stories that I held close to my heart having written them during my other visits.</br></br>

Originally, [unintelligible] had been written primarily for my family and close friends, but then something very amazing happened where just as I finished writing my latest and greatest story ever called – ever called Faith in Humanity that I was so proud of, the people in my jail pod even began receiving letters from [unintelligible] asking inmates for their stories about the [unintelligible] pandemic expressing their concern for our well-being and about the different ways in which [unintelligible] may have suffered [unintelligible] this as a result with them wanting to - to then take the stories they receive and make their best effort in attempting to change reforms for inmates having true compassion for others and just wanting to help make the world a better place, which is something I can appreciate and value so highly as it's what I'm all about.</br></br>

So with that, I then had inmates running these letters over to me and showing me how cool this was and knowing this was – this was meant for me as for weeks now I had already been passing my stories around the jail to be read as many of these men have now become my friends and I wished to help them – I wished to help them all with their frame of mind and holding proper perspective on things. So when I received this letter, I became very excited [unintelligible] of being able to branch out to a larger audience and having my message heard now by me.</br></br>

It was exactly what I had needed [unintelligible] wanting to do a large amount of good in this world without exactly knowing how. [unintelligible] the possibility of stories being shared – with the possibility of these stories being [unintelligible] an upcoming generation at the time well – while – while they are also able to take their leap and – and making a difference around them.</br></br>

Even further, with these stories now being shared by all future [unintelligible] is – is and was my [unintelligible] it can easily stand as the most divine thing to happen to me. [unintelligible] changed my entire [unintelligible] about things and all the possibilities that may be my future as I am now in debt to them for this inspiring kind gesture that they have extended to all of us in the – in the [unintelligible] improve the world around them.</br></br>

It's a debt I can never stop repaying as they have likely now changed the entire course of my existence with them having inspired me to continue writing and to continue writing in a way I had never done before whereas my first stories had happened as being written one at a time separately over the course of a year or more, but I am now able to write a new story every night with me being able to write 10 to 15 pages a day or more. It's as if I can't stop writing; like, I'll no longer know what to do with myself if I stop.
