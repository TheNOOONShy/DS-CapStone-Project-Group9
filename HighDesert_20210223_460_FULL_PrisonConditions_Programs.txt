This letter was written by a person incarcerated at High Desert.</br></br>I received your beautiful political pamphlet. That asked me about my experience, dealing with this pandemic, inside of prison. While living in prison I had to deal with the warden spreading COVID-19 to prisoners by not isolating other prisoners that was exposed to COVID-19.</br></br>  

Along with stopping, inmates from prevailing, in their academic, by giving prisoners a deadline, on their homework, and test, and making it very difficult for prisoners, to turn in their school work. For they can fail.</br></br> 

By making prison more emotional and stressful environment. Where human life, it’s nothing more than a property, and the value is nothing!</br></br>Poem</br></br>
To the greatest and brilliant minds ever that can’t discover the truth</br></br>
It’s like a mystery to their intelligence still searching for something they can’t find.</br></br>
Only to know life is meaningless unless people find some meaning to live!
