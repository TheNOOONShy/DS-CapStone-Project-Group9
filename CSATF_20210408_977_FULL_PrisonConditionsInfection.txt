“The COVID-19 Crisis”</br></br> 

Well to say the least I’ve been stressed out behind the COVID-19 viral pandemic. It’s been hectic. I have to wear my mask whenever I’m away from my bed area. It’s a nuisance. I need to wash my hands after every use of the restroom. I need to practice social distancing of six feet apart even when I sleep.</br></br>

In March 2021, I received my second dose of the Pfizer vaccine. Prior to that reception I was a nervous wreck. I was paranoid about getting re-infected after my September 2020 initial infection. I literally thought I was going to die from the infection.</br></br>

I never got visits in prison. You can’t miss something that you never had before. I take the crisis one day at a time. I practice the virtue of staying safe. I stay in contact with family via telephone and writing.</br></br>

I pray to the Lord Jesus Christ everyday. I keep my faith. I don’t give up on us as a human race. Hey! Hey!</br></br>

Sincerely.
