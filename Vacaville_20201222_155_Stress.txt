They've never felt solitary time, 24/7 lock downs, no access to education, therapy, self-help groups, job assignments, social or recreational time. Nothing. And I'm starting to see that it takes a toll. Substance abuse is higher, people are losing sober time to the fear, boredom, and uncertainty. The smallest things are triggering pent up anger in everyone. One can smell the fear and depression like a heavy chemical, and some of these prisoners will be released during these times, less prepared than they might have been were they given the proper services and support.
