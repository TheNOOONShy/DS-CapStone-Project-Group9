This story was told by an incarcerated individual at San Joaquin County Jail.</br></br>

Caller: I'm finding out that if [unintelligible] and even then as I'm writing these stories about my life, remembering [unintelligible] some things as I go.[unintelligible] I'm finding out that as – that as I'm coming up with these – with the topic and even as I'm writing these stories about my life that I'm remembering some things as I go – things that are shocking, even for myself, that had been long forgotten almost as if from a past life long ago, and I'm then able to reassociate myself with these parts of myself that I so treasure having lived through and experiences I've had.</br></br>

Especially by writing about so many different times so fast, I'm now able to once again carry with me all those experiences as if they just happened with them all now being centered at the front of my brain all – and daily – at the front of my brain and daily thought process. In a sense, I had now reinforced myself with all that I've ever done and all that I am combined into one in every moment of my day carrying it all with me now with every step I take. It almost feels like some sort of superpower with the life the way I've lived it.</br></br>

It's incredible, really, and has lifted my self-consciousness to a high – to a new level. It's a wonderful feeling being able to express myself so easily and so well, even now having the ability to explain and write about the great pleasure about all the topics I have written, including this very [unintelligible] now writing as I'm writing it feels very special as perhaps it has never [unintelligible] as I once drew a picture inside of a picture of a pitcher taking a [unintelligible] of a picture on a table of a pitcher of beer [unintelligible] and it does this – and so – and so does this here now.</br></br>

It could be a new style of art [unintelligible] in a gallery without title and have [unintelligible] what they think it is. Curious as to how many people could get it completely correct. I believe I [unintelligible] picture when I was 16 – about 16 years old, and I've always been very fond of it, and [unintelligible] having drawn it in the first place.</br></br>

I have not thought about it for [unintelligible] I'm adding to my [unintelligible] now finally having said all that [unintelligible] again, deeply thank [unintelligible] for all that they've done and all that they are doing [unintelligible] a lot of us here – over here whereas for me, I've never enjoyed the experience of having [unintelligible] to wonder what it might have been like for me had I [unintelligible] that I still love to learn [unintelligible] because remember, knowledge is the greatest tool and the greatest strength you could ever [unintelligible] in this life.</br></br>

It is and will always be a true power, and really – and really take the time to value and appreciate where you're at and yourself for being there. We are [unintelligible] doing. You have now single handedly, or at least with all hands combined, changed my life by [unintelligible] changed my life by [unintelligible] – all right.</br></br>

Changed my life by creating this up – an uplifting experience of being here in jail that [unintelligible] otherwise gone to waste. By then, instead, making it so I leave here such a proud man. When we first met I had read for you no more than 40 pages or so – oh, I'm sorry.</br></br>

When we first met, I had ready for you no more than 40 or so pages of literature that I had written to – to read to you and others, but after I finished writing and then telling this story here now – but after I finished writing and then telling this story here now to you, I will have written and read a total of 140 – 140 pages to you that I now carry with me as a book that would have never possibly happened without you.
