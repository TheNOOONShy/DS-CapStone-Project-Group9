Hello PrisonPandemic,</br></br>

It is a very good deed you and your classmate are doing. First of all what is the class you’re taking. What can a young woman like you, hope to gain from our encounter. Anyways my story about me and COVID-19, while incarcerated is somewhat of a nightmare that seems to never end.</br></br>

I’ve seen people, inmates and CDCR staff members whom have been infected with COVID-19, I myself I’m immune to it. I've had various issues of other problems, I started 2021, in tumult, being in prison is never a good situation, it is as I say, one step from being deceased.</br></br>

Young people, believe this, prison is no place you would want to be. You’ll run into every kind God’s created beings, and most of them will not have your best interest in their mind. You may find something in the food you have to eat, or you may have to fight, to death.</br></br>

And then there are officers whom may not like you at all, whom may assault you. I’ve only a few more years, I’ll get out walking, or dead on my back. Pay attention, I’m living proof, prison is no good for any person, with good moral principles.</br></br>

I pray that this one page warning will help some young people, and in doing so help them make good decent decisions in their lives. Remember one mistake is all it takes, to become a prison inmate. Love you all, keeping you in my prayers.</br></br>

PS do the right things.
