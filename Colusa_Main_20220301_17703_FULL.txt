This story was told by a person incarcerated at Colusa County Jail.</br></br>

UCI: All right, what has the COVID situation been like at your facility?</br></br>

Caller: We always have to wear masks when we leave the cell. Other than that, I’ve gotten — when I went to medical, they asked me if I wanted the COVID shot. I said, "Yeah," but they never gave it to me and it’s kind of dirty in here, I guess. Not really clean, nothing really sanitary and we have things on the wall, but they don't, they don’t get used and they don't get re-, like restocked, I guess.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>

Caller: And yeah, that’s about it, I guess. Nothing gets wiped down, everything stays gross.</br></br>

UCI: And do you think if you asked for sanitizing materials that they’d provide them?</br></br>

Caller: When they were, when they were ready to give it to us, but probably takes a minute to get anything to us really.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>

Caller: I’ve asked for cleaning supplies and it takes at least a day or two to get it to us.</br></br>

UCI: Thank you. And have they offered you the vaccine again, or is that something you would have to keep asking for?</br></br>

Caller: I think, well, I’ve asked for it twice already and they said, "Yeah," when they one time comes. But they never gave it to me yet. I would like it. But I've been trying to get it. Due, if I got sick in here I don't want to stay sick and I didn’t want to —</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>

Caller: Get sick and die. That's why I thought about it and I've asked them about it twice and I still haven’t got it.</br></br>

UCI: Have they administered it to other people there?</br></br>

Caller: She asked us about it, so I’m not sure if she has or not. But I believe - hey, has anybody got the COVID shot, have you guys haven’t got it yet. But have they asked us, because I have asked about it. See they don't, they don’t ask us constantly, no.</br></br>

UCI: Okay.</br></br>

Caller: I asked the — I also went into the doctor I had asked them about it.</br></br>

UCI: And you had said you wear masks, do they provide those for you?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, yeah, every time we come out of our cell.</br></br>

UCI: Oh, you get new ones?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah.</br></br>

UCI: Okay.</br></br>

Caller: That’s why I think that’s the only thing that’s good about that. That's the only thing they do good around here is just give us the masks.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>

Caller: Clean masks.</br></br>

UCI: And then. Oh, so sorry.</br></br>

Caller: Sorry, no go ahead. I said when which was kinda crappy because it's the only time they give us something clean.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah no that’s - what would happen if somebody were to test positive for COVID?</br></br>

Caller: They probably would get moved out. Well, last time I was here, they — when someone tested positive, they just got rolled up and rolled out to the next room. And they didn't even clean or sanitize where they were at, which was in here with us.</br></br>

UCI: And do they come back after quarantining or?</br></br>

Caller: Well, actually I don't even know about that. They probably would’ve, but the girl I think she got released and went home after her court date. But I don’t think it's because of COVID she has to go home.</br></br>

UCI: Oh, okay.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah.</br></br>

UCI: Oh, Sorry.</br></br>

Caller: She was in her own room for a minute.</br></br>

UCI: Okay.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, seven days or so.</br></br>

UCI: And then —</br></br>

Caller: Go ahead, sorry.</br></br>

UCI: How do court visits work at the moment?</br></br>

Caller: Court visits?</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>

Caller: Well, when they call us out to go to court, they give us a mask, and then they shackle us up and take us in a van. Like whoever, however, many people are going to court that day from two to six to four, it doesn’t matter. They just load us up in a van and take us there. And then when we get to the courtroom, we have to have our masks on at all times but that's the only thing.</br></br>

We ride in a dirty van, and we go back to the back of the courthouse into the little rooms, and they're dirty as can be. I don't even think they even get cleaned but they're — yeah, it's kind of dirty. Well, a lot dirty.</br></br>

UCI: Have they refused to take you for COVID related reasons?</br></br>

Caller: No. They’ll just take you and take you and take you until — yeah they don't even, I don’t even think it crosses their mind.</br></br>

UCI: Okay. And how would you say the staff has been handling the situation?</br></br>

Caller: On a scale of one to 10?</br></br>

UCI: Sure.</br></br>

Caller: About a two.</br></br>

UCI: Okay. And what would be your biggest complaints about how they handle it?</br></br>

Caller: Dish out some more sanitizer.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>

Caller: They could take it a little bit serious. People do get it and they do die from it. I hope they know that.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>

Caller: So if they took care of it, maybe it would be a little bit less easier not to catch.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm. Well this has been a lot of great information. Is there anything else you’d like to share about your situation tonight?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah. Maybe you guys can relay the message and tell them to clean up their stuff a little bit.</br></br>

UCI: That's the goal.</br></br>

Caller: That’s right. I appreciate it and that’s all. I have one more girl who wants to talk to you.</br></br>

UCI: Oh. Thank you thank you so much for calling too.</br></br>

Caller: Awesome, you welcome. You have a good night okay.</br></br>

UCI: You too.</br></br>

Caller: Okay hold on. Oh. Can she write a letter to you instead? She’s gonna -</br></br>

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: Sorry.</br></br>

UCI: Of course. Do you have the address?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, we got it on a piece of paper in the mail.</br></br>

UCI: Okay perfect. Yes.</br></br>

Caller: Okay. Okay. And you have a good night. Thank you so very much for all your help.</br></br>

UCI: You too. Thank you to all of you for calling in.</br></br>

Caller: I hope this gets out in the future.</br></br>

UCI: We really hope so.</br></br>

Caller: That’d be great. Much appreciated.</br></br>

UCI: Have a good night.</br></br>

Caller: You too, thank you. Bye.
