This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Calipatria.</br></br>


There are so many things that this prison is doing wrong it’s bad and basically illegal and all they do is blame everything on COVID. Yes some people here have had COVID and they kept us all together luckily me or my celly have not caught it which is a true blessing.</br></br> 


They have tested us all a lot of times most inmates where I’m at have caught it but for the ones that haven’t it seems like we’re being punished.</br></br>


I have heard that certain yards on this prison are having better programs than where I’m at like how we can’t play basketball or have our dayroom time (time out our cell inside our dorm to interact with each other of course safely with our mask on).</br></br>


This has made it very depressing and difficult to get through our days smoothly. We can’t even change out our laundry because we can’t just walk to laundry like we’re supposed to be able to. They do give us disinfectant here but it’s all water down so it’s not getting areas fully clean at all. </br></br>
