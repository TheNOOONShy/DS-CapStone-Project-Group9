This letter was written by a person incarcerated at New Folsom.</br></br>April 19, 2021</br></br>Dear PrisonPandemic,</br></br>I hope by the time this letter comes your way it will find you safe! Well let me first off by sayin I really appreciated you writing me. I been in prison since I was 17 year old. First time ever, PrisonPandemic, I never got out yet.</br></br>I'm really glad you find me on CDCR's website. Yes this difficult time is really been hard for me it's a struggle! So you're a college student? At UCI collecting stories about what has been happening inside facilities. I understand a little bit what's going on.</br></br>I don't really have family like that, my mother passed away, so did my little brother. The only person right now is my older sister, who missing, since 2019. Nobody at this prison has tried to help me find her.</br></br>I have a hard time with spelling, and reading. I been under care in this program, with mental health issues. Taken medication in order to sleep at night. Getting therapy from my clinician speaking with her about my problems and situations.</br></br>Without this COVID-19 things are still difficult thinking about me getting back out again to see my family. Right now my date is 2024. That's not bad. Dealing with depression, anxiety, anger mood swings it's really difficult times.</br></br>Thank you very much PrisonPandemic for writing me. I hope you stay in contact with me. At this time the only time I would be able to use the phone is only on Saturday! I wish I can call Monday-Friday in the morning.</br></br>Well independent college student, take care of yourself. God bless and stay safe! Hope to hear you soon again, let your team know I said hello.</br></br>If you have any other information that can help me out, please don't hesitate to send them, I'll be at this address on the envelope for a while okay! I really appreciated you, believe in me.</br></br>Best wishes. Always. Your friend.
