GTL the phone company has given those who have someone to call 2 free phone calls a month and the government allows prisoners to also collect the economic impact checks as we all have become $320,0.00 richer and in prison believe it or not that is a lot of money. There is also a economy in here. People buy canteen, packages, phone calls, books.</br></br>
