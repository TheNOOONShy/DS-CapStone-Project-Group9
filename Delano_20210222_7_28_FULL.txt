This story was told by a person incarcerated at Delano.</br></br>

Caller: You know the hard thing is here, they just redid phone calls, where phones are cheaper now, but there’s no visits. You know we have no library, nothing like that.</br></br>

UCI: Mmhmm. So how have you personally been coping with the situation?</br></br>

Caller: I have spent about two and a half months out of the last four months in, lock downed in a cell with people they moved in a quote on quote quarantine. And I mean it’s, I’m in here because, I’m here for, never even had a driving ticket in California, I had an assault with a deadly weapon. I had a guy on meth attack me. I used his own knife against him and I didn’t tap out and I got sentenced here. </br></br>

And I’m just - I'm stuck here you know I mean there’s no visits, there’s no family. I mean, it’s like if you don’t have someone send you a book, people are just locked up in here. I mean, and they’ve had about 1,200 people here that have had COVID, I think they’ve only had five deaths. But I’m telling you we were in a building, the only building in the prison with C-1 A and B.</br></br> 

And they had a big outbreak in C-3, they locked them down for 14 days, they took the people who were sick and they put them into our dorm. They didn’t test them again, they didn’t give them any medication, they brought these people who were still sick and it’s like “wow” you know? And I know that everybody’s being affected by this, you know, so I know it’s not just people in here suffering but you know this is, you know somebody is making a whole bunch of money off of this. That’s for sure, you know, and it ain’t us.</br></br>

UCI: Just to clarify, they took a bunch of people who were already infected with COVID and then they placed them with people who didn’t have COVID?</br></br>

Caller: Yes, they did.</br></br> 

UCI: Oh.</br></br>

Caller: This was on C-1. C-3 had the outbreak and I believe the outbreak was like the first week of January. They took everybody out of these buildings and they locked them down to cells and they quarantined them 'cause it was like a dorm setting. They locked them in the cells, they kept the guys who did not have COVID for 19 days.</br></br> 

The guys who had COVID, they took them out after 14 days, they never tested them again and they put them into the only building in the whole prison that didn’t have some type of COVID outbreak.</br></br>

UCI: Mmhmm.

Caller: You know, so-</br></br>

UCI: And-</br></br>

Caller: You know.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah.</br></br> 

Caller: I mean you know we’re pretty much here you know and this is, I’ll be honest with you. This is really, this is really something here, because you know, I mean, they, you know, they come through with tests. They’ve offered people the vaccine, but like there are probably two out of 100 are taking it.</br></br> 

UCI: Oh.</br></br>

Caller: And you know, people really don’t want the vaccine. To be honest with you they don’t come with no tests, you know? It's like, you know, like I said they gave us these, they give us masks, I got my mask, and it’s a cloth mask, I got it about two months ago and I have never been offered a replacement since.</br></br>

UCI: Have you been able to wash the mask? Or do they offer ways to wash the mask?</br></br>

Caller: I mean, I go and I use the state soap they give me, and they go in there and they give us no bleach. You know, they have not come in here and disinfected this wing. So now they moved us back out of C-1 after about two weeks after they brought everybody. They moved people back into this building, they never disinfected this building, they do not offer us any bleach. They give us this sanitary and it’s like 99 percent dilution, you know?</br></br>

UCI: Mmhmm.</br></br>

Caller: Some of the people here, some people got sick and it didn’t really bother them and some people were severely sick for like 10 days but they didn’t, they just left them in the cell. It wasn’t like they didn’t come and say “Here can we give you some vitamins,” "Can we-" you know, they didn’t take people out of the cell when they got sick. Anyone who was quote on quote quarantined gets locked down they do not let them back out of the cells.</br></br>

You know. If you’re on quarantine they will test you, if you didn’t test positive the first time they’ll test you again but anyone who’s tested positive will not be tested again because they say your antibodies will be in you. And then they’ll bring you back out into the population after 14 days.</br></br>

UCI: So do they - when they find that a prisoner has COVID-19 do they treat them differently from other patients besides quarantining them from the rest of the group?</br></br>

Caller: No, they do not even offer them not even a vitamin to take. They don’t offer any type of medication, nothing like that they put them just in a cell and leave them up in there. You know, I’m sure if someone was passed out in a cell they might take somebody out but I do know there’s been five people that have died here. Did they take them to the hospital before they died? I’m not sure, you know?</br></br>

UCI: Mmhmm. And if it’s okay to ask you, a personal question, so how has it-</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, sure.</br></br>

UCI: How has it been like for you to have reduced visitation and programming or visits from your loved ones?</br></br>

Caller: Well you know what I mean, that’s probably, it’s made the irritability and the tension in this place go up like 10 times. You know, people are irritated. You know, I haven’t seen, I haven’t been able to sit there and see my son, have a visit with him or nothing in, you know, 10 months. You know, they were only doing phone calls one day a week, except they put us in these dorms so we can work and it’s supposed to be voluntary.</br></br> 

But they’re saying we couldn’t have phones in there so we all said “Hey we’re not gonna work” and so they gave us more phones only in the last two weeks.</br></br> 

UCI: Mmhmm.</br></br>

Caller: But you know it’s hard you know what I’m saying? I mean it’s bad enough as it is, you know, but not being able to go to library to get books, not being able to have visits. And then just sitting here and being treated like shit. It’s not a good feeling, you know?</br></br>

UCI: Mmhmm.
