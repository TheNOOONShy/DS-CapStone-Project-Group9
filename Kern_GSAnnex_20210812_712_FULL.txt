This story was told by a person incarcerated at an ICE/Private-Contractor facility.</br></br>

UCI: Tell me about your COVID story.</br></br>

Caller: Well, last year while I was in prison around February or March is when, basically, the whole prison that I was in, the dorm that I was in - actually the unit I was in, one person after another started catching it.</br></br> 

And, you know, a lot of people were afraid to, basically, communicate and tell staff that we were catching COVID due to that they were trying to pull us and isolate every single one of us. And they were trying to put us in single cells, and nobody really wanted to speak up and say that they were catching COVID.</br></br>

So, shortly after that, probably a couple weeks later, that's when I caught COVID myself. And, yeah, I mean it was pretty horrible, I mean the pain that we had, you know, the bones just hurting, your skin hurting, the fever you were having. And it probably took the staff about- I don't know, probably close to a month for them to come in and start doing random temperature checks and–</br></br>

UCI: Damn.</br></br>

Caller: -basically checking everybody. Yeah, it took quite a long time for them to come in. And even with just telling them the symptoms you were having, all they were giving you was just Tylenol. They weren't giving you any other kind of treatment, you know?</br></br>

UCI: Damn.</br></br>

Caller: So, for, like, two weeks, I was just eating, I mean eating- I was taking Tylenol and Tylenol just for my fevers and stuff. And that was really it. I mean it was just pretty stressful, you know?</br></br>

UCI: I'm sure.</br></br>

Caller: You're feeling vulnerable. You're just in bed and just fighting through it, really. Just massive headaches. And you could barely get up and just walk around because of those headaches and you feel dizzy.</br></br>

UCI: Well, you must feel like not abandoned but on your own, you know? Even though you have- you must- there must be the resources, but you just don't have access to them.</br></br>

Caller: Right, of course.</br></br>

UCI: What facility did you say you were at?</br></br>

Caller: [redacted].</br></br>

UCI: Okay, thank you. I've just got to make sure I get that. Thanks. So, yeah, man. That sounds crazy.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah. And then, of course, you know, you don't have really anybody to talk to or help you. I mean all you really do is do it all on your own. And it makes it even worse because they want to put you in isolation by yourself even though a lot of the times it's just the whole dorm or it's just even the whole facility's just catching it. And they want to isolate you, and just- that's even worse, you know?</br></br>

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: Mentally, it's worse being by yourself. So, yeah. I mean I don't know what else to say really, because you do it all on your own. You really do.</br></br>

UCI: Dude, I don't even know what that's like. That had to have been a crazy experience.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah.</br></br>

UCI: I mean what was going through your head while that was going on?</br></br>

Caller: Man, you really do feel like you're, like you said, just isolated all on your own, you know? Just some kind of crazy thoughts just go through your head. Of you know, like, what do you do next? You know, who do you tell? Who do you call for help, you know, really?</br></br>

UCI: And what's going to happen?</br></br>

Caller: But that doesn't even- yeah, exactly you know? Like I said, all they were really giving you was Tylenol, and you just kind of ride it out, you know? I mean, luckily, I wasn't like some other people that needed blood transfusions and all kinds of other crazy stuff. I didn't catch it- I mean I caught it pretty bad, but I managed to work through it, you know?</br></br>

UCI: Shit. You sound like a younger person.</br></br>

Caller: I'm 39, well 40, now. Sorry.</br></br>

UCI: For sure. For sure. Do you think that, how was COVID affecting other people older or younger than you?</br></br>

Caller: Well, actually, my fiancée's actually in the hospital fighting for her life right now as we speak.</br></br>

UCI: Oh, my gosh.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah. They were trying to give her a blood transfusion a couple days ago, and Red Cross denied her. They didn't want to do it. But they're doing some sort of treatment, obviously, and they're doing, I think, six or seven treatments.</br></br>

She's got two more to go. So, and then, from it, she caught pneumonia. So now they're saying she's got lung damage.</br></br>

UCI: Oh, jeez.</br></br>

Caller: And that was another thing in my case too. I was actively doing sports and stuff while I was there, working out and doing all my routines. And, yeah, it took me at least three or four months to recover from my chest just to be able to catch my breath afterwards. Yeah, it was pretty bad.</br></br>

UCI: I'm really sorry, man.</br></br>

Caller: And then it took- yeah, before we even got our shot was another - Jesus, that was March of last year. So, it was almost a whole year went by before we even got our shot.</br></br>

UCI: There's no reason that --</br></br>

Caller: [Unintelligible] went by before we got it. Because I paroled April of this year, and I barely got the shot. So, yeah, it was a long time.</br></br>

UCI: How did the people around you, how were they affected by it? What were they thinking? Because you sound, it sounds like you- were you feeling this way while it was happening? And were you talking to anybody else about it? You said that everyone was too afraid to speak up.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah. Like I said, they were afraid to speak up because they were trying to, basically, isolate you and put you in single cells by yourself. I'm sure it could be viewed as some part of medical treatment, but they weren't really giving you anything, you know?</br></br>

Like I said, it's just Tylenol for your fever. But everybody was just working through it, just living through it, you know?</br></br>

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: And then, finally, basically the whole- there was probably 180 something people in my dorm or in the- I guess there's different dorms or whatnot. But, yeah, I mean, basically, everybody caught it. And then everybody was afraid of just not being able to come back to the same - you know, your same bed with the same people.</br></br>

And that alone, you know, once you establish kind of like a family with the people that are there in your dorm, it's kind of hard to be moved around and just meeting new people. And new problems arise from that. And just, you know?</br></br>

And nobody really wanted to do that. So, that's why people just stayed quiet, because they were just afraid of being relocated.</br></br>

UCI: That's crazy. I mean I'm not sure if that was happening in other places, but just the fact that it was happening at all.</br></br>

Caller: Right. Right, right.</br></br>

UCI: And nobody said anything. Just because, yeah, it's like, if anyone says anything, they know, right, that something's going to happen.</br></br>

Caller: Right, exactly. And then, little by little, like I said, a month later when the nurses started coming in, little by little they started testing afterwards. And the people started testing positive. They started moving us to a whole different building.</br></br>

And after everybody became positive, they separated the people that were negative still with the people that are positive. Then they brought us back to our building. Luckily, we were still with the same people. But, yeah, they brought us back together one at a time.</br></br>

UCI: Jeez.</br></br>

Caller: Which was kind of cool, yeah.</br></br>

UCI: That's crazy.</br></br>

Caller: So, yeah.</br></br>

UCI: For sure, dude. I don't know that's. And then, did you say you've been at [redacted] since when?</br></br>

Caller: Oh.</br></br>

UCI: Since before COVID?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, it was before COVID. Yeah.</br></br>

UCI: Okay. So, you were then when COVID started.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, it was '19. Yeah, I got there in late '19.</br></br>

UCI: Oh, for sure. Oh, okay. So, COVID had already started when you got there.</br></br>

Caller: No.</br></br>

UCI: Or late '18?</br></br>

Caller: Well, it wasn't that facility. It was 2018, and then 2019 is when I got there. So, 2020 passed. So, 2020. Yeah. So, it was 2019 when I caught it there.</br></br>

UCI: Damn.</br></br>

Caller: And that whole prison was doing well until, from what I believe, one of the - from what I had heard, one of the staff members is the one that started bringing it in.</br></br>

And then it was just spread like wildfire after that, you know?</br></br>

UCI: You can't make that up, dude.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah. So, that's exactly what happened. So, yeah, it's a rough ride.</br></br>

UCI: That's, you know, that's - what's it called? I want to let you know that the project has actually gotten that story more than a few times, where we've been finding a direct correlation between the way that the CO's are treating COVID at certain facilities and what happens to the inmates are directly related. So, the fact that your CO's-</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, and it sucks because they weren't mandatory- like, they didn't have to get vaccinated, right? It wasn't mandatory for them to take it.</br></br>

UCI: Crazy.</br></br>

Caller: So, you know, it was like one at a time was coming in sick or whatever. And, yeah, there were a couple of CO's that actually passed away and, obviously-</br></br>

UCI: Oh, my goodness.</br></br>

Caller: -another couple people that passed away [unintelligible], it's all on the website. On their website, it tells you how many people died.</br></br>

UCI: Well, there you go.</br></br>

Caller: And then, that all started from people being transferred from LA county without them being tested. They just started bringing people in, you know? They bring in busloads of people from LA county that are sick, and that's how you start contaminating, you know?</br></br>

UCI: That's right. There was no consideration, it seemed.</br></br>

Caller: No. of course, not. They don't care. They don't care about your wellbeing. They just care about their paycheck. But what are you going to do?</br></br>

UCI: And, you know, maybe your experience, your ability to tell the story, one day will contribute to you know the decline of that system. You never know.</br></br>

Caller: Right. Right. Well, hopefully, it helps in one way or another, you know?</br></br>

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: [Unintelligible]--</br></br>

UCI: Hey, good luck to your, all the best with your fiancée, man. I wish you the best. I hope that she'll have a speedy recovery.</br></br>

Caller: Thank you. Thank you.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah. And if there's anything else you want to ever - if there's another material you want to tell me right now, you can. And then, what's it called, if you want to call back and tell some more stuff about COVID and your experience, it's the same number. And if you call any time 5:00 to 9:00, what's it called 5:00 to 9:00 pm on Monday through Friday, we'll be here.</br></br>

Caller: All right. I think the worst thing right now - not necessarily. Like, I don't have it. It's just like, being in here, what do you do? I'm feeling helpless for my fiancée. I'm on the receiving end now, right? Just feeling helpless.</br></br>

I'm not being able to help her or do anything with her, be by her side to fight through this, you know? And, like I said, she's one of the–</br></br>

UCI: So, that's something else. Not only did you have an unfair chance with dealing with your COVID, but now you can't even help your fiancée have her fair chance.</br></br>

Caller: Right, exactly. And that's- that's the thing for one person to deal with it by yourself is one thing, but just seeing a family member that you can't even be there for them to help them, I think this has been probably harder than just dealing with it, you know?</br></br>

Like I told her, "I wish I take your pain. I wish I could carry it for you." It would be easier for me to deal with it than to sit here and be texting back and forth or the phone calls.</br></br>

Just the way she's feeling and the drugs they're giving her to fight through it and all that stuff, you know, you feel so vulnerable at that point. There's nothing you can do.</br></br>

There's nothing. What do you say? What do you do? You don't sleep at night. The other day, I just felt nauseous. Yeah, it was pretty bad.</br></br>

UCI: I'm sorry, man, Thanks for sharing that. Thanks for telling me that.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah. Yeah. So, I think this part is worse than --</br></br>

UCI: Is there anything you've been doing to cope with that? Have you been able to have any outlets at the facility?</br></br>

Caller: Well, there's a difference between prison and this place. You don't have too many outlets here. I try to communicate with her and talk to her and make sure she's doing better or whatnot, but we don't have the yard. We don't have the facilities. They don't let us, you know –</br></br>

UCI: Oh. What is [redacted]?</br></br>

Caller: [redacted] is a state prison, but I'm not at [redacted] right now.</br></br>

UCI: Oh, okay. Where are you at currently?</br></br>

Caller: Right now I'm at [redacted] in - it would be, I guess, the [redacted]. It's an ICE facility.</br></br>

UCI: Got it.</br></br>

Caller: Like an immigration ICE facility.</br></br>

UCI: Got it.</br></br>

Caller: So, at this place, I mean they only give you so many hours of yard. I mean it's not like in prison. Prison, you could walk in and out, and it's more livable. A prison's more livable than this place. There aren't too many outlets besides really talking to people or watching TV. You're trapped in your own mind sometimes, you know?</br></br>

That's what you do. There's really nothing to do here. They tell you to go talk to a staff member or schedule an appointment with, like, a shrink or whatnot. But it's - I don't know. It's just scary even talking to people about it, you know?</br></br>

UCI: Well, what's wrong with the shrinks?</br></br>

Caller: I don't know. A lot of the people here, like you say, it just - I don't know. I just never really considered sitting there and talking to somebody about it like I'm actually doing right now. I've never really considered doing anything like this.</br></br>

UCI: I'll be honest. I'll be honest. I'm a similar way. Before I had just got onto it, I had never considered therapy like that. I'm just asking because I'm curious about how the facilities are over there, you know? Is it just that you've avoided them, or are they bad? That's what I'm curious.</br></br>

Caller: You hear stories. Of course, you hear stories from the other inmates or whatnot, just like here, that just, they seem like they're crazier than we are, you know?</br></br>

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: So, it's like, how do you talk to somebody that's crazier than you? And a lot of the times, like when you're having your own personal issues, you're afraid that they're going to use that against you in any way, you know?</br></br>

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: Like here, if you tell them that you're going through some stressful situation or you're having suicidal thoughts for whatever reason or whatever the case may be, they'll use that against you. And they won't want to let you go because now you're some sort of, like, you could harm people out there, you know?</br></br>

UCI: Well, what's wrong with going in there and maybe being honest about that and being up front that that's how you feel, and maybe go from there?</br></br>

Caller: Right. You know, [unintelligible] that, but --</br></br>

UCI: I'm just playing Devil's advocate.</br></br>

Caller: Right. All right. But, you know, people are not going to take that chance of talking to them.</br></br>

UCI: True. Most won't. You're right. Most won't.</br></br>

Caller: They can fill out a paper, and they're going to use it. They show that to the judge, saying, "Hey, this guy's-"</br></br>

UCI: Yet again, you need the warden and the prison staff to help to facilitate the culture to - you know?</br></br>

Caller: It's different until you're at home, right? You're at home, and you go. You pay a shrink to go talk to them, whatever. It doesn't go past that. They can't use it against you, right? They're not going to share it with anybody else.</br></br>

UCI: Right.</br></br>

Caller: Right? Here, they could use it against you in so many different ways, you know?</br></br>

UCI: Absolutely.</br></br>

Caller: So, people just don't trust them, don't want to talk to them. So, we kind of stick to ourselves and stick to the people that we're here and the people that we trust here and go from there. And we talk amongst each other, you know?</br></br>

So, yeah, man. That's the hardest part: just seeing a loved one - you know, just seeing a loved one go through it.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah. Hey, dude, well, I think that we have to probably cut the call now just because I've got to keep the line free for other callers. But, hey, dude, that was so much great information. And I'm so happy that we were able to just talk and hang out.</br></br>

And I'm really thankful that you also were able to share with me and I was able to hear some stuff that you're going through, man. I honestly wish you all the best and your fiancée all the best.</br></br>

That's not cool, what you went through with COVID, you know? And that's the reason that we're doing this project. Because we want people to know what's going on with you. I want people to know what your experience was, and I'm happy that we were able to talk today.</br></br>

I won't say your name, but I know it and I'll probably remember it. So, if I ever talk to you again, dude, it's nice catching you.</br></br>

Everyone else that runs the hotline is super cool too. So, if you ever want to call back and there's some more stuff that you want to tell about your story, just feel free, dude, 5:00 to 9:00 p.m. Monday through Friday. And let everybody else at [redacted] know that, hey, UCI PrisonPandemic has a hotline.</br></br>

They want people to call and just tell their story. Because we want your homies to call and tell their stories too, because the more stories, the better. If everyone at [redacted] called and told the same story, bro how does that sound, right?</br></br>

Caller: Mm-hmm.</br></br>

UCI: But anyways, good luck with everything. Is there anything else that you wanted the public to know or anything like that?</br></br>

Caller: No. I think that just about sums it up now.</br></br>

UCI: For sure, man. Hey, have a great day. Thanks so much for participating in PrisonPandemic.</br></br>

Caller: Thank you very much.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah. Have a great one, okay? Goodbye.</br></br>
