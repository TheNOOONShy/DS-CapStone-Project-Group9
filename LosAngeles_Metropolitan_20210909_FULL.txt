Hi,</br></br>

Sorry this took awhile, I’ve been trying to think of a way to answer your questions. But I can’t get past the fact that you could be an AI. If you can prove you are human and not an AI, that would help me and then I can help you. Please understand I’ve been used and hurt, I need proof. I’m very cautious. One way you can prove you’re human, is send me a picture of you or a picture of an animal, cat, if possible. Of yourself will be best.</br></br>

Thanks.
