This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Theo Lacy. </br></br>They have been cruel to us and “negligence”. They do to the minimum only and classification cells you up with good people or a really bad person, and they don’t care and tell us to fight each other or to get along. I want to advance my careers and benefit in education and financially.</br></br>The first thing that happened which I feel really drew me close to the Lord was prayers from my folks and from my friends who do know Christ. They have been behind me ever since I got into this trouble. They never have left me and they’ve always been right by my side, praying for me.</br></br>After what I’ve been through and the things I’ve been associated with, that I could come back into a good life, a happy life, where I’d be loved, where other folks could love you, and where there would be people in the free world who cared about me and prayed for me and looked for the day when I’d be restored to freedom so I can life a good American worthwhile life.</br></br> So for the longest time since we went on lockdown quarantine, we’ve been eating poorly, like meat sandwiches three times a day for just about the whole pandemic.</br></br>Now last June and July, the whole jail of homies and woods and others went on a hunger strike for about six days. That was my first hunger strike and I received two major disciplinary write ups for the first time.</br></br>So there’s always count time and medication call couple times a day. In the jail, we are always cleaning minimum once or more a day every in the morning. In this Nr mod, we went on lockdown quarantine on December 10th and we were only allowed 30 minute day room for phone or showers and that lasted a couple of months.</br></br>Now I can’t explain too much or any part of my case but you can look me up my news or paper articles as much as possible. I’m being charged with an axe slaying of my stepmom.</br></br>I want to do anything and everything possible for myself that produces fruitful characteristics. Now I’ll be 29 in August. And single, no kids, and am like the greatest gentlemen ever.</br></br>So when they test us, they check our temperature, ask us if we have any symptoms and nose swab. They continued doing these tests everyday around eight or so in the morning.</br></br>Now jail has been more violent than even the outside world. Our well-being is the least issue the cops worrisome. I’ve been through some of the most violent cases than I’ve ever experienced inside.</br></br>I’ve been through and seen over 40 inmates commit suicidal tendencies my first 40 months in jail. Some successfully kill themselves and most are saved. Drugs are real.
