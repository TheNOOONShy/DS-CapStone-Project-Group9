This story was told by a person incarcerated at Solano.</br></br>

UCI: Man, I mean, I can’t even imagine, you know, not being able to get any sort of help. And I’m happy that you’re, you know, starting your process of being vaccinated.</br></br>

Caller: Yes.</br></br>

UCI: Are you finding that other individuals are also getting vaccinated? Or is there, are they still kind of limited on who can get vaccinated by how many doses are available to everyone?</br></br>

Caller: Well, they’re offering it to everybody but not everybody’s are, not everybody are accepting.</br></br>

UCI: Okay.</br></br> 

Caller: Because they don’t trust the, the vaccine itself.</br></br>

UCI: Right, so there’s no, I guess, there’s no age limit, right, where you have to be this age and up or have underlying health conditions? There’s nothing like that with your vaccination process; it’s just, whoever wants one, one is available.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah. Yeah. Well, they, they come to the buildings and ask anybody. They call people up and say, “Do you want to take the vaccine?” They’ll say “yes” or “no” and, and they did that three times. So, they get their vaccines; they going down the line. They projected that everybody in this institution would get their vaccines by the end of September.
