Hello UCI Student,</br></br>

I’m getting back at you all on this little letter that you sent to me. So I’m going to answer and tell you all what’s really going on behind those walls where I’m at 'cause all types of bullshit going down. But let me first start off with what you’re asking me on this paper alright.</br></br> 

Well since I got the COVID-19 and got over the COVID-19 my life been well. But at the same time I’m not trying to get that shit again cause that ain't no joke at all. Especially being in prison or jail 'cause these correctional officers really don’t five two fucks about us. Like, real shit so don’t never think they do cause they don’t alright. And that’s coming from someone that’s been doing this since I’ve been 33 and I say 33 'cause that’s how old I will be when I’m done doing this time and I been in since I was 18.</br></br>
 
But yeah like I was saying none of these correctional officers don’t care about none of us in blues? But it’s ok cause green workers can fuck their self 'cause as soon they do something they will never know how it really feels to be blues. But until then they will never know how it feels to be in jail or prison?</br></br> 

And that’s real talk and life. And I also wanted to ask you all do you have a penpal set? Since you guys take poems and drawings, and etc.? Please let me know and also can we call you from jail or prison? Let me know on that please. Thanks well until I hear from you all again I’ll be waiting ok.
