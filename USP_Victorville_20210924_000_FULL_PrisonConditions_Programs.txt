This letter was written by a person incarcerated at USP Victorville.</br></br>

I am writing you this letter - story in regards to your letter asking me to formulate something for the PrisonPandemic project. My first thought about this letter is that the pandemic crisis that hits the prisons have started last February when I was at USP Florence in Florence, Colorado. There have been difficult changes that have been made at these institutions like modifying movement where units are not interacting, except the fact that one must have a cellmate even if the cellmate is infected by the virus. It's not going to change anything.</br></br>

Lately, there’s been the First Step Act of December 2018 that have been somewhat helping inmates - prisoners to get out of prison by filing a 18 USC §3582 (C)(I)(A) for Compassionate Release and the First Step Act for Section 404 (a), (b), or (c), also extraordinary and compelling reasons. The part about Compassionate Release consists of illnesses, old age, and COVID-19. The FBOP is a business that is also governed by the DOJ which creates the confusion of holding back inmates who deserve a chance to be back in society and to live a law abiding lifestyle as a citizen.</br></br>

At this moment, the prison business is what it is, and the truth about the big business is that it is so corrupt and filled overt acts also good at covering up their bad deeds due to the lack of scrutiny, investigation, and proper case filing based on the abuse and ill treatment inmates have been facing. Prison systems are the new mental and physical asylum; however, the psychologists and psychiatrists would not give out any recommendation letters towards an inmate's relief from prison whether they complete the Cognitive Behavioral Skills course or the intense Drug & Alcohol programs.</br></br>

The prison system have been slowly changing, and there have been worse times in the past. But today’s fight is with the way how the institutions are depriving inmates from getting out when they’re at risk with catching COVID. So even if the warden denies their BP-9 filings for home confinement or halfway house, the courts will do the same. There are problems with the law and the manipulated scheme & using the District Courts to avoid the proper usage of §3553(a) sentence factor.</br></br>

Also missing the sentence guidelines with illegal mandatory minimums, enhancement based on prior convictions and the said prior convictions doesn't have anything to do with a crime of violence or serious criminal activities. I don't know if your studies have anything to do with Political Science or Social Science, however, if you are partaking in law, your time should not be wasted on the injustice of America’s prisons. It's more about the egalitarian new growth of wealth away from the oligarchy and the people of economical wealth, financial criminals, and shelters.</br></br>

My story has no significant aim at anyone particular, this is more about the ill treatment of these prisons, from the preparation of meals to the malpractice of medical. The prisons have been abusive as a design for anyone’s psyche whether you're endured time given. Thank you for taking your time to reach out to me, and that says a lot about people in society. I pray that your days are blessed, also thank you for your patience in reading my letter - story.</br></br>

Sincerely.
