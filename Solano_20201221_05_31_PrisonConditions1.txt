This story was told by a person incarcerated at Solano.</br></br>

Caller: Well, first off, I guess I can say that it’s been like utter, complete, chaos. So, at first, they mandated masks, but, you know, one of the biggest problems is that there is a lack of, I guess, boundaries here and a lack of enforcement of rules and regulations.</br></br> 

So, specifically, the masks. So, we were mandated to wear masks. Yet there were many officers who refused to force compliance with masks, so you had inmates running around in the day room, with no masks. You had officers running around with no masks, and low and behold, we’ve had several breakouts. And a big part of that was the failure to force compliance with the masks.</br></br>  So, fast forward, now we’re at the, I believe it’s like 261 is our number now, and it’s still occurring where masks are not being enforced. We were placed in the gym.
