This story was told by a person incarcerated at Tulare County Jail.</br></br>

UCI: So how is the COVID situation like at your facility, how is it like?</br></br>

Caller: Oh man, I mean the - the experience I had was just something else man. I know it's the holidays and - especially for me, you know what I mean. You know with everything going on and it was just crazy but, during - during the time I had gotten a letter cause I went to [redacted] State.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: And I studied sociology.</br></br>

UCI: Gotcha.</br></br>

Caller: So it was just crazy man. You know everything I learned from school and then going into there, I was like I - I - you guys have an online.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: Service or whatever but of course I didn’t have - when I was in jail, of course I didn’t have access to you know, getting in contact with you guys that way. I had to wait ‘til I got out. But I did get a letter, I was like "what?" I got a letter from someone from.</br></br>

UCI: UCI.</br></br>

Caller: Irvine.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, UCI.</br></br>

Caller: Oh ok. Yeah I was like, "What?", but yeah. Just crazy man, so, I mean the COVID, I haven’t had the COVID.</br></br>

UCI; Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: I haven’t gotten the COVID. But, so yeah, that’s why I was just like, "What? What’s going on?" And I meant to respond but being, being in jail is just, it’s just - it's just crazy. It's crazy. So I was just like "Oh someone you know, someone to talk to."</br></br>

UCI: Yeah it’s - yeah this is a better line of contact if you wanted to be able to share your COVID story, because you can get one on one interaction with one of the students who are actually on this project, like myself. So, describe the situation, you said it was crazy, what do you mean by it’s crazy, like describe it. Because I’m assuming it spread rapidly as I’ve seen well beyond this project, so how is it spreading?</br></br>

Caller: Well I didn’t see a lot of people - or I didn’t see anybody who had COVID.</br></br>

UCI: Gotcha. Not many people had COVID in your facility?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, no.</br></br>

UCI: Interesting.</br></br>

Caller: Well you get tested. You gotta get tested in there, I don't know if you’re aware.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah. So, I don’t want to say that’s an anomaly because everyone who’s told me has said that it was a rather fast spreading situation, so what measures did they take to make sure that it wasn’t an extremely volatile situation? What precautions would you say that other facilities need to take to have similar success as yours?</br></br>

Caller: Well, from what you first said, the tests. So yeah, so the tests, the COVID testing, I mean that I’m pretty sure helps. They test you, when I was in pre-trial the quarantine unit.</br></br>

UCI: Gotcha.</br></br>

Caller: I don’t know if anyone told you that. I know this is your guys’ hotline.</br></br>

UCI: So you would say the testing. The -</br></br>

Caller: Yeah the testing, like the precautions, you know, giving people COVID tests. So yeah.</br></br>

UCI: Would you say the vaccine situation helped in your facility?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah I’m sure, I’m sure it helped. I didn’t get vaccinated but.</br></br>

UCI: Gotcha. How was that vaccine situation in your facility? If you are aware. Like describe it to me.</br></br>

Caller: The vaccine situation so, the workers, they would give you a walk around and give you information and like the medical staff.</br></br>

UCI: Gotcha. So this is like an intense situation, so how have you been coping with this situation?</br></br>

Caller: Just, well I mean I got out - I got out so I guess, you know, spending time with family, the holidays. I had to spend Thanksgiving in there so I mean that was rough, but -.</br></br>

UCI: Well that sounds like you’ve been coping relatively well.</br></br>

Caller: I also like exercising.</br></br>

UCI: Gotcha. So you said you had family that you spent time with and that was a big part of your coping process. I would like to let you know this hotline is available to them, so if they want to share their experience with having a loved one incarcerated during the COVID-19 pandemic, this hotline is available to them. So, we are more than willing to take their calls if they are willing to call us.</br></br>

Caller: Okay, how do you mean by that?</br></br>

UCI: If you give them this phone number, and they want to call, we will answer the phone.</br></br>

Caller: Who?</br></br>

UCI: Your loved ones.</br></br>

Caller: Oh really?</br></br>

UCI: Yes, it is available to them as well. So if they want to share how they felt during having a loved one incarcerated during the COVID-19 pandemic, this is also available to them.</br></br>

Caller: Okay. So yeah that’s why it was perfect for me cause everything I was going through.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: So yeah that’s good information.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah. Is there anything else you’d like to share regarding your COVID-19 experience while being incarcerated?</br></br>

Caller: Man, I have a lot.</br></br>

UCI: Keep sharing, keep sharing.</br></br>

Caller: I’m sorry. I’m sorry, you’re probably busy.</br></br>

UCI: No, keep sharing what you want to share. Keep sharing what you want to share.</br></br>

Caller: So yeah, I know it's like rough for everyone that's why I try to tell people. I’m like, "Man what’s going on?" And I know it’s just a rough time, you know, for everybody.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: Everybody, you know, I don’t know what’s going on and it’s just - I mean for me it felt good to be back home.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: But I hear people write, you know of course, you know my loved one’s, family friends. You know they wanna know like "Oh my god, how was it?" or "What?"</br></br> 

You know they’re hearing everything, you know, oh there’s a big issue with the COVID. And I’m like, well I didn’t get it. You know what I mean, I haven’t gotten sick.</br></br>

UCI: Good. So you said the vaccine process helped. You said you got a lot to share, so share what you want to share.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah I’m on low battery, I can probably go get my charger.</br></br>

UCI: If you want to - if you’d like to call back that's also a possibility, because I know you probably have a lot to share. You can go get your charger.</br></br> 

Caller: Yeah okay. Well I mean shoot, oh yeah so your guys’ hotline right.</br></br>

UCI: Yes. Yes you have until -</br></br>

Caller: [Unintelligible] family.</br></br> 

Caller: But, we also like to don’t forget other people’s things so preferably we like to limit our calls to about 15 minutes. 15 to 20 minutes.</br></br>

Caller: Okay, okay. I know you guys said you can’t share your name, but when I was on, online, I put my name on the -</br></br>

UCI: The website.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah. Yes the website, where you are able to share your experience.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: And I know that that letter I got when I was - I got a letter when I was in [redacted].</br></br>

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: I don’t know if you’re familiar with that. Well it’s in Tulare county, it’s just a city in Tulare county.</br></br>

UCI: Okay.</br></br>

Caller: So yeah I got the letter and the letter, the response it said, [redacted] Turner, I believe it said.</br></br>

UCI: [Redacted] Turner, yes she’s one of the professors.</br></br>

Caller: Professors.</br></br>

UCI: On the project, yes.</br></br>

Caller: Oh okay, okay. So yeah I had gotten that on there and I meant to you know, call. To give them a call, but when you’re incarcerated and you know, it’s not like I just have access to a phone.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: And so, I just knew like, "Okay everything will be okay, I’ll get out and call the hotline."</br></br>

UCI: Yeah. Did you experience any like reduced visitation or programming while you were at - while you were incarcerated during the COVID-19 pandemic?</br></br>

Caller: Well, absolutely. I mean, like I just told you, I couldn't just, you know, I didn’t have access to a phone. I mean they have phones in there, but you never know when they’re gonna let you out or, you know, what they’re gonna do.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah. Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, it's like I said - awh shoot, what was I going to say, I forgot.</br></br>

UCI: It’s okay we all forget sometimes what we’re going to say.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah.</br></br>

UCI: So let me try to jog your memory, we were talking about the reduced visitations and programming, how you didn’t have access to a phone.</br></br>

Caller: Oh okay, well I’m out now but.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, but while you were incarcerated, how you didn’t have access to a phone. I’m assuming that also had a toll on your loved ones, how did they respond with you being incarcerated during COVID?</br></br>

Caller: They would just, you know, when they get the chance to call me, just like when I had the chance, I would, you know, try to call them.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: And so that’s why, you know, that's why it was tough for me to, you know, just get that - get that number and, you know, and then just call.</br></br>

UCI: Of course.</br></br>

Caller: Right, of course. They, you know, they change - they change, you're in one cell and then they take you to another cell or different unit, different detention facility.</br></br>

UCI: Of course. What else do you want people to know about your experience regarding COVID-19 while being incarcerated?</br></br>

Caller: Shoot, just be careful with everything. Man it’s just crazy. It was sad, I was sad. I have kids of my own, I have a wife. You know we’re just going through some turmoil right now.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: That's why I was incarcerated.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: But it was just rough on me, it was just rough on me.</br></br>

UCI: How was it like, how was it rough? You can share as much or as little as you’d like.</br></br>

Caller: Just missing my family. Missing my family and friends.</br></br>

UCI: You’ve discussed your family and friends a few times throughout this call, and I want to once again remind you that if they want to call to express how they felt during, having you incarcerated during COVID, this hotline is available to them. So just share their phone number. 

They do have to be above 18 years old, so I know you said you had kids, I don’t know how old they are.</br></br>

Caller: They’re babies.</br></br>

UCI: If they’re not of age, they really can’t call, but your wife is more than willing, if she would like to call, she is more than willing to call as well.</br></br>

Caller: That’s good news. I’d just like to say thank you.</br></br>

UCI: Oh no, thank you for sharing your story. Do you have anything else to share before we have to get off?</br></br>

Caller: Well, I guess I can always just call you guys back on this number.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah. If you want you can also -  some people have said they wanted to send a letter to make sure we’re real, and then formulate their thoughts and send us a letter. That is also a possibility. Do you have the mailing address? Would you like the mailing address? If you prefer to send a letter.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah. Yeah that would be awesome.</br></br>

UCI: Alright let me get the mailing address right now, let me pull it up right now for you. Give me one minute, I just have to go to this right here.</br></br>

Caller: Oh I thought you asked me for my mailing address.</br></br>

UCI: Oh no, I’m saying do you have the mailing address to send us a sub because some people prefer to send us a letter instead.</br></br>

Caller: Oh yeah that’s fine. Yeah I already got a letter from you guys.</br></br>

UCI: Alright, so you have the mailing address, the PrisonPandemic project for 45241 Campus Drive number 438, Irvine California 92612?</br></br>

Caller: Yes so that sounds about right.</br></br>

UCI: Awesome.</br></br>

Caller: I wasn’t able to - I’m sorry.</br></br>

UCI: No, no you’re good. We’re just talking and I keep talking over you but continue.</br></br>

Caller: Oh no, I was just gonna tell you that I had got a letter in there, but like I said I lost it. Because right away they changed me to a different cell and I lost it.</br></br> 

I lost it just like I lost my court paperwork that was really important to me and I tried to tell everybody, "Hey you know, can you bring me my court paperwork? It was in the cell I was just in." And they refused.</br></br>

UCI: Oh. That’s unfortunate. So, but you have our mailing address correct?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah I can go online.</br></br>

UCI: Awesome. Well if you don’t have anything else to share, I’d like to thank you for calling the PrisonPandemic for sharing your story. I know you said you have more to share, but you’re more than willing to call us at a later time when you have ideas of what you want to share some more. But thanks for calling us.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah. Thank you.</br></br>

UCI: Alright, have a great day - have a great night.</br></br>

Caller: Thank you. Thank you, you too.</br></br>

UCI: Bye.</br></br>

Caller: Bye.</br></br>
