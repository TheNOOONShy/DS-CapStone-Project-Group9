Dear staff,</br></br>

I’m at the CDCR facility in Chino, level two, senior yard, and I understand you are interested in first-hand data during the C-virus modification of programs. I am 67, Air Force veteran in very good health since this started last year. </br></br>

We live in long four upper/lower beds three to five feet apart on the sides. The outer rows of 10 to 12 beds have screened windows that open to the outside. Shortly after the pandemic, orders were sent down to take every third bed out of service, the logic of which doesn’t play out due to our proximity standing in lines for chow, utilizing the restroom/showers located midway between the 50 bed groups. </br></br>

If you Google Earth 14901 S. Central Ave, Chino, our eight dorm layout can be seen with a 'tent city’ of 12 eight-man tents in the center with portable AC/heating units, shower trailers and restrooms for those who tested positive in the last nine months, but mostly not showing any symptoms.
