Well first of all thank you and UCI for sending me this letter. And inside VSP the pandemic is getting better all of the time, have to keep positive. And it really is looking good. Everyone is keeping to themselves and I’m in a great pod.</br></br> 

We all joke, read, draw, and talk to each other respectfully. The visiting is hard but I’m getting out soon, going to transition home in Los Angeles close to my family and friends.</br></br>

I’ve always been dealing with the crisis. Okay, it’s the heat I can’t stand because of my seizures, don’t go out much. Oh, the vaccinations have been doing great, everyone is taking them that I know. That’s a good thing, we all want to get home and do what we have to do.</br></br>

When I get out, transition home first, parole, doctor, medication, sign up for food stamps, Medical. I believe I can do anything I put my mind to. God bless you, I hope I could write to you when I get out. Thank you!</br></br>

I’m in great health, I hope you are too and all at UCI, thanks for being a friend. I wish you all the best in the future. I really was surprised when I got your letter, so I’m writing to you. Hope and pray for you and friends.</br></br> 

We’re supposed to be getting tablets, so we could get in touch with family and friends soon. I probably will be out by then, I hope. See ya soon tablet!</br></br>

God bless you, keep writing if possible, thanks!
