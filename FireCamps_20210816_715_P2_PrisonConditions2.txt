This story was told by a person incarcerated at Fire Camp.</br></br> 

Caller: Especially when, in my opinion, which is based on firsthand experience, they do not follow any proper contamination protocols. And the Director of Health at Sierra Conservation Center in Jamestown, California, was specifically notified by myself that we had made physical contact in the public in two specific locations.</br></br>

She refused to notify CDC or the local health officials to launch the track and trace program to notify these individuals that they may have come into contact with COVID-positive people so that they could have the option of say, I don't know, boosting their immune system through vitamins.</br></br>

Dr. [redacted] of the Sierra Conservation Center, who was given the exact information of where we stopped, what time we stopped, how long we were there for. The scenario was described to her in detail from a 602 that I wrote and a 22 form that I submitted and a letter that I wrote describing the women and children that were out in the present, in line, waiting for us to finish using the water fountain as we were exposed to a gentleman who had had direct COVID exposure, that was put in the transpac van with us.</br></br>

UCI: Where's the accountability?</br></br>

Caller: Now, is that a rhetorical question?</br></br>

UCI: Yes.</br></br>

Caller: Because I don't have an answer.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, exactly.</br></br>

Caller: The accountability lies, hopefully in my end because I've reached out to my people and told them to reach out to the local health officials to let them know that they need to do something about this because the doctor at Sierra Conservation Center has refused to do anything, and so has any and all personnel that I personally reached out to at the Sierra Conservation Center.
