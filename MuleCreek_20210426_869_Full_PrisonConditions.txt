This letter was written by an individual incarcerate at Mule Creek.</br></br>I received the message you set to me on 4/23/21 inquiring about stories of incarcerated people during the pandemic. I have a couple interesting stories. I, myself have been impacted a lot by COVID-19. It was scary when the stories started coming out about this new virus. In the beginning of 2020, I was working as a coffee roaster in the coffee roasting and packaging facility here at Mule Creek.</br></br>I was looking forward to finishing my coffee training and earning my certifications when the pandemic hit, and everything was shut down. I was told that my coffee training would be put on hold. I was supposed to start working for a private roasting com-any starting in July of 2020, but it got put on hold due to the pandemic. I was supposed to be making minimum wage and paving a way for transitioning to working for this private company when I parole.</br></br>I am a youth offender and have been in prison since 23 days after my 18th birthday so I was hoping to build my future on this coffee education. I was the only coffee roaster for this prison from July 2018 – December 2020, roasting over one million pounds of coffee for every prison, state hospital, Caltrans, CHP and any other state agency that buys coffee from this (PA) at Mule Creek. It is frustrating to think you have accomplished something but getting nowhere and being a slave to the system where my value as a human is considered less than because I did something wrong as a youth.</br></br>I worked overtime on several occasions only to have my supervisor try to abuse the process by not paying what is right. My little sister was shot and killed during the pandemic, so I was going to use some of the money I was hoping to get for working for that private company to help support my niece and nephew, but it still never happened, and I don’t know if it will. My nephew started having emotion problems and ended up in juvenile hall and I don’t know what happened to my niece.</br></br>She stopped taking my phone calls a few months ago after my friend gave my niece some money to buy a quarterly package for me. My niece and I were barely starting to get to know each other due to a rift that occurred between my sister and I when my mom died in 2015. My sister was upset because I talk to my uncles and aunts. My uncle came from Wisconsin to handle the cremation and he doesn’t have contact with my sister due to her lifestyle and negative behavior.</br></br>My uncle spread my mom’s ashes without letting my sisters participate, so my sister cussed me out and didn’t talk to me until later in 2019 but then she was shot in June 2020. I lost my sister, niece and nephew but did gain the support of my aunt and got back in contact with my friend from childhood. I have also continued to work toward my rehabilitation by completing several self-help classes through correspondence with mental health here at MCSP.</br></br>I am currently in the process of preparing my paperwork and getting support letters ready for a request for commutation, so I have been trying to reach out to as many people as possible to help gain support for parole. I am 42 years old now and was denied seven years at my first youth offender parole board hearing in 2017, so I have been doing everything I can to prepare myself to be successful upon parole. During my trail in 1998 there were a couple of neuropsychologists who testified on my behalf concerning organize brain disorder, ADHD, and other aspects of human development that contributed to how I was back then (1996). Since that time, I have done a lot of changing.</br></br>I wrote a letter to one of the doctors who was head of neuropsychology at UCLA, and he agreed to come see me in order to possibly endorse a letter in support of parole for me. I had and have to push all of the fears and uncertainly of the pandemic aside to find a way to make it home. My childhood friend wants to partner with me to start a coffee shop when I get out and he is willing to finance the entire operation, so I have been trying to get him to have as much as he can get in the form of coffee education.</br></br>Wearing masks, staying clean while the whole building was getting sick all around me. My neighbors on both sides, me and my roommate were both vaccinated with the Pfizer two dose shots in February, and it seemed to go pretty smooth. I was surprised the state offered us the vaccine. I thought for sure they wanted to let us die. When the pandemic first started, the medical staff had all the breathing machine confiscated from people who were described machines for apnea.</br></br>I don’t know how long they kept them for, but it was disturbing to see. People were being moved out of their housing units and sent to the gym if they tested positive and then sent back and allowed to help pass put our food after a few days. We were being limited on how much food we could buy from the store, so there was a lot of anxiety about that and having no visits really leaves me feeling vulnerable to the mercy of the people who keep us in prison, getting on the phone was suddenly super important.</br></br>Three showers during the week are what we were reduced to. At a time when you would have assumed more showers would be encouraged, the prison system only knows how to revert to what it knows best, locked doors. We were not given any cleaning supplies, only the porters were given bleach to clean with and that was a rare cleaning agenda. When certain buildings were on quarantine, I would have to do the work of four to five people. It was chaotic at times and had to do a lot to help my supervisor keep machines going to package coffee at work.</br></br>With all of the prisons cell feeding, there was a huge demand for the 1.5-gram instant coffee packs that we also produce in our coffee shop. So, there were days when we would work nine and a half hours and 12 hours, 6 days a week to try to make sure that the prisoners had coffee on their breakfast trays. I had a lot of worry about it, but I am used to living a life full of anxiety and fear, so it was a bumpier road, but nothing that I could not handle.</br></br>The stimulus payment helped when I got $1,200 from the IRS. That was like a dream that I didn’t believe until I got my order from the store. It was disheartening when the IRS tried to dispute whether or not they wanted prisoners to get CARES Act funds. It was encouraging when a law firm filed on behalf of prisoners to receive the money. I still have not received my second round or third round payments but hope to get them soon. Safety is something that is hard to feel in a place like this, especially with things like viruses and violence going on.</br></br>We have to worry about who we live with, who may be forced to live with, where we may be housed (what prison), if they are going to let sick people come here. If I am going to have a job, money, family, etc. In 2021 SB132 passed into being a law, so now transgender, non-binary people can ask to be housed at women’s prisons. It’s been a roller coaster of injustice and moving toward justice, we can see that the country wants to breathe but the knees on our necks are not willing to let up voluntarily.</br></br>Well, I hope I have answered the questions you had. If you have any more feel free to ask. There are more. I have a pet gopher that has helped a lot and a roommate of almost nine years, like family. The gopher is so funny. If I could record him, he would make America laugh so hard. Take care.</br></br>
