This story was told by a family member of someone incarcerated at Tulare Bob Wiley Detention Center.</br></br>UCI: Okay. And did you have anything specific you wanted to share? Or would you like me to go down the list of questions?</br></br>Caller: I guess we'll go down the list of questions and see if I can answer them myself.</br></br>UCI: Okay.</br></br>Caller: And then I'll tell you some things I guess if we don't cover them.</br></br>UCI: Okay. Sounds good. Well, the first one, what has the COVID situation been like for them?</br></br>Caler: Well, so about a week or two ago? Well, maybe a little longer than that. Maybe about three weeks ago, all together, they were quarantining inmates incorrectly. And so, people kept getting sick, so I don't know, exactly./br></br> 

So, instead of taking them from one unit and moving them to a separate quarantining unit, I know for a while they're using the pretrial facility next door to quarantine new inmates. And that seemed to be working okay, I think but I don't know if they changed their procedures or what, but people started to get sick. And -</br></br>UCI: I can't hear you on my end anymore. I'm not too sure if the line cut off. But if you can hear me please call me back so you can continue sharing. Thank you.</br></br>UCI: Hello?</br></br> Caller: Hi, I was just speaking with someone and our line, they couldn’t hear me anymore.</br></br>UCI: Oh, yeah. That was me. Oh, you were able to hear me. That’s awesome. Okay.</br></br>Caller: Okay. Yes. Okay. So where, where did you last hear me?</br></br>UCI: The last time where I could hear you was you were telling us about how they were using the other facility to - yeah, the other facility.</br></br>Caller: For quarantine of new inmates. Yes. And so, I don't know, if they stopped doing that, or what the people started to get sick in my sister's facility. And she felt like they weren't quarantining them properly. And they were sort of using the fact that people got sick as a way to lessen their programs.</br></br> 

So instead of being an hour, I guess they were 30 minutes. And so that was a big issue for my sister. You know, and then, I guess, like that not all the deputies wear masks.</br></br>Are you still there?</br></br>UCI: Oh, yes, I can still hear you.</br></br>Caller: Okay, and then, so, when my sister wanted to get vaccinated before, they put her on a waiting list, instead of just getting her, her vaccine when they got her call slip, and said that at least 10 people had to sign up for the vaccination, before they would vaccinate her. I don't know if that's normal protocol.</br></br> 

I just feel like if you're trying to, you know, prevent the spread and a jail or anything like that you would want to, you know, get to that as soon as possible. So, it took like, a month, I think, for them to even, you know, vaccinate her the first time. And, yeah.</br></br>UCI: That's definitely a long time to wait from, from requesting it to actually getting it.</br></br>Caller: Yeah.</br></br>UCI: How has their situation affected you and your family?</br></br>
Caller: Well, they stopped doing visits pretty close to the beginning of the virus, you know, like, when they started doing shut downs. Like, from then on, we weren't having visits even when places started to open. And I feel like it's ridiculous because the stools are six feet apart anyway.</br></br> 

And you know, they're behind the screen. So, you know, if we wore masks and everything, I don't see why we wouldn't be able to have in person visits. I think they're just really taking advantage of the situation.</br></br>And so now, if we want to have visits we have to use IC solutions. And before it was GTL. So, the visits were 15 dollars for 30 minutes. Now they're much less.</br></br>UCI: And these are in person visits that you're talking about?</br></br>Caller: Yeah, I mean, yeah. So, we haven't had in person visits for years. Since the virus started. We've had to pay for them, for video visits.</br></br>UCI: Okay. How have you been coping with everything?</br></br>Caller: It's been difficult. You know, I really missed seeing my sister. You know, my brother in law, he's incarcerated at [redacted]. And it's really difficult to afford all these phone calls and visit -</br></br>UCI: Can you still hear me? Hello. Oh, no. I'm not too sure if the line cut off again. I'm so sorry. But if you can hear me, please do call back. Thank you.

UCI: Hello.</br></br>Caller: Hi.</br></br>UCI: Hi, you have to keep calling back. I'm not too sure what's going on with the, with the line, it might be what we use.</br></br>Caller: It might also be my phone. So, I'm using my husband's to hopefully that'll, that'll help.</br></br>UCI: Oh, thank you so much.</br></br>Caller: Yeah, I'm sorry, I keep losing you. Hopefully this will work.</br></br>UCI: Oh, thank you. I also restarted application in case it was that.</br></br>Caller: Awesome.</br></br>UCI: Okay, the next question I have for you is, what has it been like? We're actually, you kind of answered this one already. But if you'd like to elaborate a little more, what has it been like to have reduced visitation?</br></br>Caller: Well, that's been really hard on all of us. My sister's going to be going, my sister and my brother in law, they're going to be going on trial soon. So, the more contacts we can have, the better they're going through a lot.</br></br>

So, and like I said, it's very expensive. And sometimes, you know, I'll use, I'll have like three phone calls with my sister in a day. And like, a lot of the times I just can't even afford visits at the end of it.</br></br>UCI: Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that.</br></br>Caller: Thank you.</br></br>UCI: Do you think, do you feel like there's anything that the facility could have done to make the situation better for you and your sister?</br></br>Caller: Well, I definitely feel like they could have given her vaccine sooner. And as far as visits go, like I have, I really have no idea why they couldn't let us continue to have in person visits, when everything else around us was opening. I don't know if it's like a lack of employees or what it is. But to me, it just feels like you know, they've gotten used to not having to do it.</br></br> 

And so, why do it if they don't need to. And they see, possibly the technology is, you know, like, Oh, why do they need in person visit if they can see each other this way? So, but also, there's the clear concern about my sister getting sick, so they could definitely be wearing masks. I mean, I think that's the easiest thing that they can do to help.</br></br>UCI: Definitely, by any chance, have you heard of the California mandate where anybody who works for like a California state prison has to or California state facility has to be vaccinated? Have you guys heard anything about that?</br></br>Caller: No, I didn't.</br></br>UCI: It was passed maybe about a month ago. Yeah. So, people who are like the guards who are not vaccinated, they should not be going into work. And that's something we hear that not a lot of facilities know about. And actually, a lot of guards keep going into work.</br></br>Caller: That does not surprise me they seem to show such a callous disregard. And unfortunately, that seems to be the, I hate to sound like political but I don't think it is political to say anti-vaxxers and anti-maskers. You know, a lot of them, you know, fit the demographic to be in that career field.</br></br>UCI: Yeah, definitely. I feel you on that one. Was there anything else you'd like to share or add?</br></br>Caller: Oh, let me look cause I did write a list. I wasn't sure. Like, to some of this isn't about COVID I wasn't sure if this was like an everything sort of thing. My sister said ACLU was like, okay.</br></br> 

So, deputies don't all wear masks properly. Excuse me, provide full program. I think that was it as far like, as I'm, I'm not sure if you heard all that I said, so I'll just go over my quick thing.</br></br>So, like I said before, she got her vaccine. She was on a waiting list, then 10 people had to be on that list before she got it. And yeah, actually, that's it.</br></br>UCI: Okay, that was it on the list of questions that we have to ask you. But I did want to ask some follow up questions just based off of stories that I've heard and, yeah, just other experiences that I've gotten to listen to. Caller: Okay.</br></br>UCI: And in that time that you mentioned where we're like, there was no visitation. I know, I heard from a lot of people that there was like zero contact at all for a couple of months. Was that the case with you guys?</br></br>Caller: No, it wasn't. I mean, no. Maybe like a day or two when things were like weird. But no, there wasn't like a lot like that. No. I lost my mind.</br></br>UCI: Okay, that's awesome to hear. Yeah, actually, that was the follow up question that I had this because, yeah, that's like a common theme that we heard of at the beginning of the pandemic.</br></br>Caller: Awful, oh my gosh, so stressful.</br></br>UCI: Definitely, I don't know if you've gotten a chance to look at our website. But there's a lot of stories there where you can actually listen to inmates calling in or listen to stories that they written in.</br></br>Caller: What’s the name of the site?</br></br>UCI: It's called PrisonPandemic.</br></br>Caller: Okay. I don't even know why I need to write that down. Okay, yeah, I’m going to look into that. That's awful. Well, thank you so much for your time.</br></br>UCI: Thank you so much for calling. I am so glad that I got to get a call from a family member. That's not a common thing we get.</br></br>Caller: Yeah, you know, my sister was afraid that if she tried to call that well, first of all, she never knows when she's going to program. It's never the same. But she's always afraid that deputies will treat her worse if they are listening to the phone call. And you know. So, I try to do things like that for her if I can.</br></br>UCI: Thank you so much. I am sorry to hear that she feels that way. She doesn't feel safe enough to make the call. On our end, we tried to make it as anonymous as possible. So like, anytime you mentioned her name that would get blurred out so none of her personal information will get posted on the site.</br></br>Caller: Great, thank you. </br></br>UCI: Yeah, of course.</br></br>Caller: Thank you for reassuring me on that.</br></br>UCI: Oh, yeah. But if she also feels more comfortable writing a letter, that's also something she can do. Okay. Which the information should be on the on the page that she got on the letter?</br></br>Caller: Okay. All right. I'll let her know in case there's anything I forgot.</br></br>UCI: Okay, thank you so much for calling again.</br></br>Caller: Thank you so much.</br></br>UCI: Thank you. Have a good night. Bye. Bye.</br></br>Caller: You as well. Bye.
