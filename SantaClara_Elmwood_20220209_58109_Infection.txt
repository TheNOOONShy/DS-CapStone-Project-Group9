UCI: Thank you for sharing. I have a couple of follow up questions. How has the vaccination situation been like at your facility?</br></br>

Caller: The vaccination situation. We had tablets in the - to keep us busy inside of the quarantine dorm. Now the tablets have never been charged, or we'd have to buy headphones or somehow get headphones that were bought on commissary. So, it wasn't very easy.</br></br>

But once we were on the tablets, there was an update given stating how the COVID would - how that the COVID vaccinations would go such as booster shots. They would do like intervals of coming in every other day.</br></br> 

Not even that. Maybe like every other – every so often. And doing cotton swabs on certain individuals.</br></br> 

And I got three of them, you know, they asked do you want to? Yes or no? And I had three, you know, three of them. Better be safe than sorry.</br></br>

I'd had my Johnson & Johnson vaccination when I was out there. So, they state on the - on the update the Johnson & Johnson vaccination - they - they state that you should get one within two months after your vaccination, a booster shot. And you can get vaccinated with the Moderna or the - the other one.</br></br>

The P-F-I-Z-E-R. And Pfizer or whatever. And you can get two vaccinations.</br></br> 

Now they're doing pretty good with the vaccinations. They give like – me, I haven't got one. I'm not gonna to be here long enough for that. But they - they say you get like commissary, or you get a goodie bag with some commissary in it.</br></br>

And a 30-minute phone call time. And proof of the vaccination once you're out within – so, you get like a vaccination one, and then number two, you get two weeks later, a week and a half later, and then it takes around two weeks. And then the vaccination proof would be inside your property.</br></br>

That's how that's going. That's from what I've heard. But I've also heard that the 30-minute phone call wasn't given.</br></br>

The commissary was never given. Stuff like that. So, I mean who knows? Some people just need to have patience. And some people, you know, they exaggerate.</br></br>

But, you know, I'm pretty sure things don't always come like they say in here. Like commissary. When I ordered my commissary, it took a couple days for the commissary to come into our dorm after it moved.</br></br>

Times are pretty stressful, you know. But yeah, that's pretty much how that's working.
