But yeah here my story OK for me I’m just lookin at the world and seeing what’s going on up all night watching the new’s seeing the COVID-19 hit my home town me trying to be safe everyday being in here wearin my mask’s “KN95” scare that I might catch it so I would go to sleep with it on. </br></br>


I know your not suppose to sleep with them on but I wanted to be real safe, plus I have asthma so my mind was all over the place I was terrify for my life my family was on my mind I started back working out to keep my mind as positive lockup in a dorm with like 18 to 23 inmate’s all day and no social distancing and not that much help to prevent the spread you got people that was not taking this pandemic seriously like at all it was really sad you know in all reality the CO’s acting like this was a big game walkin around on the yard’s with no mask’s on at all. </br></br>


Bring the virus right to us and when I was trying to tell them that my life “matters very much” and one of the CO’s told me man you're not going to die and that right there told me that they did not care not only about my life but any other inmate’s life at all. </br></br>


Just come to work and makin everything miserable for me when I am already in this pandemic going through these challenge’s in life. I would never wish this on anyone it mess with your state of mind you know. </br></br>


Just think about it if somebody did not have family and end up hurting their self’s all because these people are not doing their job’s right our live’s are in their hand’s. I know right hard to think about this is what I’m going through everyday in here and that ain’t the half.
