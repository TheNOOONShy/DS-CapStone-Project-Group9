In November 22, 2020 our block was under quarantine due to positive tests. Staff was re-housing all positive tests in another block. My cell tested positive, and had to move staff also advised me that I would be moving as well. </br></br> Of course I questioned the officers “why are you guys moving me when I tested negative?” Officers said that they had to quarantine me because my celly tested positive. But our block was already under quarantine, so they could have just left me there. </br></br> I have a parole board hearing coming up so I complied with staff to avoid a rule violation report (write-up) for denial of re-housing or delaying a peace officer. I didn’t want any problems. </br></br>
So my celly that tested positive was rehoused in another block and a separate cell from me. I was rehoused in the same block as my celly, but a different cell. The cell I had to take was with another person to which after a week infected me with Covid-19. </br></br> Staff made me bunk with someone who tested positive with to Covid-19, prior to bunking up with me. It was so frustrating, I’m still frustrated because I have lost my sense of taste and smell for over 2 months now. </br></br> Staff separated me from a cellmate that tested positive, just to cell me up with another person that tested positive, to which infected me. It made no sense, I try not to take it personal, but it sure seemed that way. If I tested negative, why have me bunk with somebody that tested positive, especially after my previous cell-mate tested positive. </br></br> November 22, 2020 they rehoused all positive tests, but I never tested positive, only on December 8th 2020, after I had to bunk with someone that tested positive. I even filed a grievance requesting single cell status due to this discrepancy and it was declined. </br></br>
You would think, all movement would stop with a virus like this. Staff instead has done the opposite in the past 3 months. They have had me moved over 5 to 6 times with 4 different cellmates… No wonder why they had an outbreak here. </br></br> I’ve never moved so much, more in the past 3 months than 12 years of me being incarcerated. Then to top it off, my family scheduled a video visit on January 9, 2021 for my mother’s birthday. I had already been previously cleared by medial to be isolation free. </br></br> I passed all the protocols. However staff then re-houses me in a block that was, not isolation free and supposedly for that reason staff cancelled the video visit. A video visit cancelled because they placed an isolation free inmate in a non isolation free block. </br></br> Oh, and let me remind you, I was moved from an isolation free block to a non isolation free block the day before my video visit was supposed to take place (January [redacted], 2021). Trying to n ot to take this personal. </br></br> But it is really hard not to because my family has been sending me mail to which I have not received at all, let alone in timely manner. They only run phone calla every 3 to 5 days and 15 minute phone call my family told me if I had received mail they have sent weeks ago, to which I still haven’t to this date. </br></br>
That’s just a sliver of what the conditions I face here at High Desert. Staff has damaged my television to where it is unviewable in one of the institution moves to me being placed on quarantine after a hospital visit in October of 2020 due to me being assaulted by my cell-mate to which the floor officer stood and watched, instead of sounding the alarm (they have it all on camera). </br></br> I filed a grievance on that too which it took staff almost 3 months to respond to. And even when they did respond, they refused to acknowledge my T.V. at all… Trying not to take this personal. But at the end of the day, we all know it is, clearly by the actions staff has behaved in. </br></br> Case factors play a role in it, I’ve always been discriminated on due to them, throughout my whole prison term I’ve dealt with this. I’m innocent of what I was convicted of, and don’t have the money to go through the appeal process. I won’t drag my family through that nightmare again. The actual trial was very expensive and judged over false testimony. </br></br>
