This story was told by a person incarcerated at Kern Valley.</br></br>

UCI: What has the COVID situation been at your facility?</br></br>

Caller: I recently just got here. I was in, prior to this, I was in Salinas Valley State Prison. So, I was in a mental health ward and basically it was different than what everybody else was going through at right here on the yard, so I’m not sure.</br></br>

UCI: Well, would you like just to tell your experience about, your experience with COVID?</br></br>

Caller: It’s just that, we were just lockdown basically. We were on lockdown, nothing was happening. A lot of people didn’t know what was going on at that time. So just, we seen it on the news, people got sick, but it wasn’t bad, so I’m not even, I don’t even have much of an experience to be honest with you.</br></br>

UCI: Mmhmm. And what is the vaccination situation been like at your facility now?</br></br>

Caller: Where I'm at now, I got vaccinated at Salinas Valley so I was pretty quick. I think it was pretty quick. We got both shots, and it seems, I think they worked quick.</br></br>

UCI: Mmhmm. And how’ve you been coping with the crisis?</br></br>

Caller: Just, I think pretty good. I think I'm just, we're stuck, we're stuck, so it doesn't make a difference [unintelligible]. I was in, like I said, I was in a mental health ward so like, we were trying to do, keep us busy. I just, we went on lockdown like twice and it was, I don’t know, any other day, kind of, you know.</br></br>

UCI: Mmhmm. What has it been like for you to have reduced visitation and programming?</br></br>

Caller: Oh that’s, I mean, all of that like the visits, not having visits is pretty good. That's craziness. I was going to write a letter, but I don’t know why I decided to call.</br></br>

UCI: Yes, of course. We’d love to hear any phone calls from anyone, and you are also welcome to write a letter as well, if you want to write more, anything like that.</br></br>

Caller: Sorry to interrupt, I prefer to write a letter.</br></br>

UCI: You prefer to write the letter, is that what you said?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, yeah.</br></br>

UCI: Okay, do you have our P.O. box?</br></br>

Caller: I do, I do. I got this letter yesterday, and I was just like, trippin' about what it was. So I figure I'd call and see what it does, like what it is.</br></br>

UCI: Did you have any questions that you wanted answered about the project?</br></br>

Caller: What is it? Like, what am I, like I kinda understand what you’re asking for. Like what’s gonna happen with this, like what are you guys trying to do, or what I can expect from you, or is it gong to affect us in anyway?</br></br>

UCI: Sorry, what was the last thing you said?</br></br>

Caller: Like, does it affect us in anyway? Like, is anything gonna be done about it?</br></br>

UCI: So what we’re basically trying to do is we’re creating a digital archive to capture and preserve the stories of the people that are incarcerated in California prisons right now. And, so, from your story, both this phone call and the letter that you write, we will transcribe it and put it up onto a website for people to look at.</br></br>

And we are hoping that, so we are hoping that, people will be able to understand what everyone is experiencing in these prisons and jails, and that it will give people an opportunity to do something about it, where they can look at the stories and write about it, or hope for change, or something like that, and just actually help. So we're creating this archive so that there is just a lot of stories about what’s happening, if that make sense.</br></br>

Caller: Okay. Yeah, no that makes sense. That makes sense.</br></br>

UCI: Did you have any other questions? Sorry?</br></br>

Caller: Do you mind if I just give this all out? Like giving you guys’ information to like the rest of the population?</br></br>

UCI: Yes, yes, of course. You are free to share with any of your friends.</br></br>

Caller: Cool. I’ll do that then.</br></br>

UCI: Perfect. Thank you so much for calling, and if you do want to talk about your story over the phone, you’re more than welcome to. And we also look forward to receiving your letter as well.</br></br>

Caller: Awesome. I’ll do that. You have a good day.</br></br>

UCI: You, too. Thank you so much. Bye-bye.</br></br>

Caller: Bye.
