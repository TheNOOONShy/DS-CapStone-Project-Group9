This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Centinela.</br></br>Since March 13, 2020, we have not had any access to the day room area. I was infected with COVID around December of 2020. Caught in a wave that swept this institution. Inmates went down every 20 minutes.</br></br>

Some were taken by ambulance. We’ve had one facility on my yard. During the time that I was infected, I was not allowed out of my cell at all. 24 hour lockdown for three weeks.</br></br>

I was given cough drops and pedialyte for hydration. After three weeks I was cleared. Most recently I was given my first shot of Moderna. It’s absolutely tough in here.</br></br>For the most part I try to stay busy in my cell by working on my college work, drawing. I'm a very gifted artist. I do very well with portraits, that’s my preference, realistic art, but I do marvel comics and fantasy art as well. However, I’d prefer to draw for someone I’m acquainted with.</br></br>I also stay active with working out. I love to work out. It takes away all my stress. I’m a very confident and positive person, I will overcome this. Thank you for your message.</br></br> 

It would be nice to hear back from you but if you can’t, I understand fully. Hopefully this quick letter helps you all out. Take care and stay safe.</br></br>If there’s anything specific that you’re trying to gain a better understanding on, just ask? I’ll be happy to keep you or anyone else on the team in regular correspondence to stay updated on the changes as they occur.</br></br> 

Prison reforms is hype right now, so thank you all for caring. I’m serving 27 years for a stolen vehicle. That’s a lot of us in here serving extreme sentences for non-violent offenses.
