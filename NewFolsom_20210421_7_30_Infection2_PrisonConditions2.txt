This story was told by a person incarcerated at New Folsom.</br></br>Caller: And on a quarantine lockdown, so far as the protocols go, only time we supposed to come out are showers—to come out of our shower and go back to our cells then back to the main court. They refuse to give me a follow up test or give me a rapid test. I had to do a hunger strike to get them to give me a rapid test before I left the isolation building at C8.</br></br>And they never gave me the results of it but I’m quite sure it was negative, otherwise they wouldn’t have been able to let me out of the COVID building. And the whole time I was down there, all my vitals, all my temperatures and vitals and checks that they did twice a day, everything was normal.</br></br>There was no symptoms, no nothing. And then basically, all their protocols that they so-called put on these memorandums that they passed out to us from all the way back from March of 2020, everything is basically been botched.And they’ve been upset with me due to the fact that I was writing these different organizations and sharing the fact that they’re claiming they’re doing one thing then doing another one.</br></br>That’s just like they won’t even pass out disinfectants, they won’t pass out scrub pads that we’re supposed to have to clean our cells with in here to keep ourselves clean and the air is disinfected.</br></br>And so, I was writing that up and then when I went to the COVID-19 building, they don’t mop the chairs, they don’t clean out the showers, they’re moving inmates into those cells as the other inmates move out.</br></br>They don’t disinfect the cells; they don’t clean the cells. And when I went down there, I took two 16-ounce jars of coffee containers full of disinfectant. So, I totally cleaned the cell that I was in from top to bottom with disinfectant.</br></br>And then I went down there on a Tuesday from that Sunday, they were tryna move me into another cells when they seen that I had it all clean and disinfected and stuff and I tell them “No, I’m not moving to another cell.”</br></br>And then he told me the door wouldn’t open and I said “Well, okay, you can leave it closed. There’s no need for me to come out. I’m not coming out of this cell until it’s time for me to go anyway.”</br></br>And so, the whole time I was down there asking for a doctor or somebody to explain to me why I can’t get a rapid test or why are you people not doing another test to find out that it was a false positive because of the fact that those with neutropenia, leukopenia, they all have some of the same symptoms as the coronavirus does.</br></br>And with the sarcoidosis condition, it states that sarcoidosis can easily be mistaken for other conditions or diseases that it has the same symptoms of. So, with this here, no doctor never came to see me, only the nurses that come and do the vitals check and symptoms check on second and third watch.</br></br>They always told me, “Well, that’s the only thing that they’re there to do.” And nobody gave me any insight on basically what was going on.</br></br>And so actually with all the stuff they have been saying here, it’s just like they putting out the memo saying that nobody had COVID-19 in this institution or this prison, which they was lying in the memos because we would see on the prompter—on the news channels and stuff—that you had 10-15 C.O. in this institution that tested positive and these are the things that they would try to keep from us.</br></br>And at first, they wasn’t pushing no masks mandatory and this and that and it was like as far as the mask goes anytime they got cameras on the yard, and anytime you’re somewhere without a camera around where you can just be, they didn’t care less if you wore a mask or not.
