First and foremost, let me introduce myself. My name is [redacted] AKA [redacted] from True Soldiers. I’m currently in jail for high speed chase, a gun and a stolen car. The pandemic has been hard on all of us. But in here, no visits for a year. They just started them up last month in March.</br></br>

Fifteen for some of these other guys, it’s been hard for them. Only phone calls for that amount of time, they asked our loved ones to make an appointment to see us one visit a month. Also, 30 minutes visit at that too, making it hard for us.</br></br>

Well, let me start off by saying I was in prison when the pandemic started. At first, I was scared for my family, especially my mom and dad because they’re in their 60s. But for me, it wasn’t that bad overall. I was worried about my safety for a bit being in there.</br></br>

I’ve been coping with this crisis just fine, really. The vaccination have been given to us. I took the Johnson & Johnson vaccination on March 30. It fucked me up for a while, these last two days I felt better, but that’s all for now.</br></br>

Write back, maybe someone in there might want a penpal to write to and pass time with.</br></br>

Sincerely.</br></br>

PS Write me back if you need more questions. Let’s start a correspondence. Look me up on Facebook. Add me.
