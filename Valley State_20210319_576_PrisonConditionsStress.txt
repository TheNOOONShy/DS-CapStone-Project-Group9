Dear PrisonPandemic,</br></br> 


For me this pandemic is torture. I’m 5 years to my possible release and have been working on things that would show the parole board that I’m not the dipshit I was when I committed my crime 15 years ago. Yet all that got put on hold because of the pandemic. So now something that was going to be difficult in the first place is going to be all the more complicated depending on how long it takes to open back up.</br></br> 


I personally cope with things like this by escaping into my artwork and/or crocheting along with reading books. But unless I get to the meager book cart on the yard before it’s raided the only reading materials I get are those that my family buy using their precious little income. The library while vast is off limits unless you have an open court case and even that is a weird hard to explain protocol.</br></br> 


So I turn to my artwork mostly but with my headspace full of depression and anxiety (among many others) I find even that hard to enjoy and escape into. Crocheting is a nice change because I can make things for others that is useful for other things than a dartboard. Yet the conundrum of getting yarn without using up the little income friends and family have rears its head again. So I usually make do with watching the boobtube (tv). Do to the fact that we don’t to get out as often as before and not on a regular basis exercising is a non-starter. Thus 75% of the population has gained weight the other 25% are those freaks that can eat anything without consequence.</br></br> 


As previously mentioned we only get 4 calls per cell of 8 people so the frequency in which I can call home is not what it used to be. That 15 minutes escape I’ve come to realize means more to me and others than we previously thought. Already there have been more fights over the phones than there has been an entire 5+ years I’ve been at this prison.</br></br> 


As for my safety I really don’t feel as safe as I used to. The environment has changed so much, not just in my cell living arrangements, but also that of the yard. People are more on edge and this tends to lead to violence. Inmates who have tried to do things and/or gets things through the proper channels and have been given the run around will target people they think are unsuspecting and attack them. Because after a fight (or worse) you are moved to the hole. So in their eyes it might not be the convenience move they wanted but it’s a bed move none the less.</br></br>


More people due to this new hostile environment tend not to come out of their cells which compound the outbreak of weight gain and even mental and emotional distress. Me personally I go to the yard every chance I get even if it’s raining because through this all I’ve learned that cabin fever is a real and dangerous thing. Another way I cope with this is writing letters to friends and family even though I know 90% of them will not be responded to. It still makes me feel like I’m part of something other than this horrid place. I live vicariously through others and the letters that I hope they’d send in return.</br></br>


Hope is a bitch let me tell you I believe that hope, not received is what leads to the majority of suicides in prison. Yet we yearn for love still, even knowing it’s dangerous (see attached poems). Since technology has become an everyday part of societies’ lives, writing a letter either by hand or computer has become obsolete. People either text or email each other, both of which are unavailable to us.</br></br> 


Thus mail, even such a one from a UCI student (hell even a bill collector) is cherished beyond comprehension. So once again thank you taking the time to include me not only in the world but in a small part of yours. Your gift of kindness to one such as I is a rare occurrence. Thank you from the bottom of my being. Best wishes to you and yours, take care and stay safe.</br></br> 


Sincerely,</br></br>
