This letter was written by a person incarcerated at CIW (California Institution for Women).</br></br>

I have two family members left, and both are out of state, so visitation is virtually nonexistent. Two of my boys committed suicide since I have been incarcerated. And how I remain sane?</br></br>

I am the bird whisperer here. I raise baby birds, fix broken wings and legs, set them free or parole them with staff. Right now I have a blind sparrow that will need lifetime care and I’m looking for the right foster.</br></br> 

I’ve rescued/released over 1,400 documented birds over the last 25 years. A labor of love. I was an LVN before prison. I guess caretaking is in my blood.
