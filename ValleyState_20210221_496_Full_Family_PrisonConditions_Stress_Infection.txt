This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Valley State.</br></br>

To whom it may concern,</br></br>

I am currently serving a life without parole sentence. Now dealing with that is extremely difficult. I have been in prison for 17 years for murders I did not commit.</br></br>

I am African American as well. I actually caught the virus back in September. I thought that I was going to die!</br></br>

The prison I'm at moved me to a quarantine building with other inmates who got the virus as well. My greatest fear was I wasn't going to say good-bye to my fianc√© and my family.</br></br>

While I was in quarantine, all the prison did was take our vitals, that's it! Then after two weeks of quarantine, they moved me back in a building that keeps getting positive results from other inmates.</br></br>

Then we can't even call our loved ones for two weeks. It gets frustrating at times. And as far as no visits, I understand and we have video visits now, but I can't wait to get our visits back.</br></br>

I am going to be getting married as soon as this is over, or when they start allowing visits again. Well, I hope this letter helps in some way. Thank you and God bless.
