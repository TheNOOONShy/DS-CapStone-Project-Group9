This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Donovan.</br></br>


Thursday 29th April 2021</br></br>


God’s blessings be upon ya’ll. It is always a heartwarming surprise when someone or some entity sends me a “how you doin,” letter from the world our there. The opening paragraph stated so much that is positive I was overwhelmed with emotions such as pride, joy, and hope which caused a smile to stretch my lips from ear to ear You say you don’t know me personally but when you wrote, “I also know you’ve got what it takes to get through it,” I thought, “she does know me,” haha.</br></br>


Well puttin’ all fun to the sides I shared this letter, I hope you didn’t mind, with several men I associate with on a daily and basically they were all envious and wishing someone would’ve wrote them too.</br></br>


I am 49 years old, and I’ve been locked up, GBI with coma, for 10 years now. I am of Apache and Mexican descent but I lean more, inhere, towards my Apache side. Being American Indian inside a prison we have certain privileges, we are accustomed to during our program schedule like going to the grounds, set aside by federal decree, so we can pray, gather, and sometimes make use of the ineepee or sweat lodge. Very sacred to us who are AMI. </br></br>
 
When COVID-19 hit all programming schedules ceased. Kapūt. Nada. Over!</br></br>


COVID-19. What can I say about it? I will say all of us in the prison system, inmates as well as staff, cooperated with Governmental restrictions. That’s a plvs. On the negative side you always have those skeptics, in life who laugh it off as a “big ass flu” and refuse to obey orders such as wearing a mask.</br></br>


And it is ordered that we wear them. I love it because I’m sort of a bacteria freak. Right on! Bring out the masks.</br></br>


Hooray! Early on in the month of April 2020 my cellie Redacted contracted the virus and they Quarantined our butts for 14 days. Horrible! Stuck in a 6” by 8” cell with a COVID-19 “Zombie” and I'm border line schitzoid when it comes to “Alien Visitors” such as bacteria and virus’ in the cell.</br></br>
All bad! I grew alot mentally at that time for sanitys sake. It helped that I gotta lotta luv for my cellie and anyways I didn’t have a frickin choice. Awww! Could you imagine?</br></br>


Everyone treated us, like with the greatest aversion, paranoia, and loathsomeness. It was like us against the world type of feeling. You learned real fast who your friends were. I forgive the others for their dislike.</br></br>


 They were afraid. I mean men were dying here. Luckily most of us have a fantastic type of mentality because no one panicked. I mean heck you got men in here doing life without the possibility of parole so for them COVID-19 was just a way outta this “bitch” sorry that's what we call prison sometimes. </br></br>


My bad. Please forgive my french. I just want to “real time” this letter for you so you can feel me, us, in the moment. Feel me?</br></br>


 OK. let’s move on. So anyhoo we got through that trial and lived. Praise God! Fast forward to June-July and letters and phone calls from home were full of sadness, unpredictability and sometimes hope.</br></br>


 I was, and still am, praying a lot. For family, friends, and even the regular Redacted out there or Redacted that were being heroes in the hospitals and firetrucks, police cars, and even our next store neighbor. So I kinda think of myself as a prayer warrior. I mean I got nuttin’ but time, right?</br></br>
 
Might as well use it for positive force in the universe. Humanity needs it. 
What else? I think of our safety inside and I am of two minds. One side I’m grateful we’re in this bubble, (prison), kinda contained but on the other I think this could be all bad.</br></br> 


Being in this bubble can be like a wild fire set off in a box and we ain’t got nowhere to go. Bye bye cruel world. So how do I cope. At first by biting the heck out of my nails but now fast forward again to April 2021 and things are 1/2 way back to normal so I can pray, I go to school, I work as a porter, I meditate, but mostly I think about going home, in three years, and making my way through what I got left of life in the most positive, successful way possible. </br></br>


One more question to answer and that's about the vaccinations. 90 percent of the men in my bldg. have been vaccinated. Hopefully the rest of the institution has followed suit. I hope and pray my letter was satisfactorily presented for your amusement, inspection or whatever suits your fancy.</br></br>


Bye bye now. Come again. If you are going to read the magazine please buy it. </br></br>


Yours Truly 
 
PS. My friends and I were wondering if you would write back and let us know how things are out there please be safe. Wear your mask. We ain't out the woods yet.</br></br>


Jesus is king! Hallelujah!
