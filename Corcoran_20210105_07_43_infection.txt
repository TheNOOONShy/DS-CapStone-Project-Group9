This story was told by a person incarcerated at Corcoran.</br></br>

UCI: So, like if you guys have any side effects, for example, like a headache or a fever they're not doing anything about that?</br></br>

Caller: No, you have to send an email request, which can take up to two weeks.</br></br>

UCI: Do they quarantine you guys, do they move you to like a different unit?</br></br>

Caller: Yes, they do move you to a different yard, but that's after you get seen, which like I said it can take up to 10 to 14 days to be seen.
