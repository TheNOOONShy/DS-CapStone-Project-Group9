This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Donovan.</br></br>

Hi, I am writing you on behalf of your letter you sent in regards to our struggle since COVID-19 hit. I’ve been in prison for around three years after being convicted in 2016. I was charged with pre-meditated murder, with a sentence of life without the possibility of parole.</br></br> 

Obviously everybody comes to prison with their own story and their own values and morals. My case is a high-profile case based around serious neglect of my mental health, spiritual warfare with supernatural forces, and demonic attack and persecution.</br></br>

Due to the circumstances of my struggle I am in a mental health program also known as [redacted]. Our program is more limited when it comes to the hands on more physical activities. Since COVID-19 hit we have been limited to visiting as well, which has increased our struggle. I am an active Christian and prophet so on top of being incarcerated I spend everyday being persecuted.</br></br>

I basically walk around and live cut in pieces. My sternum feels basically opened up, and something has my heart hanging out and is constantly torturing me. I’m barely clinging to life some days. I believe it is spiritual but possibly nuclear or digital terrorist.</br></br>

This battle followed me from the streets of Shasta County and hasn’t let up. My battle was brought before my probation officer and witnessed by many people in my life and community. But for some reason I’ve been neglected, and falsely prosecuted, and convicted. Even after reporting to my probation officer I called the FBI desperate for help and was denied.</br></br>

I was previously arrested 80 days prior to this incident. Reporting to the arresting officers my situation in which they completely deprived me of a statement/report failing to investigate it. And rather attempted to force me into restraints. Rather they literally and deliberately tried to murder me by breaking my neck in the back of their car.</br></br> 

As a real and honest Christian mom my greatest value in life is the heavenly kingdom. I believe and serve a God of conviction but most definitely can’t believe the neglect of truth and love in my case and life at this point.</br></br>

My symptoms and report to probation has and was spiritual sexual assault, and demons poking me with dirty needles and knives. Deliberately intending to inject me with HIV. Due to the fact that it was a Friday, mental health was closed. I ended up on a motorcycle literally running from this attack to a place I’ve never been before.</br></br> 

Because I had nowhere to go I chose to run to San Francisco. I had hopes that a stone I had found in the creek gold mining with my father was a 395 carat diamond, and was basically on a suicide mission to sell it.</br></br>

As I rode through Sonoma I got into a high speed chase, having no license plate and one rear view mirror. I recklessly eluded highway patrol and I continued into San Francisco. After parking at the pier I then literally witnessed the sky turn into the serpent, a giant dragon. He had one finger out scanning back and forth looking for me.</br></br> 

As I watched completely humble but completely amazing in disbelief, a tortoise came through the clouds and began to suck the serpent into his mouth. I could literally hear the serpent saying “ah! ah!” The serpent's tail then turned into another serpent.</br></br>

After this I witnessed a giant man with handlebar mustache holding a knife to a kid’s neck pointing me to drive south. Due to my circumstances I left the Harley on the street and began walking to the closest diamond stores. After being turned down, and three days in the street eating out of the trash can. God then brought me breakfast which looked like a dime and dash.</br></br>

Having to use the bathroom and unable to walk anymore I borrowed/stole a food truck which was running on the side of the road, heaven sent. Tired and confused I chose to drive back to Shasta County. This is when I was arrested, reporting the ongoing sexual assault, and was nearly killed by police.</br></br> 

While in jail I continued to be assaulted. Demons telling me that “They were demonizing me” as they threw up, shit, and pissed on me, stabbing into my body.</br></br>

They told me that I was going to be on dateline. After being released within two days this incident unfortunately happened. Being in prison at this point without anybody coming forward to support me, my case and situation, my time is completely dedicated to serving God.</br></br> 

I fight to put away all disobedience in my life. I have been blessed with a family that money couldn’t buy as well as friends that mean more to me than abyything in the world combined.</br></br>

Due to my faith and dedication, power and understanding of God’s word, the devil takes everything beautiful in my life a holds it over my head. Constantly threatening to kill everyone I know. My faith and service would look as though I was terrified. However, I serve and pray through genuine love for God and gratitude towards Christ.</br></br> 

Being locked in a cell for me has been a extreme nightmare, but the greatest blessing for the things I love.</br></br>

I thank God everyday for my family and friends, and have watched them all endure, elude, and overcome COVID-19. Unfortunately other tragedy has come upon special people in my life, and I was unable to be there to support and possibly empower my health and power, to practice a resurrection.</br></br> 

Most of my days I barely live through them. And all of my days, all day long I am being tortured. I am basically in another place spiritually, which we all are. but I have ports drilled in my spine and have a hose going to every vertebrae in my spine.</br></br>

Previous voices spoke of trying to clone me and my family. In which has completely terrorized me and tormented me with sickening petrified fear. I constantly fight every second of every day looking towards heaven and waiting for Jesus Christ, as well as COVID-19 program to change for the law library to open. So I can attempt to work myself out of here.</br></br> 

My IQ depends on the now ability to understand the legal system and live or re-live the continued trauma, terror, torture, and pain my life is full of.</br></br>

I was born with a nail size mole directly in the middle of each foot as well as in one hand symbolizing the makings of the cross of Christ. And have coincidentally obtained the side scar/pierced side, so I continue to endure with a greater hope, but the greatest pain. I pray for all those in the faith, and encourage all to make God and church the main priority in their life with the times at hand.</br></br> 

The pain on earth and in prison for me is a supernatural desperation. And we need all the soldiers fighting for God, truth, and righteousness we could possibly find.</br></br>

As long as our government supports homosexuality, which is a federal crime, there is no law and order in our country. The Bible says when you transgress against one law, you transgress against all laws. Which means there is no law and order.</br></br>

Unfortunately for me this possibly has led, influenced, and confessed me spiritually, to determining the decision of my actions to being here in prison.</br></br> 

Please pray for me. If you have more questions please write me back. Thank you for your love and support.
