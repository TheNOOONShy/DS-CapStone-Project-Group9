This story was told by a person incarcerated at Avenal.</br></br>

Caller: Um some of the medical staff have real negative attitudes and they kind of voice their negative attitudes around the inmates, which kind of creates a negative environment for the inmates in trusting the medical staff. So uh... basically it’s uh... kinda a scary environment.</br></br> UCI: Okay, so what’s the current COVID situation at your facility?</br></br>Caller: In my building, they have, they had one dorm quarantine, where they took them and when they test positive they grab the, they roll up the whole dorm, they send them to like a lock-up unit.</br></br> 

They’re gone 14 days, and then that one came back, another guy went and from my understanding they swooped on him. In our yard, there’s like I believe there’s four dorms and all the buildings that are in quarantine, and those are people having to go to dentist.</br></br> 

We tested back in May and there was like 90 percent of the building, this building came up positive but we haven’t, as a building, we haven’t did a complete test since. And with the amount of people that are coming up positive just to go to medical, there’s probably, I would assume 30 or 40 percent of the people that have it still.
