This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Pleasant Valley.</br></br>Dear PrisonPandemic,</br></br>May this letter find you guys in good spirits and best of health. Thank you so much for reaching out, your message made my day.</br></br>1) What has it been like to be inside during this time?</br></br>It has been very difficult. When the virus hit this prison, nobody was taking it serious. It started off with a few cases and from one week to another it jumped to hundreds. That’s when everybody started taking it serious but it was too late for that.</br></br>In the building where I’m housed holds 200 inmates. Out of those 200, only 20 of us did not catch COVID-19. I happen to be one of those 20. We also got placed on total lockdown, which meant we were stuck in our cells 24/7. It stayed like this for months.</br></br>It didn’t take long for some of the inmates to start stressing out and lash out towards their cellys or staff (CO’s). We also had an inmate attempt to take his own life. Luckily, they got to him in time and were able to save his life.</br></br>I’ve been inside for 13 years and let me just say that this past year has been the hardest year for me. I thank God for keeping me safe and healthy through these most difficult of times.</br></br>2) How do you feel about your safety inside?</br></br>When it comes to my safety, I guess I could say that I feel pretty safe. I’ve been doing time since the age of 12. I’m 36 years old now so if one thing I have learned from my time in prison is how to stay safe. I could write a book on the Do’s and Don’ts of how to stay safe while in prison. However, I only speak for myself.</br></br>3) What has it been like to have reduced visitation from family and loved ones?</br></br>It’s been one of the hardest things that I’ve gone through since I started doing my time. I haven’t seen my family for over a year. I also have a 13-year-old daughter that I haven’t seen since the COVID-19 hit the prison and we went on lockdown. It breaks my heart just writing about it.</br></br>I also lost my relationship of four years. To answer the question, it’s been devastating and we’re all hoping that we get our contact visiting back.</br></br>4) How have you been coping with this crisis?</br></br>I’ve been coping with this ugly situation by staying positive no matter what. I constantly read my bible, I constantly pray. I work out five days a week. I’m attending College through distance learning, that’s kept my mind busy.</br></br>I write letters such as this one. I talk to my family on the pay phone at least twice a week. I talk to my daughter once a week. I read books. My thing is to keep my mind busy on positive things. That’s how I’ve been coping with this situation.</br></br>Well then PrisonPandemic, I hope I was able to give you some insight. If you guys have any other projects that I could be of assistance, I'll be more than glad to help out. May God bless you guys and again thank you for your kind words.
