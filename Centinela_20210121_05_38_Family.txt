This story was told by a family member of someone incarcerated at Centinela.</br></br>

UCI: Is there anything that you'd like to say about reduced visitation and how that's been hard or phone calls..</br></br> 

Caller: It's been very hard, especially because we do have a two-year-old and we were only going up there twice a month. So he got busted when I was almost due, so I mean these visits, we cherished. We loved them, I mean my daughter knows who her dad is but, I mean she is two years old so, those little bit of visits we did have it was- she was shy at first but she would warm up to her dad.</br></br> 

Now it's just like, when I talk about him she's just like, "No I don't want to go to daddy." So now that we're finally gonna get our first video visit this Sunday, and I'm trying to get her excited about her dad again. She's like "No I don't want to," and that's heartbreaking. And I know we put her- he put himself in that situation, but it's just very hard on the kids. I can deal with it, it's just- it's sad to see my daughter, you know, react like that.</br></br> 

UCI: Mhm.</br></br> 

Caller: So, yeah. It's been hard.
