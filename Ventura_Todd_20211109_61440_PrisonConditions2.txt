They don't provide us with masks. So, yeah that's pretty much - it's the same thing here different day.</br></br>UCI: Okay, you said they don't provide you with masks, so they - they're not asking you guys to wear them at all?</br></br>Caller: No, they gave us one mask upon arrival, which is a disposable mask. It's only supposed to be used once and then after that - and they - they are really not reliable. They rip. The strings fall off of it.</br></br> It's the ones you can buy at like a $0.99 Cents store, and they expect us to - to keep those, and usually, they don't hand them out. They're very - they're short on them. Sometimes they consider them contraband for the strings. So, they try not to hand them out as much as possible.
