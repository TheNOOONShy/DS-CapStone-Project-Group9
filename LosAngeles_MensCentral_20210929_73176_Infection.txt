This story was told by a person incarcerated at Los Angeles County Men's Central Jail.</br></br>

Caller: Since I've been here, I had an 83-year-old guy that was next door to me, and they called him out. He came out positive for COVID. I never seen him again.</br></br>

Found out he died. Died in the hospital over here. Since I've been here, during this COVID, my father, who was doing life in prison in [redacted], he got COVID. He almost died from it and he's still suffering from complications from it.</br></br>

I've lost my uncle to COVID since I've been here. Right now, I can't even call my family. My mother's got cancer.</br></br>

My sister, she's going through breast cancer and chemo right now. I can't call her. I don't have no family support at all.</br></br>

I came down positive with COVID in here. The only thing they did with me is take me to the hospital over here at - next to the county jail. The only thing they did for me is give me aspirin.</br></br>

So, I sat there and suffered the whole time. Since I've been here too in this county jail during this COVID I - I have post-traumatic stress syndrome. I'm not supposed to be isolated like this.</br></br>

And - the the psychiatrist came and talked to me. Gave me the wrong medication that almost killed me, dropped my blood pressure so low that I fell out of my cell, cracked the back of my head open.</br></br>

And now I'm scared to even take the medication here because these nurses here in the - they don't care about us. They just use us for guinea pigs, pretty much. I haven't had a hot meal in here in three years.</br></br>

The dinner that we get in here is the only hot meal that we have in here and it's always served ice cold. I mean, I mean, come on, you know, this is - this is unhumane.
