This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Soledad.</br></br>

I know personally that CDCR has shown and continues to show a blatant disregard for human life. I myself didn’t have a lot of visitors before the pandemic. I’ve managed to maintain a strong, healthy bond with my family and loved ones by phone and by way of mail.</br></br> 

I can definitely see the effect it has had on those who have had their visiting reduced to none at all. Unfortunately, there is a lot more stress and anxiety in here, and like with COVID-19, stress and anxiety seem to be contagious in this closed-in environment.
