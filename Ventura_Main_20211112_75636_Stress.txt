  This story was told by a person incarcerated at Ventura County Main Jail.</br></br>Caller: And the truth is yes everything is restricted because everything changed inside, everything became like more difficult. People began to come out, a lot of people got out because they started to take out the cases that were not violent. And a lot of people left. From the people that were always here, about 40 percent or so left from the regular people that were left.</br></br>The truth is that that hurt a lot of us that were there because there weren’t people with whom to play with, there weren’t people with whom to conversate with. Basically, everything sunk here. No one would come out, no one would enter, the ones who were going to go to prison, couldn’t leave because of COVID. It was very tough, I had two attempted suicides while that happened. The truth because there’s nothing to relieve your pain, there’s no one to talk to or no one to play cards with. Even though I don’t really speak English, but everyone plays cards, and it’s a form of communicating with people.</br></br>And yes, the truth COVID, personally, did hit me hard because well my aunt passed away, my sister and my mom got sick. And I’m telling you everything that happened in jail, everything changed.</br></br>
