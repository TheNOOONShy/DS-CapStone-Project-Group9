This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Folsom.</br></br>
The 19 day of May, 2021,</br></br>
Dear UC Irvine,</br></br>
Hello, my name is [redacted], an inmate here at Old Folsom State Prison, in Represa California. I’ve been incarcerated since 1998 and housed here since 2016 (a summary of my experience inside Folsom during COVID-19). At the beginning of 2020 things here were routine. Education, chapel services, self-help programs, work, and yard time.</br></br>
And for a lot of lifers like myself that have been locked up since our teens, the seed of hope was in our attitude and behavior. New laws and prison board guidelines was giving us back the light at the end of the tunnel. Then around early February a lot of inmates were catching the flu, more than the norm. I kept hearing that this flu is kicking everyones ass.</br></br>
I hate being sick so I stopped shaking hands. It was weird, but I don’t believe it was COVID-19. In March the media began reporting on the coronavirus and it quickly found its way near here, in Sacramento and the prison officials slowly started to modify the program.</br></br>
I was moved from [redacted], a place I realize that the common flu had a hard time spreading. Buildings one, two, and three usually it spreads rapidly. I was sent to [redacted] because I work for CALPIA-Print Shop, I knew in this moment I wasn’t safe from “COVID”. Not many here were taking it serious at first, jokes were common around here, it made me self-conscious and embarrassed to wear a mask, because it did look like a jock strap, but with the death toll rising it started to hit home… it got real and the atmosphere changed.</br></br>
The correctional officers started distributing to us cloth mask and a little container of hand sanitizer. I was sleeping with my mask on. I knew it was a matter of time for COVID to enter this prison. When I heard about the outbreak in San Quentin State Prison and learnt that officer from here was being sent to do over time during the outbreak I was like, “ah, hell no”.</br></br>
I started to listen to the experts closely and bought all the essential vitamins (C, D, E, Zinc and a multi-vita). Got me some garlic pills and cut out the sugar. I needed to prepare my body for what was coming. Then it got here. It rapidly spread through building two, then it got to building three and one, still with all my thoroughness to protect myself, I got COVID-19 on September 1, 2020.</br></br>
It didn’t hit me hard, but I was a long hauler, for months I had a headache and an inability to focus and a nervous type of feeling in my chest. 1,352 inmates contracted COVID-19 here and two died. One of ‘em was my friend [redacted] also known as [redacted]. I met him when I first got here, he lived a few cells from mine, he was also the TA (teacher’s assistant) in my GED class. He was the one motivating and making the subject I hate the most fun for me.</br></br>
[Redacted] had type 1 diabetes, he always stood in shape and played soccer. In 2018, I seen him looking unhealthy and I told him if he was doing OK and then said, he thinks he got cancer and he was waiting on blood results. A short time later I seen him again and he said, “no cancer”.</br></br>
He was looking worse though, he was even using a cane. A few weeks go by and I see him again and he gives me a hug and he tells me they have been giving him the wrong medication and that was what was deteriorating him. He said he told his family and they were going to sue them. Months go by and I see him again and he’s looking a lot healthier, I even gave him a complement and told him he looks like a Mexican George Clooney.</br></br>
It is sad to lose such a man like [redacted]. He was also a facilitator in the Alternative to Violence program and his humbleness, thoughtfulness, and his willingness to help and encourage, impacted so many that crossed his path. On another note, during this challenging time is this tug of frustration with my sister and her family.</br></br>
They are my core. My parents reside in heaven. So it has baffled me to talk to my sister that lives in Arizona. She’s taken on an attitude that underestimates the coronavirus, to me it is obvious she is watching Fox News and listening to Trump and his followers.</br></br>
It’s frustrating because I know this hesitancy to take the vaccine puts her life in danger and so many of our loved ones. From this prison cell all I can do is to pray that we all get through this, learn from our many mistakes, increase our ability to see truth, fairness, and justice. I pray also we value human life and the human race as one. It is through actions of caring people that we are getting through this difficult time.</br></br>
