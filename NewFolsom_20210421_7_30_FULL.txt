This story was told by a person incarcerated at New Folsom.</br></br>Caller: As of right now, dealing with the COVID experience, right, I have three or four, actually I have about close to 10 underlying medical conditions, right.</br></br>And so basically what it was when I refused to take the vaccine, due to my neutropenia condition, it tells me not to take the live vaccine or be around people that has taken a live vaccine due to that medical condition, right.</br></br>Now, about a week after that, after I refused, two days after I refused, then they tried to get the social worker to try to get me mentally unfit where they could try to force it over on me. And then the social workers cleared me and stated that I knew exactly what I was doing, and I showed her my medical paperwork.</br></br>So that was on the 19th, and on the 26th of January, now all of a sudden, I got a positive COVID-19 test they claim. And they refused to give me a rapid test or they refused to give me another test and they want to put me in C8, which is the COVID-19 building.</br></br>And basically, I was trying to get them to put me in the infirmary because I told them that it was impossible because I have sarcoidosis pulmonary lung condition since 1992. I have an insufficient, a severe combined immune deficiency with my T cells and white blood cell disorder.</br></br>And I have asthma, COPD, leukopenia, neutropenia, and I have seven coronary conditions. So therefore, it would be impossible, medically impossible, for me to have a positive COVID-19 without having any symptoms.</br></br>Now, I’ve been writing to federal courts and I’ve been writing to prison law office and the health care receiver or the institution since they put us on the COVID-19 lockdown because of the fact that they were putting out memorandums and saying one thing, but everything was totally different.</br></br>And they’re not supposed to have inmates out when we’re on quarantine doing the feeding, running around, doing phone calls. As of right now, we’re supposed to be on a medical quarantine since April 14th.</br></br>On quarantine, you’re supposed to be lockdown in your cells, no moving, no nothing, but they have the porters out on both shifts—on second shifts, third shifts doing the food. They’re not supposed to anyway. And then they have us doing the phone calls and stuff.</br></br>And on the quarantine lockdown, so far as the protocols go, only time we supposed to come out of our showers, to come out of our shower and go back to our cells, then back to the main court. They refuse to give me a follow up test or give me a rapid test. I had to do a hunger strike to get them to give me a rapid test before I left the isolation building in C8.</br></br>And they never gave me the results of it, but I’m quite sure it was negative, otherwise they wouldn’t have been able to let me out of the COVID building. And the whole time I was down there, all my vitals, all my temperatures and vitals and checks that they did twice a day, everything was normal.</br></br>There was no symptoms, no nothing. And then basically, all their protocols that they so-called put on these memorandums that they passed out to us from all the way back from March of 2020, everything is basically been botched.</br></br>And they’ve been upset with me due to the fact that I was writing these different organizations and sharing the fact that they’re claiming, they’re doing one thing then doing another one.</br></br>That’s just like they won’t even pass out disinfectants, they won’t pass out scrub pads that we’re supposed to have to clean our cells with in here to keep ourselves clean and the air is disinfected.</br></br>And so, I was writing that up and then when I went to the COVID-19 building, they don’t mop the chairs, they don’t clean out the showers, they’re moving inmates into those cells as the other inmates move out.</br></br>They don’t disinfect the cells; they don’t clean the cells. And when I went down there, I took two 16-ounce jars of coffee containers full of disinfectant. So, I totally cleaned the cell that I was in from top to bottom with disinfectant.</br></br>And then I went down there on a Tuesday, come back Sunday, they were tryna move me into another cell, when they seen that I had it all clean and disinfected and stuff and I tell them “No, I’m not moving to another cell.”</br></br>And then he told me the door wouldn’t open and I said “Well, okay, you can leave it closed. There’s no need for me to come out. I’m not coming out of this cell until it’s time for me to go anyway.”</br></br>And so, the whole time I was down there asking for a doctor or somebody to explain to me why I can’t get a rapid test or why are you people not doing another test to find out that it was a false positive because of the fact that those with neutropenia, leukopenia, they all have some of the same symptoms as the coronavirus does.</br></br>And with the sarcoidosis condition, it states that sarcoidosis can easily be mistaken for other conditions or diseases that it has the same symptoms of. So, with this here, no doctor never came to see me, only the nurses that come and do the vitals check and symptoms check on second and third watch.</br></br>They always told me, “Well, that’s the only thing that they’re there to do.” And nobody gave me any insight on basically what was going on.</br></br>And so actually with all the stuff they have been saying here, it’s just like they putting out the memo saying that nobody had COVID-19 in this institution or this prison, which they was lying in the memos, because we would see on the prompter—on the news channels and stuff—that you had 10-15 C.O.'s in this institution that tested positive, and these are the things that they would try to keep from us.</br></br>And at first, they wasn’t pushing no masks mandatory and this and that and it was like as far as the mask goes anytime they got cameras on the yard, and anytime you’re somewhere without a camera around where you can just be, they didn’t care less if you wore a mask or not.</br></br>So, a lot of the stuff that they was doing and that they was presenting on the memorandums from Sacramento to here, the head of the department of correction, most of that stuff was false.</br></br>UCI: So was there anyone else that refused to get their vaccine?</br></br> Caller: There’s been several people that didn’t take it for whatever purposes that they didn’t’ do it. I would’ve taken it. The only reason I didn’t take it is because of my medical condition requires me not to take it.</br></br>And then when I was telling the nurses and showing them the instructions on my medical paperwork, then they tell me “Oh, it’s not a vaccine.” I said “What do you mean it’s not a vaccine?”</br></br>And so they start telling me this other stuff and I said “Okay, well if it’s not a vaccine, then why are you trying to get me to take it anyway?” It’s just been up in the air, and as of right now, I’m still trying to get a response to my medical appeals. I filed two or three medical appeals, tryna get a response to why such action was taken.</br></br>And then at first, when I was trying to have them put me in the infirmary until it’s confirmed that this is positive and that I have this, they had sergeant coming in to then, they was trying to set me up to where I was gonna get into physical altercation with other inmates trying to yell all over the kid that I’m putting everybody else in danger and this and that.</br></br>And that I got COVID-19 and they were violating all the medical protocols and custody protocols when it comes to that. So, to keep the peace because we had a lot of people in uproar—some with this custody and some against what they were doing—and so I just went down there and did the 14 days of quarantine.</br></br>
And the thing is that nobody in this section was tested positive. And see, I don’t go outside cause I’ve been social distancing with my medical conditions since 2013. So, the only time I go outside is to go to canteen, pick up my special purchase or package, and go to the law library and go to medical ducat.</br></br>So I’m wondering, if nobody in this section has COVID-19, and they go outside everyday, and I’m staying in my cell, and I don’t even go to the shower, and when I do go to the showers and I’m clean, I just bird bath in my cell.</br></br>And so nobody else have it in this section and I don’t come out my cell; that was my own little self-made bubble, then how did I catch it and how did nobody else in here got it.</br></br>UCI: Yeah that’s a good thing to think about.</br></br>Caller: And also, I’m sending you guys a letter tonight also.</br></br>UCI: Okay, well we’ll definitely look at that. We’re looking at all letters we’re getting.</br></br>Caller: And it’ll be like more into detail. And, okay to make this real short, also on the letter, I put in there a copy of my handwritten of the medical appeal I filed on the situation I just explained to you, so ya’ll will understand it more in detail.
