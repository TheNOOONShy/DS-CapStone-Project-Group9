This story was told by a person incarcerated at Corcoran.</br></br>

UCI: What has the COVID situation been like at your facility?</br></br>

Caller: Well, the COVID situation has been real, it’s been like a roller coaster. And it’s at times, it’s been a contradiction in itself, you know?</br></br>

And what I mean by that is, of course, I mean, to begin with, you know, there’s only one way the COVID comes in and that’s through the staff that work here.</br></br>

UCI: Right.</br></br>

Caller: And, you know, we - we don’t get it. We don’t get out. And the screening of the staff is, well, from what it appears, it's not good enough because there’s constant outbreaks. There’s constant people catching it.</br></br>

And when I mean staff, not just guards, but also other staff that come in, they work here. Whether it be medical staff or the, the people who – the cooks who come in and prepare the food and stuff like or help us supervisors preparing the food for that matter.</br></br>

And they come in and a lot of times instead of them - they don’t practice social distancing whatsoever. They come up to us, they’re like, you know, just like two to three feet away from us. And they're constantly not taking it as seriously as they should as far as, you know, keeping the mask on and being social distant – socially distant from us.</br></br>

And it just seems like, you know, it’s more of a punishment when there is - or this whole pandemic has been more of a punishment on top of the punishment.</br></br>

UCI: Right.</br></br>

Caller: If that makes any sense.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, 100 percent.</br></br>

Caller: And, yeah, and for me, the - one of the biggest downsides of this is, like, for instance, even before I get into the biggest part I was gonna mention, for instance, you know, they limit our interaction as far as releasing us all outside. We get less outside time because they don’t want so much mingling but, you know, we all do mingle.</br></br>

UCI: Right.</br></br>

Caller: So it kinda - it contradicts that. You know? It contradicts that. Yesterday they limited the amount of people going into the dining hall. You know? Skipping tables.</br></br> 

You know? Using the social distance thing for the dining hall and yet when dining’s done they release all out to the yard together.</br></br>

Caller: So it’s such a huge contradiction. Like, why even go through that?</br></br>

UCI: Right.</br></br>

Caller: To have us do these things that don’t help anybody.
