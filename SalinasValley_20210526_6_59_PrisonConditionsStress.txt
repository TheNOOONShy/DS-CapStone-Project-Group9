This story was told by a person incarcerated at Salinas Valley.</br></br>


Caller: Well right now it’s much, much better you know? We used to go to the recreation yard, it’s our building, and to go outside, to exercise, get some fresh air, but now there’s two buildings that go at a time, you know? So we’ve been dealing with things much, much better.</br></br>


UCI: Yeah.</br></br>


Caller: Low stress.</br></br>


Caller:  In here, basically there’s people, they’re not, we were not prepared for this, but there’s a lot of people, they don’t know how to do nothing here, and they just stay in their cells, and stress, and then watch T.V. too much, for the stress. And me, I keep to read my bible and like I said, I’ve been in here 22 years, and I learned how to draw and how to do things to keep my mind busy and focused, you know?</br></br>


UCI: And you’re at the Salinas facility, right?</br></br>


Caller: Yeah I’m in Salinas.</br></br>


UCI: Okay.</br></br>


Caller: Yeah I just got this letter too, about a week ago. Cause this mail, you could send a letter for you guys’ facility or for you guys’ school. You could send a letter and it comes in here fast like two days but then they take their time because they gotta open it and they go through it sometimes. Sometimes it’s just sitting there and they pass them out when they feel like it, you know?</br></br>


UCI: Yeah and then when you send your letters, it takes approximately up to a month and a half for it to be processed, and then we will send you something back, just so you know that we’ve received your letter.</br></br>


Caller: Okay, well like I said when I put it in, I’m gonna put it in a big envelope cause I’m gonna send the drawings. I draw on a handkerchief. So it will be on a handkerchief and I’m gonna put a pair of earrings and do a necklace and a brace, with beadings you know so, you guys can  put it in there together. So however you guys want to place it in your guys’ story or.
