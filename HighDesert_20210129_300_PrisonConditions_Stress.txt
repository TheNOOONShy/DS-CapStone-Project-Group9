I am presently incarcerated at a new Jim Crow prison where these Europeans (cavedogs) rejects practice their weak ass racism and sexism and malice behavior is everyday and I call it malice in wonderful! And those weak ass racist honkies, and wetbacks cowards K9s come to work to provoke a Black man into a violent. And they only do it because they are safe; it sometimes they know deep down why they hate and fear the Black folks. And they wish they was Black!</br></br>

The hate that created hate! I deal with being incarcerated by studying Afrikan culture, literature, and writing, and exercising. And I embrace godzilla Black [redacted] priest state of mind, body, spirit, soul. And I truly believe in black power, and black steel structure, black and blue military, black and blue excellence, blue phoenix rising.</br></br>

I understand that I can only control myself and comprehend that I am my change, my behavior, and develop good habits. Against all odds, 2pac!</br></br>

Malice, desire to cause injury or distress to another. Cattiness, despite, hatefulness, malignity, meanness, nastiness, spites, spleen, venom, viciousness, also abusiveness, cruelty.</br></br>

I am real product of my surrounding environment and it doesn't define who I am! I am a true blood negus who loves Mother Afrika!</br></br>

If I were free, what would I spend my life doing? I am coming from the bottom of the street life or hood life and I am pushing a hard line with godzilla Black [redacted] priest. And bottom line I understand it's me against the world. The spirit of [redacted] life is how I find peace and harmony with myself. I comprehend that I am standing strong, alone, wise in a society where the Black man is under attack on all fronts!</br></br> 

Be real! Be honest! No struggle! No progress! By any means necessary!</br></br>

I don't have no family! So I truly embrace books and self love and self worth! If you don't struggle, you don't deserve to win! I am steadfast in the pursuit of truth, freedom, huru-free! The struggle will continue and victory is certain!
