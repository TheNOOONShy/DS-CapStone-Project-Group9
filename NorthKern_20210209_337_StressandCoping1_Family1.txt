This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Delano.</br></br>

I’m 54, a 7th termer for all the state of California and I’m not proud that I’ve spent most of my life away from family when I first started doing time in the early ‘80’s, our healthcare has not like it is today, our healthcare is way better and not as stressful. ‘80’s and ‘90’s if I had a toothache, extractions was all they did. And sometimes it would take a year just for that!</br></br>

These days, quick x-rays to determine if they can save it, if not, then yank-it. All in a timely manner.</br></br>

The severity of this pandemic could cause great harm for someone that is concerned about it. If they have chronic care issues themselves or if they’re worried about loved ones out there in the free world.</br></br>

This pandemic has and still is a big concern for myself. 2010 while at another prison on my last term, I had M.R.S.A pneumonia. One day I woke up with shortness of breath. I went man down, subsequently hospitalized at Mercy Hospital in Basic Fields California.</br></br>

All I remember was getting in an ambulance at Wasco State Prison making it to the E.R. then everything went black. Reading old medical receipt brought me up to what happened but one thing I remembered was waking up to my daughter’s voice and someone saying, “oh shit, he’s alive!” This incident became one of my worries if I had caught Covid-19.</br></br>

Respiratory problems then and this virus attacking our respiratory system now. Now, I don’t have to die in prison!
