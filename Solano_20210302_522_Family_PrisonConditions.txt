This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Solano.</br></br>The only thing bad or different for me with COVID-19 is people dying, otherwise to me it’s no big thing. I have tested positive but like when I had a bad case of the flu, I’m fine now.</br></br>This prison has no idea what they are doing. I am being held in a building numbered 15, in what they call dorm three bed six. We are told to wear our mask in the 2,000 foot day room but it’s okay for 12 man to go maskless in a 30 x 25 foot dorm.</br></br>They have move me eight times in less than six months. In fact that is how I tested positive. They moved a man from Folsom who was positive, into dorm nine where I was at the time.</br></br>They allow staff to work in both buildings that have inmates who have tested positive, then go work in a building with inmates who have not tested positive and a few days ago, they moved 11 inmates out of 15 building where they held me, who had not tested and some who still refuse to be tested.</br></br>I’m an old man and when I move I must push a 1,000 pound cart, so I lost my good job because I would not volunteer to move from 15 building 22 building. Just a few months ago, they moved all the PiA laundry workers off yard D and moved them to C yard. Putting all the PiA laundry washing on one yard. Then a few days ago they moved all who volunteered to, D yard, that is all PiA laundry workers. I did not volunteer because I almost died when I was forced to push a 1,000 pound cart a full half a mile from B yard’s gym to 15 building. I love my job but I love my life more.</br></br>My family sends me a newsletter that tell what’s going on with CDCR and the newsletter would be saying no buses were carrying inmates from one prison to the next but I would see from my job up to 20 buses go in and out from RxR with inmates going both ways.</br></br>You were asking how I feel and how has it been inside during the pandemic. Well I’m the lucky one, I have family who still love me after 47 years in prison, working every day at getting back to all of them is why I call myself lucky, I’m a family guy so the pandemic did not change much for me. On the street when not at work, I would be with my family, so since being in here and not being able to be with my family, I’m really a loner. So keeping inside is really part of my normal life, I would rather be alone than to be around 99% of California inmate.</br></br>
