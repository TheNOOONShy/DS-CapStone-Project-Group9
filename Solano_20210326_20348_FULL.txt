Caller: Quarantine viewed as punishment while COVID spreads in prison population. Choosing between taking a shower or calling your family has never been an issue, but for the residents placed in CSP Solano's quarantine, it's become more like punishment. As it stands, those housed in building seven and nine in CSP Solano, are allowed, on average, 15 minutes to either shower or make a phone call, once a day.</br></br>

Although these buildings have been operating as medical observation points since the middle of last year, there is just now some talk of giving those that find themselves in these buildings for 21 days, or more, yard access. Albeit, in the walk-alone or dog kennel cages.</br></br>

That is the normal observation period to showing signs of COVID-19. One person who was transferred in from [redacted] has been in building nine for about 55 days. Others for three weeks. All with negative test results.</br></br> 

In order to be placed in one of the two main observation buildings, someone in a general area has to test positive for COVID-19. Once that happens, the entire dorm, consisting of eight to 10 people, are isolated. So far, all buildings have been affected at least three times, and some entire buildings have had to be moved to, for deep-cleaning. Currently, buildings where a single dorm has had someone test positive is not cleaned by HSM, the standard bearer of hazardous or needed cleaning.</br></br>

On December 23, 2020, when D yard's dorm eight, building 21 arrived in quarantine building nine, officer [redacted], third watch, stated, "It's best not to even come out." He noted that those arriving have to test negative at least six times. That was in response to being asked what the program was and how long someone has to stay back there.</br></br> 

The following morning, second watch building nine officer [redacted] was asked about the assignments to cohorts that arrive. He stated, "No one's even keeping up with the cohorts. We're all just winging it."</br></br> 

The cohort design was set up by medical as a way to track those who come in. That means medical is in charge of the intake and release from isolation buildings.</br></br>

Additionally, on December 24, 2020, the first time those from building 21, dorm eight came out, it was with two separate cohorts to make their phone call or shower. However, there are days in which you are only afforded a shower and it is left up to the next shift to give phone calls. Unfortunately, they aren't able to accommodate that because they have to shower the side of the building that has not showered.</br></br>

With the exception of those who test positive, they are moved to one of the two gyms. With all mass testing attempts, there are some that end up with false positives. They are housed with many that are actually showing signs and symptoms of being infected with COVID.</br></br>

Additionally, the second dilemma, according to a recent report, asymptomatic spreaders account for almost 60 percent of the transmissions. In an incident occurring on January 8, 2021, one person in isolation building nine, cell [redacted], tested positive and transferred to the gym. His cellmate was moved to D yard, 19 building, general population, one hour later. That building is now in isolation.</br></br> 

Currently, the two gyms at CSP Solano are completely packed and there were two known, there were two known incidents where a person who knowingly had COVID was improperly released into the population, causing a cascade of quarantines for those they were housed with.</br></br>

In a separate incident occurring around December 28, 2020 at 6:30 p.m., medical released 46 people from building nine after it was brought to their attention of health director [redacted] that they were past the time of observation. That is, three weeks. Cell [redacted] brought this to their attention and were promptly moved with the 46 people three hours later.</br></br> 

They were moved to building 23 on D yard. The problem is, with mass movements of possible positives in and out of isolation buildings and those who are past the observation periods, it puts them at greater risk for catching COVID and those, but from those who are infected around them unnecessarily. One person, housed in building nine, equated the stay in quarantine buildings like being on death row because when the police come to your door at two or three in the morning, you just disappear.</br></br>

There has also been mass movement of medical releases from these buildings in the middle of the night. Two incidents occurred at 2 p.m. - 2 a.m. under cover of darkness. The transfer of prisoners in large numbers from a higher security to a lower security, according to staff, is new. This is due to reduced staff, a lack of gun coverage during first watch hours.</br></br> 

Previously, when prisoners were moved into buildings, those already housed were alarmed and extremely concerned, such was the case in buildings 21 and 22 on delta yard. There were minor disruptions in these buildings as prisoners were moved from the gym to these buildings. Residents took to the day room to ask questions and requested that medical come and answer them. They did not come.</br></br>

There is one porter assigned to building nine that resides on delta facility. He is housed in building 19. He was trained by HSM, the part of the medical wing that does the cleaning of infectious waste and hazardous material. On some occasions, by the time that person arrives, some of the vacated cells from those who tested positive or were moved to the gym are not cleaned according to standard. In three separate instances, volunteer porters had to notify building staff that the cells needed to be sprayed just as incoming residents were physically moving their property in.</br></br> 

The fact that someone housed on the lower level, general population, is escorted to the buildings for clean up, then go back every day puts at risk the safety and security of the institution through possible transmission. Clearly, medical is overwhelmed by the influx of COVID that has made its way into the prison's otherwise sterile environment through its staff. For follow-up questions, you can call this prison and ask for extension 5336 to talk to a medical health director. There you go, that's it.</br></br>

UCI: That's it?</br></br>

Caller: That's it.</br></br>

UCI: Okay.
