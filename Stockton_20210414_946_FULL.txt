Dear PrisonPandemic,</br></br>

By the grace and mercy of God Almighty, may this letter find you all in the best of guidance and spirits from the Creator of the Universe!</br></br>

Background summary: In 1995-1996, I was adjusted to the three strikes or 25 years to life law for the nonviolent/non-serious offense Vehicle Code 10851 and to date I have served over 25 years.</br></br>

During imprisonment within the belly of the beast, I have procured via college correspondence programs, an electrical diploma, carpentry diploma, an associate’s degree, Bachelor's degree, Master's degree, a ThD/Doctor of Theology, and a JD/Juris-Doctor Law Degree!</br></br>

Criminal Court Case: I have a pending federal case challenging PM (prosecutorial misconduct) for suppressing discovery proving evidence. An Ineffective Assistance Counsel for failing to obtain suppressed discovery and filing jury instructions causing conviction.</br></br>

And by failing to raise a mistake of fact/renting defense of an alleged ex-con/victim car on VC 10851 (joyriding) by failure to return car imely missing 6 am deadline by hours at 9:30 am! Additionally, I have a pending state case with an appointed state appeal lawyer challenging prop 47 called Safe Neighborhood and School ACT.</br></br>

This allows trial courts to reduce any wobbler (felony-to-misdemeanor). Any day, we expect a ruling sometime during this year 2021. The VC 10851 as a misdemeanor carries probation with no jail time or one day to three months in county jail.</br></br>

As a felony, it carries either one day to 12 months/one year in county jail or a one to three year prison sentence. This is due to the three strikes law with any defendant having two previous felony convictions on record. The state can elevate punishment to 25 years to life!</br></br>

If and when I prevail in this state case, my time is reduced from life-term to time served and be released from custody. If and when I prevail on the federal case, the feds can order the state to reverse conviction and release custody, and/or grant a new trial after over 25 years in prison. Via a civil lawsuit, may be awarded from one million dollars to 30 million dollars, which is the objective in winning criminal case for civil-case!</br></br>

The news recently reported nation that 390,000 prisoners are infected with COVID-19 with 2,500 deaths. In California, it’s 300,000 prisoners infected with at least 250 deaths including 10-15 deaths at my medical prison facility.</br></br>

California Health Care Facility in Stockton: Life is grim here, there has been no program beyond housing units since March of 2020. Only recently in March of 2021, one year later, the prison is allowing three to five inmates at a time in the Law Library and GED/Education, that's it!</br></br>

My computer class, which really requires a physical presence to operate computers, is by correspondence-paperwork, and is deficient and void of all educational skills hands-on! You are free to contact me and print freely as you may.</br></br>
