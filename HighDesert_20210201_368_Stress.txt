I suffer from depression amongst other mental health issues but I have made it past this virus and so can you. If you lost someone in this pandemic, keep them alive in your heart. Care for yourself as well as others. If you are struggling to stand with hope, think of me. I don’t know you but I will keep getting up every day and will stand with you in mind and spirit from the side of an electric fence.</br></br>

On my worse day of my COVID illness, I laid in bed alone in a prison cell struggling to breathe. Scared. Very scared. Would it matter if I don’t make it, I thought to myself. Who cares if I live? Nobody cares that I am factually innocent. It does not matter that I was falsely accused. The fact that I didn’t harm another person to get here in this prison is of no importance at this point. And my last thought, why am I fighting so hard to stay alive???</br></br>

Stuck in a bad situation under terrible conditions, in a pandemic, I found the strength to live in. So can you! Maybe I’ve survived so that my strength could be extended to you by sharing my experience. Whoever you may be I will keep getting up every day with the fighting spirit and a helping hand for you and those who need it. Please do the same for someone else.
