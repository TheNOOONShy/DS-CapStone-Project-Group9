Since I arrived at HDSP around late, I've signed up for school and rehabilitative programs. But was put on the waiting list, and was waiting for a while. I finally got into a rehabilitative achievement credit math class, that a fellow Christian brother helped me to get into. I attended about four classes, then it got shut down due to COVID-19 pandemic. That was back around 2020.</br></br>

Since then, I've been keeping busy and making efforts to better myself by doing in cell self-help packets that get offered here at HDSP. The packets focus on issues like anger management, addiction,  anxiety, and many more.</br></br> 

Since the lockdown, I've earned certificates competition chronos on, which teaches on how to re-think your story, change your life, cyclical pattern of behavior, and much more. Working on these packets have been a real help for me and have caused me to reflect on my mistake and bad choices that led up to it.</br></br>

I tested for COVID-19. I've been quarantined ever since. Due to that, what we get is a shower only once every three days. There's no recreational yard or day room.</br></br> 

What gets me the most is not being able to attend and continue in the rehabilitative achievement credit math class. Though I strongly believe that the in cell self-help packets do help my rehabilitation, they don't take time off as the RAC math class. They don't let us know if we're ever gonna do program again.
