Today was only the second time that there have been given yard and phone access for 75 minutes. And we only got to shower every three days. We have our temperature taken daily and we are fed in our cell on paper trays. Our premade food trays are delivered to us in metal roll away carts which are delivered to the building. Always cold with small portions.</br></br>

What has angered me and many other prisoners is the prisoners who are under quarantine get yard and phone access everyday. So, prisoners are now faking symptoms. Simply to be placed under quarantine, so as to get daily yard and phone access. I just need to tell medical I have COVID-19 symptoms, and I’ll be quarantined and get daily yard and phone use.</br></br>

On November 21, 2020, Saturday, when we were placed on quarantine later that evening, we were all given the COVID-19 nose-swab test. But prior to doing the test, I witnessed two female Asian RNs sorting out all the test and they had them all on the dirty floor. With no protection to keep them free from dirt or contamination.</br></br> 

When one of the nurses heard me complaining and observing them, they then picked up the big plastic garbage bags. The test kits were in off the floor, and placed them on a table, after first placing down a medical cover sheet.</br></br>

Then since 11-21-20, we have only been given two new medical face masks, which staff receive new ones daily. Because we are prisoners shouldn’t mean we get or are shown less medical care and attention. We are still human beings and this COVID-19 disease does not discriminate. Not all officers, officials, or medical staff treat us less than human. For some do actually care and I can honestly say I care for some of them that I know very well and respect.</br></br>

I understand the separation line, but the bottom-line is we are all in this together and should go beyond all measures to lookout for, and help and try, and cure one another.
