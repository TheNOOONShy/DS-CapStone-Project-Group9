This story was told by a person incarcerated at Fire Camp.</br></br>  

Caller: Hello?</br></br> 

UCI: Hello. Hello yes, so still UCI Prison Pandemic. I've already read the consent form to yourself.</br></br> 

Caller: I recognize your voice.</br></br> 

UCI: Yes, sir. I've already read the consent form to yourself. You can just keep on going right where we left off.</br></br> 

Caller: Oh wow, this is so exciting. So I was gonna give a big shout-out to the PrisonPandemic Project at UC Irvine. I'm just giving thanks because you guys are truly allowing a platform for the inmate who is literally being railroad and silenced. So, a big shout-out to you personally also.</br></br> 

UCI: Of course.</br></br> 

Caller: Now, I want to cascade into a different area of manipulation that has been perfected by the CDCR. So today, we received COVID tests, and considering the fact that we're inmates, which is not a lot, they're calming -- they've suspended a lot of the visitation, the face-to-face visitation. And I'm not sure if they're doing conjugal visits, but I'm assuming they have also refrained from allowing as many -- where they put some generic protocol in place.</br></br> 

I did, when I was in quarantine at Jamestown -- excuse me, at the Sierra Conservation Center, there was two guys that had conjugal visits, and after the conjugal visits, they had to quarantine for two weeks before they went back into the population.</br></br> 

Now, what's interesting to me is, you know for a fact that we're men, and we haven't female contact or male contact for that matter, for -- you know it is 2021, and everything's just a free for all.</br></br> 

UCI: Right.</br></br> 

Caller: So, there's organic urges that we have.</br></br> 

UCI: Yep. I got you.</br></br> 

Caller: I say this conservatively and respectfully, beauty is in the eye of the beholder. I believe it was Edgar Allen Poe that said, "For what is a rose in a field of onions but a weed?" But they -- today when the nurse showed up, she happened to be gorgeous, okay?</br></br> 

After they give the COVID test, they're offering that vaccine; you know what I mean? I noticed this at North Kern State Prison. I noticed this at Jamestown Conservation Center or Sierra Conservation Center. They will have the pretty nurses running around and offering the vaccine.</br></br> 

UCI: That's hilarious.</br></br> 

Caller: And most of these guys are like, "Oh, you know, she's beautiful. Look she's very voluptuous, and all her curves are in the right spot. We'll literally, we'll fall down and do anything for a little bit of attention."</br></br> 

I'm sitting there going; this is such a trap because it's the age-old temptation. You send a beautiful woman, you know, we're going to lust after that, and the answer is gonna be, "Yes, I will take the vaccine."</br></br> 

They've gone as far as to tell these nurses and nurse practitioners, I've learned about a nurse practitioner also, which basically means you are not a doctor, and from this point forward, the answer is no to any type of treatment you're offering me, in my opinion. They went as far as to tell them to notify us that if we do not take the vaccine, especially at North Kern State Prison, which is a reception center, if you don't take the vaccine, it will slow down your ability to mainline, which is as far as I'm concerned, a criminal threat.</br></br> 

Because the benefits that come with mainlining is you get the percentage dropped, which is something I don't understand. Imma to cascade there for a moment so people understand. When you're sentenced -- let's say you get sentenced to four years with half-time.</br></br> 

You get sent from county jail to the reception center, and then once you hit the reception center, they find out where you're gonna go, which takes about three to four months, then you get sent over there, and then you see committee. Once you see committee, you get your percentage dropped. So, let's say I was sentenced to four years with half, that means I have to do two years.</br></br> 

Well, all of the sudden, when I hit committee at the mainline facility, they drop my time to 1/3 time. So, now, on a four-year sentence, I'm only gonna actually do 16 months.</br></br> 

UCI: Wow.</br></br> 

Caller: That means I'm extremely motivated to be transferred. So, when someone comes and tells me, "Hey, Mr. Blank, you're not going to be able to get out of here unless you take this vaccine," guess what I'm gonna do?</br></br> 

UCI: You're gonna take the vaccine.</br></br> 

Caller: Well, I sure as hell didn't. I was like, "Hell no, I'm not taking that vaccine." But most of the people around me did.</br></br> 

UCI: God damn! It's a trap. Wait, that's crazy, though. The implications? That is insane.</br></br> 

Caller: Yeah, it's coercion. It's coercion because literally what they're saying is if you want to go and get your percentage dropped, you need to take this vaccine, and if you don't take this vaccine, you're going to be sitting here only getting your 50 percent time. So, people are encouraged to take--</br></br> 

UCI: And you're losing--</br></br> 

Caller: I've seen so many people that took the shot that are pissed off and livid because they felt like it didn't really impact their movement. Well, if you take the vaccine, you're not going to have to quarantine when you go to your fire camp. Well, guess what? Check it out.</br></br> 

The guy, who got into put into our transpac van on July the 22nd, 2021, where myself and five other inmates were transpac'd from Jamestown Sierra Conservation Center to Holton facility all the way in Los Angeles, seven hours away, and we made two stops in public and contaminated the entire rest stop and the entire Shell Station, was fully vaccinated.</br></br> 

Let me say that one more time. The guy was fully vaccinated. So, my question is this. If the vaccinations work, and believe me, I was asking everybody with a badge, especially if they have some stripes, if he was fully vaccinated and the vaccinations work, then why are you quarantining us, and why did you turn the van around?</br></br> 

So either A, you're upselling a product that you know does not work, or B, you're just completely incompetent. Which one is it? And they had no answers. So, I'm just gonna explain that real quick one more time.</br></br> 

UCI: Sure.</br></br> 

Caller: We were in the van with someone who was fully vaccinated, yet they felt the need to bring us all the way back seven hours after we had been exposing the public to the Delta variant potentially, even though the person who was exposed directly to the COVID was completely vaccinated.</br></br> 

UCI: Completely vaccinated.</br></br> 

Caller: Which, my opinion -- which, whatever that really means. Because once again, my question to the medical staff is,well why would I take a vaccination shot -- well I said, what about the people who took the vaccination in say, February or March or even January, if the new Delta variant is the one that's killing all these people? What good is a shot gonna do, that was created before the strain that's killing everybody?</br></br> 

UCI: Yeah, absolutely. Fair point. Jesus Christ.</br></br> 

Caller: Where's the logic? And CDCR staff, and I'm talking about sergeants, captains, and lieutenants because I constantly climb up that command ladder. I climb up that ladder on a regular basis to make sure that I'm getting their most -- well, supposed to be their--</br></br> 

UCI: Senior officer?</br></br> 

Caller: The highest-paid is the most familiar with the protocols. None of them have any answers. So, what I requested is they put a Magic 8 ball on the commissary list so I could buy it, and then we could just shake the Magic 8 ball up and see what it says about the success and the strength of the vaccine.</br></br> 

Because it's not really making any sense to me at all, I'll pay for it, and we can use it and all share it and take it for a little spin. Do you have any questions? This is great.</br></br> 

UCI: Oh man, yeah, for the -- for the sake of the program, I've been relaying some key details of your story. Everybody is extremely grateful. The program is actually reaching out to yourself and saying how grateful they are you're able to share your story. They were also, they wanted to know for the sake of information if there's another name that your facility goes by?</br></br> 

Caller: It's Jamestown. Let's see here -- Sierra Conservation Center. SCC is the acronym.</br></br> 

UCI: Sierra Conservation Center.</br></br> 

Caller: It's at -- Sierra Conservation Center is the facility that allowed us to transpac to and from Los Angeles. And they have a completely failed COVID-19 protocol. They were not prepared at all.</br></br> 

UCI: Yeah.</br></br> 

Caller: They're the ones that right now have an extremely active outbreak of COVID. That is all thanks to Dr. [redacted], who is the medical director there.</br></br> 

UCI: Wow.</br></br> 

Caller: Oh yeah.</br></br>

UCI: I don't know what to say. Your story's incredible. I'm -- I've been -- I don't know. It's inspiring.</br></br> 

Caller: Perfect. This is -- okay, so, I'm huge into the amendment rights. And the first amendment is sacred and important. So once again, if you guys think you should be appreciating me? No.</br></br> 

You guys should be looking around at one another and high-fiving and congratulating one another because no one else is providing the platform. Without a platform, there is no voice.</br></br> 

Anyone can walk around with a microphone. Everyone has a story. But without a team and without people willing to put it out there, there's nothing.</br></br>

UCI: Right.</br></br>

Caller: So, you guys are equally, if not even more, important for providing the platform. I just want to make sure that's a staple of this conversation.</br></br> 

UCI: Hey, thanks for mentioning that, yeah.</br></br> 

Caller: You're absolutely welcome. And from what I'm hearing, what's going on out there on the streets is, there's a tremendous amount of censorship regarding COVID-19, and a lot of the facts are hard to find and come by. Let's see here, what else do I have for you?</br></br> 

I have more COVID stories from North Kern State Prison, but I'd like to reserve those for another phone call because it's gonna require three in a row.</br></br> 

UCI: Yeah, absolutely.</br></br> 

Caller: And if I don't call my girlfriend, she's gonna be very displeased. She was actually out at a rally today for -- to support healthcare workers that are being mandated to wear masks at work and be vaccinated. So, I want to call and check in with her. Yeah, I don't know that I have--</br></br> 

UCI: Sure, yeah, of course. No, you should.</br></br> 

Caller: I want to call and make sure that she's good.</br></br> 

UCI: Absolutely. Hey, thank you so much for calling.</br></br> 

Caller: I don't know what--</br></br> 

UCI: Yeah. You don't know what?</br></br> 

Caller: Maybe I'll call tomorrow.</br></br> 

UCI: You can call tomorrow.</br></br> 

Caller: I'm gonna call you back tomorrow to tell you the story. I'm gonna call you tomorrow, about the same time, to give you the North Kern State Prison story, which is just as ridiculous and equally as absurd as the Jamestown Sierra Conservation Story.</br></br> 

UCI: Absolutely. For posterity sake, I would love to hear it. The line will be open.</br></br> 

Caller: Excellent. Do you have any questions? Is there -- and I'm not allowed to give my name, right?</br></br> 

UCI: Yeah, unfortunately, yeah, just if you did say your name, any personal information we wouldn't be able to put into the recording. But your story -- your story will be up, and you will be able to hear it, and anybody will be able to look.</br></br> 

They'llll be able to pretty well identify your story. I think, I'm not sure if it's dated, but it'll be given a specific headline and description. I hope one day soon that you'll be able to see it.</br></br> 

Caller: Oh, well, I get released in two months. And I'm a civil rights advocate on the street. So, we'll -- I definitely plan on tapping in with you guys and just bringing the information to the people. This country, supposedly, is supposed to be for the people, by the people, and I find it -- I find that concept to be very diluted.</br></br> 

UCI: Yeah. I loved your language tonight, sir.</br></br> 

Caller: Oh, well, thank you. I want to once again extend my gratitude to you and your team, you and your colleagues. Hopefully, you guys are friends; for taking the time because I know you're college students. And I mean, I think college should be free because we should be investing in the next generation.</br></br> 

But I know you guys are committing your time and energy, and efforts to these projects, so I salute each and every one of you. I love it and I look forward to speaking to you guys again tomorrow.</br></br> 

UCI: Sounds good. Looking forward to it. Thank you.</br></br> 

Caller: All right. Have a good evening.</br></br> 

UCI: You too. See ya.</br></br> 

Caller: All right.
