I would love to be in a class but we are restricted from school home study.</br></br> 

Wear a mask, temperature checks, nose COVID-test checks. Some go to other yards then have to speak up for laundry. Some are seeing having tablets a resource to communicate with loved ones, it's an ongoing process. Canteen and packages get delivered in bags. Some people get put on quarantine because of doctor visits 14 to 22 days in cells. Being moved to other buildings, testing, being placed in other housing units, trying to get back to original unit. Being spaced out with bunks, and some people go to other yards for quarantine like that already tested positive. They send them back to same building. Some have positive inmates in the group where they all sleep so the whole group has been affected by one inmate. Vendors stop shopping from certain package companies putting orders on hold. Families have to get reimbursed.</br></br>
