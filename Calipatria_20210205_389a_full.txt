February 2021</br></br>

In response to COVID-19 story.</br></br> 

I'll begin by saying that life has changed everyone around the world.</br></br> 

My name is [redacted]. I've been incarcerated for over [redacted] years, and should be going home in two years. COVID-19 has definitely changed my perspective in life. I 100% don't feel safe inside of prison.</br></br>

At the moment we here at California State Prison are going through an outbreak. The staff have allowed their guard down. I have tested negative for COVID over a dozen times. I've been requesting the vaccine without a clear response from medical staff.</br></br>

Oh yes, the virtual visitations sure sound great on paper, but for the last two months my family have been applying every week for a video visit without any luck. It's been over 11 months since I seen my godchildren and family. It's difficult for everyone. 

But I am thankful for my faith in God, my board participation for [redacted], and letters from my family that's been keeping my mind distracted. I've been doing a lot of reflections during this pandemic.</br></br>

In [redacted], I managed to graduate from [redacted] with several degrees (distinctions). I've been preparing myself mentally for my upcoming release. Hopefully this passes soon, if I'm paroled from Board, I'll be home by [redacted]. Just in time for my [redacted] birthday.</br></br>

Well thank you for being an ear. Stay COVID safe and lord bless.</br></br> 

Sincerely,</br></br>
[redacted]</br></br>
Calipatria, CA 92233
