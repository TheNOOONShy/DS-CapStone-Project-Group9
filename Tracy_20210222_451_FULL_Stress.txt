Hello,</br></br>

In an answer to the question, what’s it like to be inside during this time? It’s very scary, I feel like I’m going to lose this war. I’m 63. Maybe I’m going to die as the numbers outside approach 600,000 deaths.</br></br>

How do I feel about safety inside? I’m battling anxiety and depression. In such close quarters, two people sharing a cell that is only the size of a small bathroom, it’s easy for everyone to get sick. We breathe the same air.</br></br>

How have I been coping with this crisis? It’s given me time to read and study the Bible. I’ve come to the conclusion that God perhaps sent this pandemic in response to our sins against him and his creation.
