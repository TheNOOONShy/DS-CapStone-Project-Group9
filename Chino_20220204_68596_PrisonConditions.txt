UCI: Oh, okay. Nice, nice.</br></br>

Caller: I got the vaccine.</br></br>

UCI: Nice. Okay, cool. And, if anything — if you could do anything, what would you — what would you do to make the situation at your facility better?</br></br>

Caller: Shit. Try to be able to go home earlier?</br></br>

UCI: Haha. I feel that, man. Gotcha.</br></br>

Caller: Haha.</br></br>

UCI: And what about, like, the, the correctional officers? Have they been, like, giving you guys masks and cleaning the, the common areas and stuff?</br></br>
