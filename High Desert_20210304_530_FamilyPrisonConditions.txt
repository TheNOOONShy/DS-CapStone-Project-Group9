This letter was written by a person incarcerated at High Desert.</br></br>Obviously, prison through the pandemic has been horrible. Everything was worse. Till right now.</br></br>The worst thing about the prison system is that they keep us uninform. That is a form of torture. They cut your communication. Keep you in your cell for 60 days. Without any information. That is with everything. Program, quarantine, etc.</br></br>I really miss visits. Every human being needs the human touch. The human touch of our love ones.</br></br>I am not that fortunate to have a family that has $1,500 to spend for two days of visiting. Yes, that is how much it cost for me to get a visit.</br></br>CDCR may tell the outside world their focus and priority is to keep us stay in touch with our love ones.</br></br>But it is not the truth. They know where we all lived on the streets. Yet they always send you too far from your family.</br></br>The proof. There is two prisons that are only two hours away from where my family lives. Yet in 23 years I have never been that close to my family. It is always 12, eight, seven hours away from them.</br></br>It is obvious that, yes, I have requested to be close to home.</br></br>Now with the pandemic, there is a lot of people that do get visits. A lot of people. But now they are stress out, relationships get broken. Why? There is no physical contact. I can see them going through it.</br></br>There is so many people that depend on their families.</br></br> The phone is another way of fast communication. But even that is hard to use. I have no real reason why the prison make it so difficult to let inmates use the phone to communicate with out love ones.</br></br>I have a job from 4:00am till 11:30am. I get to use the phone once or sometimes twice a week.</br></br> I have two sisters, one daughter, one girlfriend/ex, two nieces, two brothers, one son, one granddaughter. So, I have to choose whom I talk to for 13 minutes.</br></br> Specifically, right now with no visits. Just imagine I am stress out with these situation. And I am use to not getting a lot of visits. I got three visits in eight years in this prison.</br></br>So, I depend on the phone. When one has not talked to someone for four weeks or longer, 15 minutes are like nothing. You can almost never finish a conversation.</br></br>Our phone calls are always getting shorted or cut by the COs. That is another bad thing.</br></br>So, if I get stress out, just imagine that people that are used to getting visits? They can’t use the phone as much neither. So, it is terrible.
