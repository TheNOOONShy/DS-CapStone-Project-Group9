This story was told by a person incarcerated at California City.</br></br>

UCI: So, we have some ready-made questions that I can ask you unless you already have a story you'd like to share.</br></br>

Caller: No, not really.</br></br>

UCI: Okay. So, I can proceed with the questions.</br></br>

Caller: All right.</br></br>

UCI: Okay, great. So, what facility are you currently housed at?</br></br>

Caller: California City.</br></br>

UCI: All right. And what has the COVID situation been like at your facility?</br></br>

Caller: It's been all right. I mean it was a - it was a real spread, like a lot of people, but it's been all right. I mean, there's been a couple people, supposedly, they said, that have passed away, but I'm not sure. That's just hearsay, but there has been a couple people that have been real sick.</br></br>

UCI: I see. And so, you haven't been affected by COVID much, is what I'm assuming.</br></br>

Caller: No. They tried to, they - I don't know what the hell is going on with the [unintelligible]. I had - they were COVID testing all of us, and everybody in the building I'm in had COVID. And there was only, like, four of us, four of us left in here.</br></br>

Everybody else caught it. So, I don't know what the hell they were quarantining them. They were quarantining them after that. I don't know, but somebody said that there was a couple people that passed away from it. I'm not sure.</br></br>

UCI: I see. And has any of your visitation or programming been affected by COVID?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah. We can't do nothing. There's no testing. There's nothing at all. And only one person can come. It's not like before.</br></br>

UCI: And has that changed at all over the past year? Like, was it more restricted in the beginning of COVID, and has it gotten more lenient? Or is it basically the same the past year?</br></br>

Caller: No. Right now it's still the same. It's been the same, you know, six feet. You've got to be six feet apart.</br></br> 

You can only hug them when they come in. And that's about it. They said they're supposed to give us tablets, but they haven't gave us no tablets for a long time. They said we were supposed to get tablets to be able to talk to our families more, but I don't know. It's been a long time already.</br></br>

UCI: I see. And have they started vaccinating at your facility?</br></br>

Caller: Oh, yeah. That thing right there too is messing a bunch of people up in here. They said the vaccine shots didn't work. My cellie got it, but he couldn't do nothing after it. He couldn't even get up or nothing.</br></br>

I had to do everything for him. I didn’t get vaccinated. I don't really trust it. There was a lot of people getting sick when they took it. They're still getting sick.</br></br>

UCI: I see. And how has the COVID situation at your facility affected your loved ones?</br></br>

Caller: Oh, man, they just [unintelligible]. Actually, I had one person that almost passed away. And it's just hard, you know? It's hard when you really can't see - well, actually had some visits away for a while. They're just barely getting back to us. But, yeah, it was hard, not being able to see us.</br></br>

And that's what I'm saying. They were supposed to give us those tablets, but I guess they never, they never came through. Now they're just letting us visit, but it's been like a little struggle. Not like that but just missing, you know? Missing your family and loved ones. All stressful. It's all stressful, and you're just in your cell all day. You can't even come out.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, I understand-</br></br>

Caller: I mean, they're trying to open it up a little bit.</br></br>

UCI: You said they're starting to open it up a little bit?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah. We come out for, like, an hour or two sometimes. They let us out. We take turns.</br></br>

UCI: And is that daily, or they just do that whenever they feel like it?</br></br>

Caller: Well, it's sometimes. I mean I don't know. They be, sometimes they be bullshitting, saying they're, like, short of staff or something. But it's like sometimes they'll just let us out sometimes.</br></br>

Like, they've been bullshitting, but it's all right. They let us out once in a while now. Or they're trying to let us work too now. So, try to get out of the cell. It makes you go, makes you go crazy, being in there.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, I can imagine. And how have you been coping with the crisis since I know, like you said, you haven't gotten much time out of your cell?</br></br>

Caller: I'm not. That's why I try to work. I try to work. I'm a kitchen worker, so I try to stay out as much as I can. I try to find things to get out of the cell. Try to move around the damn cell, and it's a little space, though. I try to keep, we try to keep ourselves busy either drawing, reading, exercising, you know, playing games with your cellie, play card games and stuff. That's really the only thing we can do.</br></br>

UCI: I see. And what would have made this situation at your facility better?</br></br>

Caller: Man, at least a little bit of program or something, like something at least. If they would've gave us those tablets at least, like to come through, those would've came through, to have those visits or email or people or see what's going on. There's times where we couldn't even get on the phone. So, how do we know if someone's good or not - our people are good if we can't talk to them?</br></br>

We could write, but even store, sometimes we can't be in there. You know, they would - you're going to run out of stamps or writing tablets and stuff like that. Not everybody's lucky like that. If we don't come out, how is somebody going to get something like that?</br></br>

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: At least a phone call. At least a phone call. If they would've gave us phone calls during that time.</br></br>

UCI: So, how long did they restrict phone calls?</br></br>

Caller: Oh, man. How long was it? How long was it? I think it was like, I'm not sure. I think it was like three months at least, so like three months when it was, like, bad, I guess, when it had just started.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, I see.</br></br>

Caller: I think it was like three months, we just had to write.</br></br>

UCI: I see. And is there anything else you want people to know about your experience inside right now?</br></br>

Caller: You've just got to, you’ve got to keep, you've got to be strong-minded, you know? You've got to find something to do, and you can’t - you've got to always stay busy, always stay busy and just as long as your body, like I say, your body is in prison, but your mind, it goes somewhere else.</br></br> 

You know, just always stay strong. Just think about what's going to come next. You know, the future should be better, at least. There should be something better coming.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah. So, you always have to think about other things than being inside, I imagine.</br></br>

Caller: Mm-hmm. Yeah. Well, it can only get better before it gets worse, hopefully.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah. And one more question about vaccinations. Does it seem like most people in your facility are choosing to get vaccinated? Or are they, you know, afraid to or they just don't want to because they don't have enough information?</br></br>

Caller: A lot of people think it's too soon. They think it was just too fast. And then they're watching the news about all these blood clots and all this stuff going on, and a lot of people don't trust it.</br></br> 

Mostly, it's like the older people. They're scared, so they want to, you know, they don't want to take no chances. But I mean the majority of us, like we don't really want to take it. They don't really trust it.</br></br>

UCI: And has your facility given you any information about the vaccination? Or have they just said that it's available? They didn't tell you what is like in it or how it is made, or anything?</br></br>

Caller: Oh, no. They don't tell us nothing like that. Well, some of us asked. We tried to say like, so, we'll ask them, "Are you guys taking it?" And, you know, they don't tell us nothing, but some would.</br></br> 

They'll be like, "Nah. No, I'm not taking it." So, if they're not taking it, shit, we're not going to take it. They don't even trust it themselves.</br></br>

But, no, they only tell us stuff, like “Confine yourself, Keep distance” and stuff like that. They put, like, alcohol in here and like the fucking hand sanitizer. They put all that stuff there, but they don't really tell us nothing about it.</br></br> 

They haven't actually told us nothing about it lately. I think it's, "Do you want to take it?" I'm not sure, but they haven't told us nothing about it lately.</br></br>

UCI: I see. And do you think it would help if your facility gave you more information? Or would you still not trust it because it's coming from the facility?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah. Well, if they were to tell us like, yeah, they could give us more information about it, sure. I mean we've got to know what it does, what's in it. I mean I don't think they know, though.</br></br> 

I don't even think they know, but I don't know. If they were to tell us more information instead of just saying, "Do you want to take it or not?" then I guess we would feel a little better, at least knowing what's in it or something.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, I understand. Okay. So, if you have, do you have anything else you wanted to share, anything that comes to mind that you know, would want on the website for, you know, all the public to read?</br></br>

Caller: Hmm. Let me see. Well, I will actually want to thank the people out there, you know? Thank the people out there that are- are helping everybody, trying to - you know. There's a couple of things out there trying to help with us in here, like what do you call them? Unite the People. Unite the People.</br></br>

And there’s another, there's people out there trying to help. And there's people, like, doing the same thing, you know, trying to make sure we're good and all that stuff. So, as long as there's people out there, you know, that keep in mind, that always feels good. To let them we know we're not forgotten.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, exactly. And this is exactly what this project is for. So, we hope that, you know, you sharing your story will inform other people better about the importance of, you know, like you said, caring about the people inside these facilities. So, I thank you for participating in PrisonPandemic, and please consider telling your friends about us and seeing if they would like to call in as well.</br></br>

Caller: Yes, ma'am. I'll do that.</br></br>

UCI: Okay. Thank you so much for calling, again. And have a good night.</br></br>

Caller: All right, ma'am. Likewise. Have a good night. Take care.</br></br>

UCI: You too. Bye-bye.
