This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Soledad.</br></br>

A lot of people don't want to say they're sick. It's spreading all over the yard. It's scary, to see so many ambulances come to pick up people sick. Also the ventilation systems, I think, are spreading this virus.</br></br> 

They don't change out the filters like you would do at your home. Prison is different. We are at the mercy of the CDC. I do the best I can to stay clean from this virus and always wash my hands with soap and water for 20 seconds. I hope that this gives you a look at how it's going in here at CTF Soledad.</br></br> 

I'm not sure how things could get better here. But I pray that Jesus Christ shows mercy to us here at CTF Soledad. My Christmas was on lockdown with no store canteen.</br></br> 

My New Year's resolution is to be COVID-free and survive the storm we are going through where we can't even talk to our loved ones. I worry about my mother and family and friends on the streets. That they are safe and blessed.</br></br> 

I miss my life and I pray to once again be able to go back into society and prosper like I was before my incarceration.
