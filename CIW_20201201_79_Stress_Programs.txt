This letter was written by a person incarcerated at CIW (California Institution for Women).</br></br>So you wanted to know how I am handling being here and dealing with COVID-19. To be honest it hasn't been easy. And I also might be able to give you a little bit of a different take. I am housed in the mental health unit.</br></br>

However when the pandemic first started I was on the GP yard. But I have always struggled with mental problems such as depression, pica, (which is I eat things like batteries, razors, paper clips) I eat metal, others eat other things. And I also deal with hearing voices.</br></br>

So with this being said at first when it started it was not too bad until they closed everything. Then it turned to hell. So when you are in prison even if you are a lifer or long termer one of the three things people look forward to is groups, program (work or education), and visits. And with groups and education you can earn time off of your sentence (to go home sooner).</br></br>

So when this COVID-19 hit it stopped all of this and we couldn't even encourage our friends because we have to stay within our units. It has been months since I've seen some of my closest friends which is my support. My job as an education clerk has also stopped. And my job was one of the things that kept me going.</br></br>

But now let's talk about the visits, I personally do not receive them but I have seen my peers try and hurt themselves due to there being no visits and no movements within the prison. So speaking of mental health. Since being in this pandemic situation on the GP yard the mental health program is called CCCMS.</br></br> 

And regularly it is hard to see someone and with the pandemic for awhile it was not at all (so nothing for months). Their version of mental health is someone coming to the door and giving you a packet that has a deep breathing exercise, some coloring (so lets you hope you have things to color with and word searches).</br></br> 

And if you need to talk to someone they hardly ever come and if they do you have to talk through your cell door because you are locked in. But that is not private and it is never the same person. So for myself my mental health ended up taking a nose dive.
