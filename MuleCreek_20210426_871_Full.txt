This letter was written by an individual incarcerated at Mule Creek.</br></br>Hi PrisonPandemic,</br></br>Received the letter from the PrisonPandemic Project. I’ll try my best to tell you a story of my experience with this coronavirus which is still around. I hope you’ll be able to read and understand my story. Okay for one, I never did catch the virus thank God. We were quarantined for months at a time, no yard, no walking to the chow hall.</br></br>It was awful. They bring our food to the buildings, then three times of the week, they would come and do the swabbing of the nose, or the COVID-19 testing they call it. What I couldn’t understand was if all three buildings are on quarantine why did they move people or inmate in our case from quarantine building to the next. Me and my five other roommates never caught the virus at all.</br></br>We were the lucky ones, since the pandemic started. This quarantine had its stressed out to some inmates. I started to stress out a little. Then all of a sudden, I said to myself, “why stress out?”. I just have to do what I’m doing to stay virus free, wearing my mask and stay six feet apart. We’re starting to go out to the yard, only one building at a time. We go out for three hours a day. It feels good.</br></br>I worry now about my family in Clovis, CA. My sister, brother-in-law and my mom haven’t received their first vaccine. I worry about mom, she’s 95-years old. I’m sure they’ve got them now. Well, here’s my short story. I hope you’ll be able to read and understand my writing.</br></br>Best Wishes.</br></br>P.S. If you’re in motherhood then, Happy Mother’s Day.
