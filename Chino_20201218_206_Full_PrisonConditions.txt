This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Chino. </br></br>

Dear UC Student,</br></br>

I received your pre-written flyer last night. What this crap stories for the archives. Nobody gives a shit about what's going on inside these walls unless they're a family member.</br></br>

Yes, I got screwed around and caught COVID-19 because the correctional officer didn't have to wear masks per their union. And the first masks they did give us were rinky-dink prison-made B.S.</br></br>

What I need is to not just hide in this cell and lay down. Boo hoo. Fuck that. I need a lawyer. They need to be hit back hard. Not by archives. But byy money, pay me for the negligence, the abuse, the turmoil they're still putting me through.</br></br>

So if you want to help get me, a lawyer. Let this place bleed green!</br></br>

Happy holidays!
