How do I feel about the reduced visiting? Well, reduced implies that we get some type of visitation, which is false. We have been cut off from that comfort aspect. I understand the concern of possible spread from our families, but some safety measures can be implemented for family visiting overnight.</br></br> 

Regular visiting can be limited to ensure social distancing, for example, 50% capacity, one-hour sessions followed by 4 spots. Family visits can be approved via rapid testing prior to proceeding our visitors, as well as a limit of 2 visitors max.</br></br> 

Thatâ€™s my opinions, feelings, and views regarding this pandemic.
