Hello Prison Pandemic team. My name is (redacted). My friend, who I am incarcerated with, received a letter from you, and Rosa about the Prison Pandemic project that you guys are doing. It really piqued my interest and I'm interested in participating in your project. Can you guys please send me more info on what I need to do and what you guys are looking for? Here's a little back around about me.
<br><br> 
As I said before my name is (redacted), and I am from Santa Ana California, born and raised. I grew up with a lot of gangs, from my father and mother being involved, which influenced me and my brothers. I have four brothers, three of us have been incarcerated, two of us are currently. I am 38 years old and a father of three kids 13, nine and eight. I'm currently incarcerated for possession of a firearm and ex-felon with ammunition. I'm on my way to a new prison.  I'll be leaving in a month or so. My experience here in the county jail during this pandemic has somewhat been brutal and an eye-opener to how inhuman assistant and how people can be.

From my eyes, I've seen it like ran like a concentration camp. It brings to mind the movie Schindler's List. It's very sad but it's very true. When you first come into the jail you go to a medical booth and asked to answer all the COVID questions, if you have trouble breathing, if you have a cough, if you have a loss of taste or a fever. They take your temperature and all this being done like you already have COVID. Then when you enter the jail we are all put together in numerous cells with no 6 feet social distancing at all. Then you go into a quarantine process of 2 week supposedly, in a cell by yourself and others with a cellmate, they come and test you at least two to three times a week, then when you are cleared it's like they forget about you. I was stuck in a cell by myself for over a month after being cleared for two weeks.
<br><br> 
There are people who have been there longer. We are stuck without visits, 30 minutes out of our cells to take a shower or use to talk on a phone to our families. We have gone a year without visits, we just recently got once a month visit going on. To my understanding I donâ€™t why once a month, when all of our visits are behind a glass. Our families are worried about us as we are equally worried about them. These deputies get to go home to their families, and we don't. 
<br><br>
I understand we put ourselves in jail, but to take that privilege of seeing our families away even though they're behind a glass, it's cruel, and I would not wish that upon my worst enemy. This experience has opened my eyes to a lot of things. Especially on the emotional side. I guess I'll share more in my next letter. Anyways I hope to hear from one or more of your students and to touch bases about this letter and about this project. May your day be blessed and I hope to hear from you soon. Take care.
