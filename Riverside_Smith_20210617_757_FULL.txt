This story was told by a person incarcerated at Larry D. Smith Correctional Facility. 

UCI: So, our first question is what facility are you currently housed at?</br></br>

Caller: Riverside County Jail. I'm in the Banning Jail.</br></br>

UCI: You're at Banning?</br></br>

Caller: Banning. B-A-N-N-I-N-G.</br></br>

UCI: Okay, great. And what has the COVID situation been like at your facility? You can describe any information from the beginning of COVID or, you know, any information that relevant.</br></br>

Caller: Well, originally when we started wearing masks I was in a call with another guy that had the virus and he wouldn't wear his mask. So, I wore my mask for 24 – I only took it off to eat. And I kept telling them [unintelligible] had the virus. I haven't had it, don't want it. And I said, I'm going to take the shot. And [unintelligible] get the Johnson & Johnson shot. And I got it but I still wear my mask 24/7.</br></br>

UCI: I see.</br></br>

Caller: Anything else?</br></br>

UCI: And you said you did end up getting the virus?</br></br>

Caller: Do what?</br></br>

UCI: Did you say that you did end up – I'm sorry, let me repeat that for you. Sorry about that. You said you did end up getting the virus, correct?</br></br>

Caller: No, I shared a cell with a guy that's had the virus.</br></br>

UCI: Okay, I see.</br></br>

Caller: And he said he had it, but he doesn't have it anymore. I kept trying to get him to wear the mask because we were in the cell together. So, I told him, you know, you need to wear the mask. And he wouldn't do it, so I kept mine on 24/7 and have been that way since it started. But, I have the Johnson & Johnson shot now, so it's a lot better. You know, it's too bad you people, somebody didn't come out and interview you down here. Be a lot easier and could hear better.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, I'm so sorry about that.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, well, I figured they can't do it. But, just a suggestion, you know. It's hard to describe anything. We bunk, we eat at our bunk. We used to eat at the table, but since that virus came we have to eat at our bunk. And there's 24 guys on one side, 24 guys on the other side. And there was six, seven cases of virus in here while I was in here. And they roll them up – they call it roll up – they rolled them out to take care of the problem, I guess. And anyway, any questions that you want answered?</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, so, you mentioned that you got the Johnson & Johnson vaccine and I was just wondering what the situation at your facility has been like with the vaccinations.</br></br>

Caller: Well, right now I think everybody in the door and unit [unintelligible] one have taken the shot. They're okay.</br></br>

UCI: Oh, that's great to hear. So, it seems like most people have opted to get the vaccine?</br></br>

Caller: Right. They came in and asked everybody that didn't have the shot do they want the Johnson & Johnson, and a few people said yes. So, they got their shot and don't have to worry about anything themselves. But, I'll tell you, at one time, it was in November, there was the guard came in and he was spraying. They said, you know, I'm giving you guys cancer. Said, really. So, I wrote it all down. And then, I cut myself shaving and I'll be damned I couldn't get it to heal. And they come and told me I had – took a biopsy and said I had cancer right by my ear where I had the cut. And I got to go back and do a six hour – going to take, they said, about six hours to, you know, go in, cut some out, and then – I don't know what all they're going to do, but it's supposed to last six hours whenever they call me.</br></br>

UCI: Oh, I see. And does it seem like anyone was opposed to getting the vaccine at your facility, or did most people accept getting the vaccine and wanted to get the vaccine?</br></br>

Caller: Well, as far as I know there's nobody else in there needs the shot, they all got it.</br></br>

UCI: Okay, great.</br></br>

Caller: And I'm not the only one that wears a mask 24/7.</br></br>

UCI: Wow. How have you been coping with the crisis in your facility?</br></br>

Caller: Well, you know, I don't hang around people. Just stay away from people, don't have a huge conversation with them. And if they're not wearing their mask then, you know, I'm wearing mine. And the only time they wear their mask they come in the night, like tonight, and head count. Everybody wore their mask. They coming in before that everybody had two masks. Well, we all got two masks. And then, after that there's been the third time tonight and, you know, nobody's wearing their mask because it's late. Well, I ain't right now, I'm on the phone, but other than that, that's just how things go.</br></br>

UCI: I see. And besides, I guess, requesting that everyone wear their masks, what would have made the situation at your facility better?</br></br>

Caller: [Unintelligible]. I don't know if they wear it or not. Mine's right by my ears so every time I take my mask off I scratch myself where they did a biopsy. And I have to, well, clean it good if I'm bleeding. And of course I take a shower and I use hot water to wash that area there. And I take a shower every morning. And they try to get everybody to take a shower. There's a lot of people that don't take a shower. It's not healthy. At my age I see a lot of stuff going on, you know. Like I said, I'm 78 years old and I've seen a hell of a lot of stuff going. So, I can tell you a lot of things in here, but I'd get in trouble if I did. So, anyway, we're getting ready to have [unintelligible] call so I'm going to have to hang up here in a minute or two.</br></br>

UCI: Okay, is there anything else you want people to know about your experience before you go?</br></br>

Caller: Do what now?</br></br>

UCI: Is there anything else you want people to know about your experience before you hang up?</br></br>

Caller: No, that's about it. Like I said, I slept on a floor for three months and wore a mask, and then they transferred me to another dorm, and then they transferred me to Southwest which is down in Murrieta. It's called Southwest. And I was out there for 19 days. And they brought me back here to housing unit one which is I go to [unintelligible] and court. So, I'm hop, skip, and a jump to the courthouse. And I don't have a court date, and I haven't had a prelim and I've been there 25 months. I haven't had a prelim. And I went to go to the prelim and they continued it to September 28th. So, there I am, I'm stuck, can't do anything.</br></br>

So, anyway, I guess I'm going to have to hang up. Sorry I can't be more of a help to you. Maybe one day I can write a little letter to you guys saying thank you.</br></br>

UCI: Well, you don't have to apologize, you were plenty of help. We just want to hear your story and your experiences. And I thank you so much for participating in prison pandemic. And please consider telling your friends about us and seeing if they'd like to call.</br></br>

Caller: Well, okay, I can always call back again. But, the problem is the phone. There's a lot of people who want to use the phone. And like tonight, they turn the phone off when they do the head count, and they just turned them on. And I called my brother then I called you guys. So, anyways, that's lucky I get to use the phone if you know what I mean.</br></br>

UCI: Yes.</br></br>

Caller: So, anyway, it was nice talking to you guys and hope I helped out a little bit. Everything is okay right now. I'm surviving, that's all you can do. You know, you can't do anything else but survive. So, I wear my mask 24/7 and hopefully nobody else in here gets the virus or they bring in. The guards come, half of them wear masks, half of them don't. And I think they're the one that's bringing the virus in, to be honest with you. But anyway, it was nice talking to you. And I got to hang up now.</br></br>

UCI: Yes, you as well. And please stay safe.</br></br>

Caller: Thank you.</br></br>

UCI: Okay, bye-bye.</br></br>

Caller: Okay, bye.</br></br>
