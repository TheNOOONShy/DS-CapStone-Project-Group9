Hello there PrisonPandemic,</br></br>

It’s getting back at you after receiving a unexpected letter from very understandable ladies. As you ask, referring to your letter, how it’s been going with the pandemic referring to COVID-19. The first two months as in February it was kind of shaky, cause we all inmates didn’t realize it was that contagious.</br></br>

After seeing the deaths have risen in the hundreds to thousands on the news in different states, wow. I’m just glad this prison did the best to the fastest way to get everyone vaccinated when they stopped the transfers to visits as I see it. Instead of expanding it, they accomplished it.</br></br>

Well ladies I’ll let you go. Expressed it the best way I can and know.</br></br>

Sincerely.
