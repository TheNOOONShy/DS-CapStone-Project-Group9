This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Donovan.</br></br>Dear PrisonPandemic,</br></br>So, I received your letter asking me about how it was in here with COVID going around. Well, this is how it was for me.</br></br>July 7th, 2020 - So, I was in Theo Lacy County Jail in Orange County. It was so packed with people that it was only a matter of time before people started getting sick. There wasn't any order going on. The sick was mixed with the healthy.</br></br>September 2020 - I was transferred to Delano State Prison. We went through 21 days of quarantine in a cell by ourselves. Then they gave some people three months off for COVID credits. I didn't get them.</br></br>Once I got here to Donovan, I was on another 21-day quarantine then I was housed with everyone else, and the worst happened, I caught COVID. I was sick for 10 days; it was so scary. I thought I was going to die; I didn't thank God.</br></br>Know now I have been fully vaccinated with Pfizer. Please write me back so I know you enjoyed my letter.</br></br>Sincerely.
