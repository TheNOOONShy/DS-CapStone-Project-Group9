This story was told by a person incarcerated at New Folsom.</br></br>

UCI: What has the COVID situation been like at your facility?</br></br>

Caller: Terrible. We're on lockdown right now.</br></br>

UCI: On lockdown. So, do they have all the prisoners just staying in their cells?</br></br>

Caller: Say that one more time.</br></br>

UCI: So, do they just have the prisoners staying in their cells for most of the day? Or how is a typical day on lockdown?</br></br>

Caller: I can't -</br></br>

UCI: Hello?</br></br> 

Caller: Hello? I can't understand, you're going too fast.</br></br>

UCI: Oh, I was just asking how a typical day is on lockdown for you guys.</br></br>

Caller: Very terrible. This is our third lockdown. Apparently, staff are bringing it in to us 'cause majority of the inmates here were vaccinated. Majority of us actually took the vaccine, whether it was Pfizer or Johnson & Johnson, you know, we pretty much all took it.</br></br>

But staff members are not, it's not a mandatory thing for staff to get vaccinated. So that's an issue right now, but they're still allowed to come in and be around us unvaccinated. Which puts us at risk right now.</br></br> 

UCI: Oh wow, okay. Well, how has the COVID situation at your facility affected your loved ones?</br></br>

Caller: Well, they like to hear from me a lot. I don't have, you know, too many family members, you know. I do have a sister and a mother right now and a father, but he's sick right now. He's recovering from COVID.</br></br>

So you know, they want to talk to me as much as possible because you never know, you know, anything can happen in here. I can catch COVID, you know, even though I'm vaccinated. But, you know, it doesn't say that I still can't catch it. Just because you're vaccinated doesn't mean you still can't catch it.</br></br>

And you know, I have asthma, so I don't know how that may, you know, affect me, so my family knows about it. So, they're very worried, you know, it's kind of, it's an uproar going on right now 'cause people on the outside, advocates.</br></br>

The advocates for prisoners are, you know, very angry because this is our third lockdown because of a COVID situation. You know, basically putting our health at risk. So, yeah, it's affecting a lot of people 'cause, you know, a lot of people, you know, it's like damn, this is the third time?</br></br>

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: When are they going to do something to, you know, safeguard us? So that's what's going on right now.</br></br>

UCI: Well, I would just like to get your reaction to this. I don't know if you heard CDCR announced on January 6th that all in-person visitations will be shut down. What do you think about that?</br></br>

Caller: Are nine prisons going to be shut down?</br></br>

UCI: No, in-person visitations, so you being able to go see your family. Those are officially shut down across all the prisons and jails in California. What do you think about that?</br></br>

Caller: They did that when COVID first hit. And this is what don't make sense, this is why I'm an in-prison advocate for myself, or I advocate the population that I am currently in, and that kind of puts me in a fucked up position.</br></br> 

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: Because I get targeted by the correctional officers so when it came to visiting, this is what didn't make sense. They took our visits because of COVID, saying we might catch COVID from our family members, friends, or whoever comes visit us. But yet, they're allowing staff members to come around us and handle our food, escort us to here and there. That didn't make sense. You know what I am saying?</br></br>

UCI: Yeah. It doesn't.</br></br>

Caller: How can you - exactly. So now, you know, there is another uproar about that, and we're in talks about doing a hunger strike so we can - so we can make statewide attention. Hopefully, the news or something, you know, Sacramento can understand. I don't even think Sacramento knows what's going on.</br></br>

Sometimes this prison don't report shit. They like to keep things under wraps and keep it isolated. But we're thinking about a hunger strike so we can, you know, get it on the news, get, you know, statewide attention of what's going on here because it's just not making sense on what's going on. I mean, it's like we're being treated as subhuman or something like -</br></br> 

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: It is crazy, yeah. So yeah, the visits, you know, they, you know, anything that they can take from us or any reason, you know, it's less work for them. You know, that's less work, take the visits, put us on lockdown, no program, you know, any excuse - any excuse to take anything. But yet, they are allowing staff members to handle our food, and they are not vaccinated.</br></br>

They're, you know, they come in every time a COVID outbreak happens. A staff member brung it in. A staff member it came from a staff member. We are on lockdown right now.</br></br> 

It came from a staff member. But yet, we can't see our family members at visits. We can't kiss our family members even if we have a mask on.</br></br>
 
We have to sit across the table from each other, but yet correctional officers come in here with this shit, handle our food, escort us from here and there, putting their hand on us to escort us, and you know, grab our arm. I mean, it doesn’t make sense.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, it doesn't.</br></br>

Caller: I'm kind of really fed up right now!</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, it doesn't. It seems like you guys have to suffer for something that is out of your control. And you guys can't really do anything about it.</br></br> 

Caller: Exactly.</br></br> 

UCI: How many people - how many people do you have with you in terms of the strike, the hunger strike? Do you have a lot of prisoners on board?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah. We have two buildings right now. I'm in one building that houses 100 people, it's two tiers. It's 50 on the bottom, 50 on the top. It's another building right next to us, the same thing 50 on the bottom 50 on the top. So it's a total of 200. We are currently housed in a TSU setting which is a psychiatric services unit.</br></br>

We're basically housed here for guys who's in the mental health program. Yeah, so are you familiar with the Coleman administration? Coleman v. Newsom.</br></br>

UCI: No.</br></br>

Caller: They're basically a class of federal lawyers who basically supervising and keep watch over CDCR on how they handle mental health patients. We're considered mental health patients, so we're under a different statute of law in CDCR. It was so much corruption regarding EOP inmates.</br></br>

That Coleman, a group of lawyers called Coleman in, located in Sac, I mean not in Sacramento, but in San Francisco, sued CDCR, sued the state, and forced CDCR to come up with a plan to specifically and specially house us and train officers on how to deal with us. It was so much corruption. I'm talking about, you know, they used to spray us in the face with the pepper spray, beat us with the batons.</br></br>

It was so bad that a federal judge, they showed us, they showed a federal judge a video of a, some criminal misconduct, a beating of an EOP inmate. The federal judge couldn't even watch the end of the tape. She told them to turn it off and made the ruling right then and there. It was so bad.</br></br>

UCI: Wow.</br></br>

Caller: It was so bad. Yeah, it's - it's, so the fact that we even in a mental health program is more serious than the general population. We are not considered general population. We are under a different umbrella, you feel me?</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, I get it. I get that prisoners are, if you're a prisoner or an incarcerated person in general, they automatically put you under a certain umbrella. And it sounds like with your building. They put you even lower than the normal prisoners themselves.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, exactly, exactly.</br></br> 

UCI: Wow.</br></br>

Caller: This is more serious than just the average case. The fact that we're under a federal receivership called Coleman v. Newsom, so you know, it's - it's wild shit going on around here. Yeah, you know, it's - it's an everyday struggle.</br></br>

UCI: How? I want to know how do you cope with all this during the pandemic?</br></br>

Caller: I write music, I write lyrics, I write songs, I write poetry. You know, I'm trying to get in contact. I'm trying to find a pen pal program so I can write to different people in certain areas because a lot of people are curious about prison, so I like to write people who is curious about prison.</br></br>

So I can give them kind of a perspective/outlook on prison life. 'Cause they don't allow volunteers to come in this prison and level four, maybe on a lower, the lower level prisons like level one and two or San Quentin. Have you ever heard of San Quentin?</br></br>

UCI: Never. What is that?</br></br>

Caller: San Quentin is located in the Bay Area. They have a lot of programs there. You know, they allow people from the outside. You can sign up to get a walk-through of the prison chaperoned.</br></br> 

You can walk through the prison and talk to inmates and walk around the prison and see how it looks. They don't do that here. This is a level four prison, so they don't that here they don't allow volunteers to walk through here.</br></br>

So, my goal is to find pen pals and give them - my goal is to find a lot of pen pals and let them know what goes on in prison. Because these stories are never really told really. You know what I am saying?</br></br> 

They don't tell, you know, if you hear if you're watching Fox News and you hear there was a murder of an inmate, 'cause someone just got killed the other day. He was found dead in his cell just the other day.</br></br>

UCI: Wow.</br></br>

Caller: Last week. Right, it was on the news, but they didn't say much about it. They didn't say it was only like a flash, you know, it was like a flash. They just spoke about it real quick, and that was that.</br></br>

They don't know what circumstances behind it. They don't know if a corrupt cops was behind it. You know, no one gets the inside scoop of  things. So the fact I'm in here, so I know prison like I know the Bible, front to back.</br></br> 

So no one really gets the real scoop, the reality of what really goes on in prison until someone from the inside tells them because I'm actually here. So I'm trying to get a lot of pen pals. Correspond with a lot pen pals, especially those that's a part of organizations, especially those that's a part of organizations so that they can get the real on everything so they can maybe write to newspapers, contact news outlets, and things like that. So the real news can be spread.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, I was going to let you know there is actually a pen pal project. UCLA School of Law is having a pen pal project where they are seeking out pen pals that live inside CDCR facilities, so if you want, you can ask for that information and ask for the address from the UCLA’s School of Law, and they'll match you with a pen pal. It's a project going got right now.</br></br>

Caller: Can I get that information from you tomorrow? Can I get that information from you next week?</br></br>

UCI: I could, I don’t know how they go about doing it but you could just, let's see, I would give you the address, do you have, but you don't have anything to write down with, huh?
