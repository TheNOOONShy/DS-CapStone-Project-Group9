PrisonPandemic,</br></br>
I am in Folsom State Prison. I am a recipient of your letter. I was very glad to hear from your Pandemic Team. I have been incarcerated for 23 years. And I’ve never had to endure such a situation as this pandemic. I must say, I still believe that this Pandemic has something to do with bible prophecy. Because, the way that it all jumped off. Most believed that it originated from China. But, from what evidence has proven, that isn’t the case.</br></br>
 As the COVID-19 proliferated across the globe. Spewing it’s venom on all unsuspecting individuals. I watched in silence, as hospitals filled with patients across America and even in California. I often wondered what has mankind done to cause such a terrible thing to befall them. And, to be living in such a time as this. In some ways it had me levitating in scripturer. Because, I wanted as many others to find some sort of answer to this problem.</br></br>
 Now, I can quote a few scripture as in the book of exodus. When God instructed pharaoh to free the children of Israel. And, the fact that, he decided to ignore God’s command. Thus, many plagues befell him and his people. Okay, The pandemic today, I feel, has come to us to steer us closer to our maker. The true king of ephemeral and eternal realm, who is, God almighty, The Father of our Lord & Savior Jesus Christ. I’ve been waiting to tell someone this. Because, this is what has gotten me through this time of uncertainty.</br></br>
You know I have family members on the street. Who have been protected by the awesome hand of God. And his love and grace has also kept me. I’ve seen and heard about a few people that have contracted the virus. And, it’s not a pretty sight. It’s truly nothing one can do once they’ve been infected by such a disease. The vaccinations are another thing. They’re saying everyone should be and could be vaccinated.</br></br>
I know, the media does not publish every source of information that they may come across. So, the blood clots they speak of pertaining to the vaccinations I say, who knows what may be ahead though? Because, there was really never any test phase. It just came straight from production to patients. There was supposed to be an in between period.</br></br>
To run the proper tests to gauge and better understand the medications that would provide. That never happened though. So, these health risks to be vaccinated is another slippery slope. With these things in place, I had to think about [redacted]. I had to find out what is best for [redacted]?</br></br>
Because in prison,  the best scenario for me was to stay quarantined in a cell by myself, to insure that I could beat this thing. For this is a very very serious time in American history. There has never been such a heat wave as COVID-19. And, there is always going to be people out there with COVID-19. So, where do we go from here? The way it’s looking is, COVID-19 may cause mankind to become separatists to a degree. We’ll see the COVID vaccinations are going great in the prison. They’ve done a good job at keeping the inmate population from getting totally infected. Although, there were some cases on both sides.</br></br>
It was never able to get a foothold Because of the fast actions of the uppers running the prison. Now, in the ongoing part of this, I'm still pushing to free myself so I can get back into the streets and have a good life. I’m seeking out a good civil attorney to assist me in the endeavor. For, there is truly a lot to live for, even though COVID-19 is on site. One must remain optimistic as to the future. In seeking one day, to be truly happy again. In the land of the free and home of the brave. And, if you keep your mind right, God can help you! Thank you for this opportunity and God Bless!</br></br>
Yours truly,
