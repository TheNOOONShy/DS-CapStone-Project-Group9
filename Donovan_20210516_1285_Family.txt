That made me more depressed and sad. That’s my mental problem, but not having visits didn’t bother me much. I haven’t had one the 25 years that I have been in prison. The last person on earth that cared about me my father passed away Feb 2019. So I’ve gotten used to no letters from home and he lived back east and couldn’t afford to come see me. It has been hard on those that do have loved ones.</br></br>
