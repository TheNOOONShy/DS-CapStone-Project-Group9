This story was told by a person incarcerated at Donovan.</br></br>

Caller: Okay. Well, actually, I've been taking it very hard. Because, prior to COVID-19, I had a - well, I still have my job. But I'm not really going in like I used to. I work as a clerk in the education department. And I also tutor a lot of the students. And I was attending college in the evenings. And I was attending Playwrights, meditation class.</br></br>So, now, instead of going to all my programs, now, I'm just stuck in the dayroom with many other individuals that just scream all day across the tier so that I can't even do my college work. And there's barely any room to even exercise. So it's been very, very, very hard to adjust to the COVID-19 in this environment.
