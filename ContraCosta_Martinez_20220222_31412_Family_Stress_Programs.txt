UCI: How the COVID situation at your facility affected your loved ones?</br></br>

Caller: It’s kind of affected them pretty hard. I haven’t even seen my son. I have a one-year-old son. I haven’t even seen my son in about a month or so because of COVID reasons.</br><br>

I don’t know if this is true, but there was a person on the module who got COVID, and he was one of the first people to get it. He said he got it through the visiting. We’ve got glass visitation with these little holes at the bottom. He said he probably got it through those visitor holes.</br></br>

And my family hasn’t wanted to come up here because they feel like they’re not properly getting protected. Like, they don’t clean the visiting rooms, or anything like that. And before that before they opened the in-person visits, we had Zoom visits. But the Zoom visits were only for 10 minutes.</br></br> 

We only got to visit our family for 10 minutes every two weeks. So it wasn’t even like you really got to see them or even enough time to talk to them and check on them to see how they’re doing.</br></br>

UCI: What has it been like for you to have reduced visitation and programming?</br></br>

Caller: It’s actually pretty hard being in the county jail. Twenty one hours locked down and three hours of free-time. It’s actually my first time ever being in trouble in my whole entire life. So it’s kind of – it’s been pretty hard because I’m family-oriented and I’m a first-time father.</br></br> 

I only got to spend five days with my son so not being able to see him and hold him and spend time with him and not being really able to communicate with my loved ones just ‘cause due to COVID reasons is pretty hard. It’s pretty stressful. It’s pretty depressing.
