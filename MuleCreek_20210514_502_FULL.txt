This story was told by a person incarcerated at Mule Creek.</br></br>

Caller: Mhm, gotcha. And so, are you going to be asking questions or you want me to just go ahead and say whatever, like?</br></br>

UCI: You, you can go ahead and anything you wanna share. I mean, if you prefer, I can also ask you questions, but it’s better if you just share anything you’d like to say.</br></br>

Caller: Well, well the pandemic, it definitely changed the whole, man, the whole setting in prisons. This is something I’ve never saw before but I been down for nine years. But I seen many people, lot of fights broke out, lots of arguments both from people who’s not wearing a mask and people wearing a mask. Especially at the political moment, like a year ago with the election, upcoming election, you know, like… Wow, I’m a little nervous for some reason.</br></br>

But yeah, I wasn’t able to see my family, my family couldn’t ever come see me at least. My girl, she wasn’t able to come see me. Although she lives in Massachusetts, like she comes out once in a while. But it’s different and it’s takes out of our comfort zone. Like those guys, I been living in my cell for two years with good cellies when this pandemic hit, they kept moving us around to different pods, different cells, different buildings, to different yards and I’ve been in cells with people I don’t know.</br></br>

People were like mentally ill too in my cell, they have us mixed up with those guys. It was uncomfortable but… And experiencing the symptoms, like the heavy breathing and headache and all that with no one to turn to to help or anything like that. It sucked, you know.</br></br>

Plus, I want to, it feels good to talk to my family, you know, but I wasn’t allowed to use the phone, we wasn’t allowed to use the phone, we wasn’t even allowed to leave the cell. So, like, it sucked, you’re just stuck in the cell. Pretty much you’re in the hole. I wasn’t able to write, yeah it was tough.</br></br>

And I’m a student too, I’ve been taking courses, many courses. And at that time, I was a little far behind. I didn’t have much energy to do anything. And they wouldn’t even give us showers every day. They would give us showers like every two or three days. I thought that was important to keep our hygienes clean, like to stay clean but apparently not, at least not in here in CDCR.</br></br>

But all I get is a birdbath, meaning like get a bucket of water, fill it up from the sink, pour a cup over myself over the toilet of course with a privacy curtain because I have five cellies. In this yard, in the yard I’m in, it’s six-man cells. So yeah it’s totally something I’ve never experienced, something I’d never thought I’d see.</br></br>

I had OG cellies that’d been down for three decades, 40 years, and they would explain like, they would express how much this is something that they’d never experienced before. It was crazy how one building, how they flipped, they told everybody in my building to pack up because we’re moving to another yard to one building was [unintelligible].</br></br>

And we all packed and migrated. See we were just walking in straight lines along, about, a long walk to another yard and in line, carrying our stuff. It just felt like a migration, literally, wearing our masks, the staff are wearing their little suit, and it was crazy.</br></br>

But yeah and then there’s a lot of, I see friends breaking up, friends, like, the friendship falters and collapse because of the mask. And at the same time, as I mentioned earlier about the election, the Donald Trump with the mask thing and, and the Biden, all that played a role in it too with the pandemic. And it was crazy. I seen a lot of fights broke out, I seen COs get in fights with inmates and COs amongst each other as well you know. It was crazy.</br></br>

UCI: What facility are you currently housed at?</br></br>

Caller: I’m in FSCO yard, E facility in Mule Creek State Prison, well, yeah Mule Creek State Prison. I’m level two, it’s a level two yard.</br></br>

UCI: How has the vaccination situation been like at your facility?</br></br>

Caller: Oh man, we barely got vaccinated about a month ago, about a month and a half ago. They always tell us, like “You’ll get your vaccination soon,” for quite some time. And I always thought, if I understand from the news, prisons are, they’re like a priority. It didn’t seem that way. And I mean I’m not sure if that’s true if I interpreted it from the news.</br></br>

But yeah, it didn’t seem that way and it just, we all wanted the vaccination. We wanted to see something because with no the vaccination we weren’t even allowed to do, we were limited to doing, we weren’t allowed to do anything. Come out, use the phone, shower as much as we want, we’re just stuck in a cell.</br></br>

In here, we at least get the privilege to choose your celly, but here, they just always throw whoever in your cell and you’re stuck with that guy, those people despite differences or being incompatible with them. Like, not able to live comfortable, you know. But yeah, the vaccination was, it was, it came loose, it came late. They’re still doing it right now, they’re still trying to finish everyone else in here. I got mine about a month ago.</br></br>

UCI: How have you been coping with the crisis?</br></br>

Caller: How long have I been coping with this?</br></br>

UCI: How have you been coping with everything going on?</br></br>

Caller: Well, my girl definitely, she writes me. JPay allows, JPay is the organization that allows loved ones, people out there to email loved ones behind bars to stay connected through this pandemic. So, she was able to email me more often and she was just giving me emotional support. Man, I gotta give it to her, she was there for me since day one. That and reading, just doing my studies. That’s how I get through it, you know, stay busy.</br></br>

UCI: What do you think would’ve made the situation at your facility better?</br></br>

Caller: I think if they were to have a plan from the, it don’t seem like they had a plan from the gate or a contingency plan. It just seemed like wherever a guy tested positive they just threw him to another building, speaking like it was gonna serve him better but it affects the next cell.</br></br>

Well, what they should’ve done is once an inmate tested positive, just like quarantine him in that cell with his cellies instead of moving him to another building or another pod when his old cellies that he was living in could’ve caught it and shared it with other people on the yard or in the building.</br></br>

So, they were kind of backward. I didn’t understand, I didn’t understand what they were doing. Everybody said it was, like, I don’t know, a conspiracy, things going on, whatever it could be but they handled it very poorly.</br></br>

UCI: What else do you want people to know?</br></br>

Caller: [unintelligible] …at that point. San Quentin, my cousin died from COVID. He only had one year to do. He went to San Quentin serving one year and he got COVID and he died. He was there for a nonviolent, you know…</br></br>

UCI: Wow.</br></br>

Caller: He was a nonviolent offender. And then, so it not only impacted me and him, of course, but my family as well, you know, because… I’m sorry, what was your question? I didn’t mean to interrupt.</br></br>

UCI: If there’s anything else that you’d like to share, anything else that you want people to know about your experience.</br></br>

Caller: Sorry, would you repeat that question or just something I want people to know about my experiences?</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, anything else that you’d like to share.</br></br>

Caller: It’s, it’s for sure an experience I never had before. Overall, you know, we prevailed in here. Yeah, we lost, I lost some friends over this stupid, this pandemic thing. I seen a lot of people fight and get beat up. It wasn’t cool, it was a rough experience.</br></br>

But for sure, man, my girl, man, she was there from the day one. I mean, she’s always been there for me but she’s always kept me positive. So, is this gonna be recorded on the website or just gonna write it down briefly on the website?</br></br>

UCI: Yeah so then afterwards it’s gonna be edited and then it’s, all your information, without your name and everything, your story that you said today is gonna be posted on the website so everyone can read it.</br></br>

Caller: I don’t mind sharing my name at all.</br></br>

UCI: We’re not allowed to, so even if you were to, it would just be edited out for safety reasons and everything.</br></br>

Caller: Okay because I was just talking to my girl right? And she was like “oh man give me a shoutout.” I’m like alright, I’m like I didn’t know because on the paper it did mention being anonymous.</br></br>

UCI: You’re always free as well, if you don’t call, you can always write in. You can always send drawings and everything as well. So if there’s anything you forgot today, anything additional you want to share. I’m not sure if her name would go through, but you can, anything you’d like to share, you can also write us and that will also be posted.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah gotcha, see I thought about writing but that’s like, time, I mean a lot of people think we have nothing but time in here but, like, man I stay busy. I’m in school, I work, I’m a representative for Hispanics so I address issues and this and that. So, I’m awfully busy so when you provide a number, I’m like that’s something I could do for sure.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, and then if your friends would like to call in in any language or if they would like to write in any language, I’m sure we can find someone as well. Thank you so much for participating in PrisonPandemic. Feel free to call back any time. Thank you so much.</br></br>

Caller: Thank you. Hey, if you can, would you mention how important it is to have loved ones stay connected? That does help a lot while you’re going through this experience.</br></br>

UCI: Yes.</br></br>

Caller: Just having that experience, like keeping in touch with the loved ones, that’s all that matters. I always worry about my family out there as well, not only for them to worry about me and it was hard.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, I completely understand.</br></br>

Caller: Alright, you have a good day.</br></br>

UCI: Thank you, you too.</br></br>

Caller: Alright, bye-bye.
