January twenty twenty one, here I was minding my own business nothing out of the ordinary except the whole world turned upside down because of this deadly virus, news flash people dying everywhere, Trump did not get re-elected, and somehow someway I was infected with this virus. The only people I was coming into contact with was medical staff every morning . . . </br></br>

I take medication, a drug addiction treatment, really good stuff if you ask me . . wink . .  wink . . anyway there is no other way I could of gotten it . . at first I thought that it was the common cold . . I was feverish, and I was aching from head to feet but then I got tested, and sure enough I came back positive for COVID.</br></br>

At that time I had already heavy doubts . . all because my breathing my inhale and exhale was different, I felt like not enough oxygen was goin' into my lungs, no matter how heavy I would inhale it just wasn’t enough. I was out of breath so I started to think that I might have been exposed to COVID-19 . . once it was confirmed and reality hit me like ton of brick, I realized that things can get worst and I might D.I.E . .</br></br>

I whispered a small prayer, gave thanks to my heavenly father for all the blessings, for all the good life, for everything good that was ever given to me. Material wealth & all . . I actually also thank him for the bad stuff as well, for all that was bad I have certainly learned from.</br></br>

After praying and knowing I had that ugly virus I just sat at my bunk, mattress rolled up day after day really thinking that I was going to die . . as it turns out, well I have good genes . .  I started to feel better, I had gotten depressed, not going to lie about that . . physically, mentally and spiritually. I overcame that ugly and hostile virus and depression here I am un-dead . . . </br></br>

I have be through some crazy stuff, seen crazy stuff and I know stuff . . and because of that . . it’s no conscious   . . everything happens for reasons beyond out control, I was told . . but . . knowing that I know . . I might have been targeted. But like I said . . I have good genes, and thick skin. Every day is a brand new opportunity for wisdom, knowledge and understanding.</br></br>
