This story was told by a person incarcerated at Donovan.</br></br>Caller: Man, I, I spent a lot of time playing guitar, wrote songs that I didn't think I could write. And, you know, it's music really helped me a lot. I spent so many months, well every month playing and writing music and it definitely opened doors in my mind that were shut before. I didn't, you know, I believe in myself more now. I know that, that I'm a good songwriter now. And it just my guitar level went up. And it was definitely something that helped me get by andhelped a lot of the guys in here too, that were in my building. You know, they had instruments and we'd share songs with each other and stuff. And it was something that really helped a lot of people out.</br></br>Caller: I needed a little bit more than faith, because faith was failing me. And music was able to do that for me when I didn't have anything else. Not even faith. You know, music was there every time. So, Music Man, it really, really, really helped me out during this time.</br></br>UCI: That's amazing. Yeah. Let me see. And so, is there anything? What else? Is there anything else you want people to know about your experience?</br></br>Caller: Well, my experience with this is I, I feel like there needs to be more preparation for situations like this and CDC because we're kind of just shut down and and things weren't being handled the way that they should be, or the way that people were probably thinking they were being handled. There's, there's no, there's got to be better ways to deal with these situations if they should ever occur again. I mean, we're still living through it right now. But there's, there's just got to be a better way to.</br></br>Caller: It’s very hard for people in certain areas. I mean, I've, I've had good coping skills, but I feel bad for the guys that that can get through this, you know, it's really hard on people. And there has to be something done about it. Guys are just trying to take their lives and some of them succeeded at it, you know, and people need, need, need help in here?</br></br>
