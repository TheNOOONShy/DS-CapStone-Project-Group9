Hello PrisonPandemic,</br></br>

Hi, it's nice to see people care. Well we are tested every four days, if you become positive with COVID they move you to the quarantine building. We had no visit for a year until last month. They kept us lockdown for four to six months because we had a huge surge in here with 1,607 inmate and staff got ill.</br></br>

They still gave us showers, phone calls. Instead of us going to yard where our inmate store is at, we had it delivered to the building. Also there are food package vendors and that was delivered also. Normally everyone have program together. Now each of the five building get three hours of yard a day in rotation. They minimize the amount of people in our dayroom.</br></br>

Before the vaccine came out I would worry about my older parents with underline medical issues. I don't really have anyone to write so this is cool. Anyway I could keep you as a penpal? Let me know. Now that we are all getting vaccination I feel safer but still have it in the back of my mine that the variants could cause us harm and another outbreak.</br></br>

Well I got to go for now.
