This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Chowchilla.</br></br>

I have had the COVID-19 going on 3 separate times. The first was Nov of 2019, second Dec 26-2020 and (just this a.m.) my sense of smell/taste has left me again.</br></br> 
 
These are propagated informational news being provided by the CDCR/CCWF regarding the exposure, guidelines, staff administrating news (promptly) cleaning supplies being provided, vitals being examined correctly before/after COVID-19. Transferring inmates during pandemic.</br></br> 
 
Exposure has been real at CCWF – based on CCWF administration not sticking to daily – early morning entrances being screened for high temps etc. When it began in March 17 here at CCWF – The entrance was stationed w/ temperature takes – this lasted 1 month. And disappeared. Then officers began not wearing their masks at all – coming to work wearing the fabric – alligators. Gators! Or not at all.</br></br> 

Guidelines were present and ignored while inmate population was doomed from the beginning – inmates were given cloth made face masks (fun within) these prison walls? Made out of regular pants materials of non-approved quality from anywhere? Issued 3 at a time with no possible ways to thoroughly clean them after use? Issued 9 total from March 17 to Dec 1. Ten months later when the 2 officers 1 nurse 1 correctional officer passed it to inmates within a 10 day period – (once) 700 inmates had caught it w/ bogus facial masks – and passed it (m/o) all the others they socialized with?</br></br>

Contracted COVID-19 inmates were relocated in all types of weather conditions with all of their belongings and were told DON'T PACK you’ll only be there for a couple days – you’ll came back to your own room – once cleaned. NOT. Inmates that left first listened to C.O’s say – and had ALL of their everything destroyed. Trashed, discarded into trash bins – without documentation of the discarded items. So COVID-19 inmates are totally exposed and some don’t have family to replace their necessities!</br></br>
