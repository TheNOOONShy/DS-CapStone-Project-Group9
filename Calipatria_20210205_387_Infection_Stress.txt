This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Calipatria.</br></br>

We are forced to be close to one another in cells/ dorms, and outdoor/ yard areas. Due to the dense population and proximity, COVID-19 can spread rapidly throughout the prison.</br></br>

I fear COVID-19 spreading by correctional officers, mental health providers, and medical staff consistently coming in and out of the prison. Presenting a high risk of infection for all of us incarcerated. I fear for my safety and well-being on a daily basis. Those who get COVID-19 are being sent to an ad seg unit and do not receive the medical treatment needed to fight, recover, or stop the spread of this deadly virus within the prison. The stress and fear come from not knowing if I will see my loved ones ever again.
