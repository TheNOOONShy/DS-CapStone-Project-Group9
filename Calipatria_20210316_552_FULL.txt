This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Calipatria.</br></br>Hello PrisonPandemic,</br></br>Thank you for taking the time out of your day to write to me concerning your intent to hear from prisoners, the experiences with COVID.</br></br>Well, I would be more than willing to share this story and any other, but this caught me a little off guard. Allow me to explain, it is not common for a person in my circumstance to receive mail from a stranger, and although your enclosed inquiry is appropriate and clearly intended for its purpose of what you are to achieve. This is perplexing me.</br></br>I guess my mistrust is unfairly questioning all of this. I am a man on a journey. My journey of self-discovery for the person I was born to be and rehabilitate myself from the man I allowed myself to become because I was scared, felt alone, unworthy, vulnerable to perpetual victimization.</br></br>And so, I built an alter ego to protect my innocence, un or subconsciously. Filled myself with cognitive fallacies and distortions that suppressed my humanity, empathy, compassion, care, trust, fears, etc., and allowed me to ignore the pain, hurt, chaos, victims, destruction, lies, deceit, etc.</br></br>The thing here is, I am willing to participate just because it is the right thing to do. I want nothing, but I am a social being. It is hard for me to open up to an unknown. Now, it is not a petition to anything beyond the scope of this project.</br></br>It is weird, the timing of this, your letter, because I am currently in a similar situation with someone who found me out of nowhere. She lives in Northern California, but somehow found out about my art. I believe in God and Jesus Christ as my lord and savior, so I follow his direction.</br></br>There are no coincidences in my life. I’ve been going on a continual communication with this person about COVID, life stories, and art, prison art. To now have a petition from you all at UCI (University of California Irvine, is it?) on similar grounds is amazing to me.</br></br>When I received your letter, I had just finished working out and was about to start on my college work. I’m enrolled in college. Mathematical statistics (intro), love it. Interesting stuff.</br></br>I’m one of the lucky few (blessed, really) to have the ability to leave the cell because I was granted the opportunity to draw a mural of 680 ft. squared on the yard's gym wall. So, I get to go out about four and a half days out of the week to paint.</br></br>It’s an experience, since I had never picked up a paint brush before but am very confident on the talent’s God has put in me. The faculty captain granted me pretty much total freedom over this project. None of this is common to prisoners.</br></br>They allowed me artistic freedom, pick who I wanted to help me with the project (only two of the five remain, they (three) were let go to protect the integrity of the project), work hours, an amazing amount of supplies with paint. In short, it is something we are privileged to do because we are being allowed to live out our potential.</br></br>For us, it is not about leaving the cell (after your initial year or two, you adapt your entire life to cell, everything essential to us is in here. A cell that’s about 6’x12’, but the actual space we have to move about in is about 2.5 feet wide by 10 or 9 feet long without running into a locker, bunk, desk, toilet, or wall), it is the opportunity to do something productive and worthy of admiration, praise, community, rehabilitation.</br></br>The entire thing of how all this happened is a story in itself, right as the pandemic was coming out of Wuhan, China. Truth is every day is a story in my life. No day is uneventful. Just as I am here, right now in this moment with you, I am always an open book.</br></br>Things under this pandemic are far worse for some of my peers here, or people out there. I can’t give you horror stories, unless it is a horror story. But I’m a go getter, happy-go-lucky, worries don’t benefit me or those around me. I just go. None of this is difficult to me.</br></br>It is sad to admit, but I’ve endured far worse than this. As a prisoner, I am taken care of by a system that creates and foments institutional dependency: three meals, clean water, hot water to shower in, a fully functioning toilet, electricity, health-dental-mental services, clean clothing, shoes/leather boots, a safe place to sleep in, blanket, sheets, soap, and all at no economic burden to me.</br></br>Before surrendering myself to customs/border patrol at Calexico, Mexicali border check point, I was a fugitive for six years in Mexico, running from my responsibility in the murder of an Iraqi veteran on a two week leave and the attempted murder of his younger brother, his pregnant wife, and unborn daughter. All of whom were shot. Tragic. Shameful. Senseless.</br></br>

Even though I was not the one to shoot the weapon that caused so much grief, pain, loss, and destruction in so many lived beyond that tragic moment, I knew what was happening. Prison didn’t hinder my criminality in any way. It may hinder some, but not people like me in those moments of my life.</br></br>It is dangerous when anyone believes whole heartedly that no one cares about them or what becomes of them. Then there was a confusion in me on what love looked like, felt like, sounded like, smelled like, and tasted like. For the greater part of my life, I believed love was synonymous of respect because I lost my mother at 25 months of age.</br></br>She died in a car accident in Mexico. We (my siblings and I) were never taken to her funeral, burial, or grave until- well, for me, I was 13 years old in Mexico. My father raised me. A good man, but very irresponsible. He was a drug trafficker and never protected me from the criminality.</br></br>On the contrary, I helped him in mostly everything he did. It was in these moments that I, as a child, wanting to be loved, to bond, to create affection through love, learned how these drug traffickers showed, demonstrated, and acknowledged love. Through respect.</br></br>To cut this short, sorry but I still got to do statistics. The first time I was sent to an institution for criminal deviant behavior, respect was automatic. To me, that was being loved automatically, instantly. For doing nothing other than showing up to juvenile hall at the age of 13.</br></br>So back in a hot August night at the Mexico-U.S. border, the thought of a life sentence in prison didn’t bother me as much as me running from what I consciously chose to participate in. Because I always instantly loved in these places.</br></br>It was not until being sent to Pelican Bay State Prison and going to Ad-Seg for disassociating myself from my gang life that I studied the word of God and realized what love was. And this conquering of all the lies I convinced myself to believe began.</br></br>Whoever it may concern, UCI, etc., as you can see, notice, I am a writer, an artist, storyteller, and would be honored to share me, my story, my experiences, with you or everyone. This is not a problem to me. My biggest problem right now is not having enough hours in a day.</br></br>The resources I have are for things like this, it is not an issue to me to use them as long as they are being used for service of others. Positive impact of others, or some productive empowerment of others or myself. I can go on and on, sorry but I have to end this.</br></br>Thank you for your invite to participate in your project. But I have some childhood traumas that still nudge at me where I feel unnoticed, invisible, and that feeling sucks. And I know this may or is selfish, but is this like a one-time thing, a continuing thing, and experiment, observational study?</br></br>Recognition is not what is important to me and not what I am wondering about. Just want to know the interpersonal context because what I care about is you, or all of you in this project, as people. It is understandable to me that there has to be boundaries and limits set within this project, after all I am a convicted criminal.</br></br>I can foresee that, but to share in detail, as I do, with a random stranger or strangers, just not what I hope to be in. Not asking for pics, or a phone number, or even a pen pal. Just want to know if this is a formal, professional correspondence project or just a project for prisoners to vent out on to hopefully find material to help with the agenda of prison reform.</br></br>I’m interested in networks, community, agency, service, and don’t have much time for passing time. If that makes any sense. I’m going places that requires relentless discipline and focus on fixing the problems that exist within me. Sharing my story helps to acknowledge those things that made my imprisonment possible, but I will politely petition you and all of you at UCI, to only seek me if you find that I may be of a benefit or an asset to your project.</br></br>I am a busy and devoted man to being the person my God created me to be. For your consideration in writing to me thank you and everyone in your team. Hopefully, this is a start to something great. If not, I am grateful for your letter and your hopeful words in it. I wish you all the best results in this endeavor. Blessing on you all.</br></br>Sincerely.</br></br>Feel free to use any part of the things I share, should you want to. You have my permission to do so.
