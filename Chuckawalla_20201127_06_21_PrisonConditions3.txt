This story was told by a person incarcerated at Chuckawalla.</br></br>

Caller: And it seems like staff is, I'm not going to say that they're insensitive about it, but a lot of them joke about how they want it. They want to get it. They want to get the two weeks paid and have two weeks off paid vacation. So, they're almost counting on getting it. I've seen where officers kind of come and they want to hang out with inmates who do have it. Others, you know, are kind of, you know, standoffish. They don't want to get it because they don't want, you know, the consequences that happen from getting it.
