This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Norco.</br></br>

We are fed in our bed area. So the only place to eat is on your bed. There are two tables with four seats, etc. in dayroom, so we have no place to sit and eat, a lot to mention, six feet social distancing. So we do not go anyplace out of our dorm, no work, no nothing, yet CRC gets all this extra money for our care.</br></br> 

But nothing has changed at all, where does all that money go? I have filed a writ of habeas corpus on inhuman conditions, it dirty and way overcrowded. I understand we broke the law, and it’s not suppose to be a vacation. However, I left Delancey Street</br></br> 

I don’t feel my life should be jeopardized in this way, regardless of my crime, we all are supposed to have some rights. I had to file habeas corpus just so I can have a judge order them to have me checked out by a specialist because after COVID, I have been having difficulty breathing.</br></br> 
 
And we’re also asking the judge to order a 50 percent reduction in our population so that we are not living in a “super spreader” environment. For whatever reason, CDCR just refuses to use Prop 57 for what it was intended for and let some of these guys out who qualify. Because CDCR keep denying people saying that they don’t have enough rehabilitation programs in!</br></br> 

However, like myself, I have been on a waiting list that is a couple years long due to overcrowding, so they have no way of doing any programs and now we are locked down. It’s sad, but it's all about money, they get money for everybody in here, allowing people released and they lose their cash cow!</br></br> 
 
The problem is I have no voice to let the public know what’s really going on! There is so much more I could tell you if you’re interested. I also have a lot of documents to actually prove what I claim.</br></br> 
 
One last thing, my lawyer who’s doing my habeas, he said on CDCR’s website that out of every 1,000 people tested here, 95.5 percent have tested positive for COVID, 5 percent of population has “a lot” been infected. Since then it went from 95.5 percent to 115 percent, that’s because some have been infected multiple times. But it truly seems nobody really cares.</br></br>  

So far about 150 inmates here in California state prisons have died. Not counting federal prisons or county jails, just the 35 California prisons! Most unnecessarily, sad.
