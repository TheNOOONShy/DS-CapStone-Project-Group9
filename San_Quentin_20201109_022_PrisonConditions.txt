This letter was written by a person incarcerated at San Quentin.</br></br>

You would think San Quentin would have some sympathy or empathy but no such luck. The food here is horrible. They keep us locked down for 46 and a half hours. Then for one and a half hours, we're allowed a shower, a phone call, and some yard.</br></br> 

I understand I'm in prison for committing a crime, but this coronavirus is a dealbreaker. When I was in court, they didn't mention this in the agreement, and San Quentin broke the agreement by bringing those infected prisoners here from CIM. So, for that, I quit the game. It's over.</br></br>

I wanna go home. This is really stressful. We were doing just fine before COVID. What San Quentin doesn't understand, there is no vaccine for this virus.</br></br> 

No one knows about the side effects. Anything can happen. How many more will have to die before they stop wasting the taxpayers' dollars and let us go? Anything can happen to me.</br></br> 

I'm 60 years old. So, yes, I'm very scared, and you have my life in the hands of an institution that doesn't have any consideration for my well-being.
