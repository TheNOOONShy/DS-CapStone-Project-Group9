UCI: What do you mean by "cleaning"? Do you have certain individuals that are assigned to clean or sanitize the dayroom that don't and so, then, other individuals feel as if they have to take over? Or do you - I mean do the COs or any staff do that?</br></br>Caller: That is exactly what is going on right here.</br></br>There are individuals that are assigned to those positions that just ain't doing their job. They just got a bad work ethic. So other people that are, basically, picking up the slack and doing it for them. You know? Me, personally, every time I eat in the dayroom, I actually clean. I clean after myself. And, unfortunately, not everybody does that here. You know? It's like there's grown men here. Yeah. Exactly.
