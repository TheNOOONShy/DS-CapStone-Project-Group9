This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Calipatria.</br></br>

Hello,</br></br>

This letter comes from Calipatria State Prison. I'm currently serving time at Calipatria State Prison. COVID-19 has been one of the most difficult challenges I had ever seen and faced in my life. I worry for me, my family, and all the man and women behind bars.</br></br>

The COVID-19 pandemic hit our country and those of us in our incarcerated community. Yet, however dim this moment, there is hope at the end of this tunnel.</br></br>

We are unable to use the only method of social interaction permitted within the prison system, due to the family visit and regular weekend visits being cancelled. We are only getting one zoom visit for 30 minutes every 30 days by appointment.</br></br>

I worry for my health inside these prison walls. In the free world, society can adjust to the protocol of social distancing from others, but these who are incarcerated like me are not afforded that liberty. We are forced to be close to one another in cells/ dorms, and outdoor/ yard areas. Due to the dense population and proximity, COVID-19 can spread rapidly throughout the prison.</br></br>

I fear COVID-19 spreading by correctional officers, mental health providers, and medical staff consistently coming in and out of the prison. Presenting a high risk of infection for all of us incarcerated. I fear for my safety and well-being on a daily basis. Those who get COVID-19 are being sent to an ad seg unit and do not receive the medical treatment needed to fight, recover, or stop the spread of this deadly virus within the prison. The stress and fear come from not knowing if I will see my loved ones ever again.</br></br>

I am thankful for those teams like your organization that helps those of us incarcerated deal with the challenges. Thank you for the ongoing support. I feel comfortable sharing my fears and journeys. I hope everyone incarcerated will get to see their loved ones again.</br></br>

Stay safe, wash your hands.
