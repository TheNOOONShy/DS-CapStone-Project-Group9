This letter was written by a person incarcerated at High Desert.</br></br>

[Redacted] & [redacted] -</br></br>

My name is [redacted]. My celly got a letter from you guys and as it so happens I am currently going through “long-term” COVID-19 problems and complications. I am always scared to go to sleep in fear that I will not wake up! I am so glad to be heard from someone.</br></br>

I have had this virus for 78 days! Guess what this is the second time I got COVID! In 1 year! I can barely breathe! Bad anxiety, no smell, no taste, thoughts of dying from it!</br></br>

The only person I talk to is my dad. I have no other support! Will you guys write back? I would love that!</br></br>

Ok, so medical care here is obsolete! I have reached out for help over 10 times in the last 30 days! NO TREATMENT, NO MEDICINE.</br></br>

Truthfully I pray that I will survive this! It is a miracle that you wrote my celly [redacted] because of this situation. If I do pass away, please put something nice on the page for me. I am a believer in the Lord, Jesus Christ, and God!</br></br>

I came to prison with a 5 year sentence and I get out in 1 year! As long as I survive!</br></br>

Anyways, feel free to write and ask questions or whatever and thank you for taking time for us. God bless.
