Hi. I know you doing you lol. I was at Lee County I was not sick there. I am 34 years old let me tell you I am locked up for a production of child pornography and I have 250,000 and can't pay it.</br></br>

I got 30 years for it. I got attacked by the COs and inmates in the shu housing they told the inmates what I was locked up on and they took my food and this been going on for nine months and I went to [redacted] and been there for nine as well.</br></br>

But when I was there I had got COVID. I don't think I got tested but I got COVID in three months so I went to a quarantine. I was there for 18 days. I felt good but I could not stop my nose from a running nose and to today I am the same way now.</br></br>

Then I went to OKC and no testing was done. I have been at OKC for two weeks and I did not get COVID but I was around other who may had or got COVID. But I went to Atwater penitentiary USP. Here I went to quarantine been in quarantine for 16 days and then I went to gropop or pp.</br></br> 

Well I want to know what you think about all that. See you soon or not lol.
