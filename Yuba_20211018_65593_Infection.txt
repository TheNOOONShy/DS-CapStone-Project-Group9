This story was told by a person incarcerated at an ICE/Private-Contractor facility.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah absolutely, so what has the COVID situation been like each time you've gone in?</br></br>

Caller: It wasn't—I just got out of a state facility, and we were like locked down. We were getting—I was actually excited. I felt kind of bad actually because I was like, we were locked up, we were amongst the first I think of the public really to get the Moderna vaccinations. I was really excited about that. I got it in February. During this time, when they picked me up on this arrest right now, what was it? August.</br></br> 

These guys they show up particularly. It was kind of annoying to me because they are still running guys in and out for violations. The petty stuff, it’s a small county. It’s how they make money is locking people up.</br></br>

They've been keeping them coming, but we had breakouts. I was in a unit—a quarantine unit, and we had- they had two guys come down with it in a unit of 20 cells, so it could house like up to 40 people, but they had two guys come down with it within—it was actually like the day I got there or a day before I got there, two guys came down with it.</br></br> 

Then another, I think it was six after that. It was like eight total in one week. I know there are 20 cells, but I we didn't have everybody double celled, so we only had like 20 people in there, and I was kind of amazed because the walls aren't—it's not completely sealed. Like the front part of your cell is open.</br></br>

How do you say, it's like, there's no covering, like there’s no wall. It is just a metal thing like a grille or something. So, I was really surprised. It's really a small unit and had like eight guys in one week come down with it.</br></br>
