This story was told by a person incarcerated at Ventura County Main Jail.</br></br> 

UCI: Awesome. Okay. Go ahead and tell me about your experience.</br></br> 

Caller: Well, my experience actually starts in New York, in June. I went there on a vacation for my birthday. And I found out that they were using the top half of my hotel for like a– for the prisoners of a nearby jail. And I booked it a month in advance and they did not tell me that– that was what they were doing.</br></br> 

And I went into the– the west entrance of the hotel and found out that they had put a wall down the middle. Because the two hotels one on top of the other one’s a Fairfield and the other’s a Springhill Suites. Anyway, they took off–they took–the top half of the hotel. Anyway, so then, I get back here and they started, you know, masks weren’t mandated in some areas and they were in others.</br></br> 

And I– I got my– I had– I’ve had two COVID shots in- back in April, for the Moderna shots. And I had a dispute with a neighbor and they had me "swatted", basically, on [redacted]. And that's how long I've been in here. And I found one of your letters, by chance, and I've been sending you things with–actually with my full name on it.</br></br> 

But I– I won't tell you that now. But I also sent return envelopes for you to send the information to my brother and he lives in Irvine. And I actually– both– both he and I graduated from UCLA. I graduated in 1987. I just turned 56. And the fun fact, I was actually redirected when I applied to UCLA to UC Irvine.</br></br> 

And he wrote a letter saying that I needed to commute. So, I’ve been in here, and I've had– let's see. One, two, three, four COVID tests because they have an outbreak of COVID at their other facility which is called Todd Road, T-O-D-D Road.</br></br> 

And, I’m also HIV positive and they are giving me my HIV medications and I just had a tooth pulled. And so, I’m getting medical and dental. And my brother has supplied me with glasses ‘cause I’m nearsighted and when they arrested me, I didn’t have my glasses on. And they emptied my pockets so it’s not like I could've had my cellphone or anything with me when they arrested me.</br></br> 

And actually, they teargassed my house and I got a lung full of teargas. And I was in my bathroom and I had to wet my shirt and breathe through the shirt just to calm down. And– ‘cause they did not tell me that they were going to teargas me. And– so that’s where I’m at and I found one of your letters under the doorway of another person who is not here anymore.</br></br> 

And actually, it was a– a [redacted] sent several letters to this person. Even though they have one booking number and the problem is that– that sometimes, they put aliases for us. And he had several aliases. So, [redacted] sent him several letters, even though it was the one booking number. So, would you like to know anything specific?</br></br> 

UCI: That was great. Thank you for sharing your story. What has it been like– have you been able to receive medical for your– anything besides COVID during the pandemic?</br></br> 

Caller: Yes. I’m– I’m also diagnosed with bipolar disorder so I take medicine at night to help me sleep because I have mania. You know, keeps my brain switched on. And so, the medication I take helps me switch the brain off so I can sleep.</br></br> 

But the problem is– is that we’re– we have dinner around 4:30 or 5 o’clock, and we don’t have breakfast until around 6:30 a.m. So there’s not much to– to do except watch the TV out of your cell– cell door. But they do come by every hour, to do a count. And so, I’m at the top of the stairs and they have to use a device to press it against a button that’s on the door.</br></br> 

And so they do one and eleven, which are on the end on the top level. And then there’s two and twelve ‘cause there’s twelve cells with two beds in them each. But there’s only, right now, there’s only one of us per– per cell because we are in the psych– well I'm in the psych special needs division. I have a yellow wristband.</br></br> 

And it has my booking photo on it and my name and my booking number. And then it says, [redacted]. And we have three phones and– but this particular cell block, we’re not allowed to fraternize with each other. So who’s ever out in day room, which is what it’s called it’s when you have an hour a day to– you get control of the TV.</br></br> 

So, right now, I have it on CNN and I’m seeing all about the Omicron that’s sweeping the nation and the globe. And it’s really quite saddening to see things in the news. Like the tornadoes recently and the school shootings and the– just you know? Things are just I think a little bit out of control with this pandemic.</br></br> 

And I recently lost both my parents. And I actually thought I had COVID at the end of 2019 because I had– I think– maybe just I had a really bad flu. But I was– I was– I had a terrible cough and I had– like when I would cough, my head would really really hurt.</br></br> 

And since I have HIV, my– my immune system is not as strong as a regular person’s. But, I thought that you know, since COVID-19 is a virus and HIV is also a virus, I thought this new medication that I was on, called Biktarvy, B-I-K-T-A-R-V-Y, was actually something that I’ve been on since December of 2017. And I had stopped taking it while on vacation because I had a bad experience at the Gucci store.</br></br> 

And I found the special code, on the back of my card, was actually six-six-six. So I was not happy– I was not happy about that special code being the– the mark of a devil. So anyway– but I was tested on [redacted], and my viral load was non-detect and I hadn’t taken any until I was tested here on [redacted].</br></br> 

And my viral load was 4.999 and non-detect is less than 50. And I’ve since gone back on Biktarvy at the urging of my doctor here. And now my viral load is below 3. So, the virus is becoming less active in my system. But I was off of it for about two and a half months.</br></br> 

And you know, now, they’re coming out with an antiviral pill from Pfizer. And you know– and also we need– everyone needs a shot and that’s– because this virus is airborne and HIV is bloodborne. And it can be passed through blood transfusions or you know, unsafe sex—which is how a lot of sexually transmitted diseases are– are transmitted.</br></br> 

But– oh, there goes Kamala Harris. Which is, you know, she’s from California. We love Kamala. So– and– but we have been allowed visits. We can have in-person visits here and they usually take place on a Sunday.</br></br> 

But, right now, my visits have been suspended because I got into trouble with another inmate. And he gets to walk around like nothing happened and I’m the one who gets punished. But I think it's– [redacted] is when they allowed personal visits in– in the– in the jail here. But of course, you have to come in with a mask.</br></br> 

And the– the rooms are separated, of course, by the glass partitions. And you talk on the phone like you see in the– in the movies or on TV. And– but I’m really not– I mean I'm– I'm hanging in here but I’m really not happy with the way I’ve been treated. And other than that, the food is crap, but we’re allowed to buy our own snacks.</br></br> 

We get to use 80 dollars a– a week to buy snacks and they’re delivered on a Tuesday or a Wednesday. And we can get Cheetos and Oreos and M&M– Peanut M&M's and Grandma’s Peanut Butter Cookies. There’s– we can get decaf coffee. We can’t get regular because we’re in the psych ward or– or cell block.</br></br> 

So, and we’re not allowed to get razors, but they do let us use a shaver on the weekends to shave our heads. And I did have that tooth extracted so I got free dental and it only took about five minutes. It was my last wisdom tooth. And I was prescribed an antibiotic but my infectious disease doctor, who treats my HIV, suggests that it would– he does not like to use antibiotics if they're not necessary so I’ve been refusing that.</br></br> 

But I’ve been taking all my other medications and so my health is fine. I’m in a good head space right now. And I’m glad that you finally answered because I tried a couple weeks ago I believe because I usually get day– day rooms during the day. And– and you’re only available between five and nine during the week. So that’s one thing.</br></br> 

But I have sent things to [redacted]?</br></br> 

UCI: Yeah, that sounds right.</br></br> 

Caller: Yeah. So, I don’t know. Are you a student? At UCI right now?</br></br> 

UCI: Yeah. I actually just graduated in the spring. So I’m no longer. But I’m still helping out in the project.</br></br> 

Caller: Oh, okay.</br></br> 

UCI: Thank you.</br></br> 

Caller: It’s– it’s– it’s very good of you to this because yeah. It is impacting the communities with the, you know, people having to go to court and we’re all, you know? The deputies are all walking around with their masks covering their mouth, but they don’t cover their nose.</br></br> 

And the only– the only place we get hand sanitizer is if we go through the tunnel to the court side. They don’t have any han– hand sanitizer for us here, although you can get antibacterial soap through the commissary. But of course, you have to spend your own money for all this commissary stuff.</br></br> 

So, my brother has to put money in my account, and then I have to fill out a Scantron. And then, they– they bring me my stuff. So I’ve– I’ve bought a lot of stamps and envelopes. And I’m sending you postcards, with artwork on it, from other inmates.</br></br> 

And I'm sort of in control of everything because they don’t really care and they’re in here. We’re all kind of in here for the long haul right now. We’re probably gonna be in here through at least [redacted].</br></br> 

Most of us– because there’s one gentleman– he’s been waiting for a placement in a– in like a sober house. But there’s– I don’t know. Apparently, there’s a very few openings for these sober houses right now.</br></br> 

UCI: Yeah. I was gonna ask how has the court system been like with the pandemic?</br></br> 

Caller: You know, it’s– it’s really crazy because it’s all done on Zoom. And we go into these things. They call them, “Condos.” But, it’s just a room with a bench and then there’s a computer screen. And then, you see who you’re gonna talk to—like my public defender.</br></br> 

But then they have like a Spanish interpreter ‘cause there’s a lot of Latino men in here, of course, ‘cause we’re in California. And, so they have an interpreter. But people pop in and pop out and they– someone’s in– someone’s seems to be in control of who comes on the screen. So sometimes, if you’re talking, you’ll be on the screen or the judge will be on the screen.</br></br> 

And then, he asks you, “Oh, who’s in Condo [redacted],” and “What’s your name?” And– and then you know, “who’s”—. And then, my public defender has someone fill in for her ‘cause they have to be in court. But, she– she Zooms me from home.</br></br> 

And sometimes, people Zoom and they’ve got the background is like, you know, a beach scene with a palm tree. Or they blur the background ‘cause they’re at home and sometimes, you know, a family member or a roommate will– will walk behind them and go in the bathroom or something. I don’t know.</br></br> 

It’s very very strange. And you learn about other people and how they– some one guy had a SCRAM, which is a– a device that– will tell you if he’s– he’s consumed any alcohol ‘cause he’s on parole. And he can’t drink alcohol and he has to do meetings with– in-person meetings with his parole officer.</br></br> 

And he has to pay 200 dollars– like 217 dollars or 231 dollars for the SCRAM. And he barely makes that and he lives with his parents. And he– and he works at a– a variety arts center as an usher, which will be probably closing down soon ‘cause they’re probably closing down venues like that again.</br></br> 

So– and there’s– there’s subpoenas that have to be served to Verizon and T-Mobile and– and Lazy Dog. All of which I’m familiar ‘cause I– I had a– I bought an iPhone in [redacted]. And I had it activated at the T-Mobile store, just down the street and around the corner on [redacted].</br></br> 

But, it was nice to be somewhere, where we did have to show to go into some bars and restaurants you did have to show your– your vaccination card. And they were only allowing, I believe at the time, Pfizer and Moderna and Johnson and Johnson.</br></br> 

And one gentleman said, “Well, I got my vaccine in China.” So, you know, this was a bar that was just like, “Oh, we only accept the three vaccinations.” So, oh– and now I’m listening to Fauci on CNN.</br></br> 

So– and then, it’s also interesting to see people on the news say you know, “Oh I’m– you know, I have a perfect– I’m perfectly healthy. I don’t need to get the vaccine yet.” And it’s like, “Oh and if I get the vaccine, I can still get COVID.”</br></br> 

It’s like– well, the point is to be vaccinated so that, you know, you fend off and you get over COVID faster—so that you’re not gonna spread it to other people. And people just don’t seem to understand the reason that they need to be vaccinated. And I saw the one guy, in the news, who had a fake arm—who was getting a vaccine so they can go back to work.</br></br> 

And then, my brother said there was another gentleman who was getting vaccinated for all his coworkers;  so they could go back to work and he got like seven vaccines. And that’s just, you know? It’s just crazy how we’re not keeping track of these things properly.</br></br> 

And– and you know, even Israel is going back into lockdown. And they were one of first countries to get, you know, most of their citizens vaccinated. So–</br></br> 

UCI: Yeah. Have you seen any vaccine increases in your facility?</br></br> 

Caller: We get testing and they– I was in– I’m in [redacted]. And I was in [redacted] ‘cause that’s where we go for video conferencing. And they actually had to put me in a– in one of the hallways. And I look– saw on the– on the door that– that– that was where they had to quarantine people who did test COVID positive.</br></br> 

And my brother told me that when he was in court with me on, I believe it was [redacted], there was a gentleman in the court building. Even though everyone had to wear masks, he was in there and he said he was COVID positive. So you know? But, he had to be there to be in court.</br></br> 

So it’s– it’s not like you get a pass if you’re COVID positive. You’d have to show up no matter, you know, what your status is. So, that was just very alarming for me—considering that I do have another chronic disease that leaves me with a weakened immune system. But, my numbers are good and they– they are giving me blood tests on a regular basis.</br></br> 

And they test– they– they weigh us, they check our blood pressure. One gentleman had diabetes so, they were checking his– his blood sugar every day. And another gentleman is refusing to eat. All he eats are cookies and bread and the Kool-Aid packets that they give us at lunch.</br></br> 

And he’s getting– he’s lost– he says he’s lost– he was at 160 and he says on his door that he’s now 116. And all he asks for are Ensures, you know, the– the vitamin and protein drinks. And– but, we do get every morning– after morning chow, at 6:30. Around 7:30 or 8, we get our morning pills.</br></br> 

And then, some people get afternoon pills. But then, we get– around 9 or 9:30, we get our evening pills. So that– those are the pills that help me get to sleep. And then, they also give me the antibiotic which I refuse to take because it kills off the bad and the good bacteria in your gut.</br></br> 

And they don’t give us any like probiotics or any yogurt. We don’t get yogurt. Generally, we get– generally cold when we get it. But we get pancakes and sausage and like an oatmeal and orange slices and like– a little cup with milk in it.</br></br> 

And then at lunch, we generally, sometimes there’s the hamburger. There’s a hotdog. There’s like a chicken fried steak or a– or a beef patty with mashed potatoes and gravy. And there’s spaghetti. There’s meatballs.</br></br> 

There’s chicken nuggets with barbecue sauce. But the thing is, it’s really interesting ‘cause they always– all of the condiments are– even though they have preservatives in them, they’re all– they all come like they’re refrigerated. So we get– not only do we get cold pancakes with whipped oil instead of like butter.</br></br> 

But the– the syrup comes cold. So no matter what– what you do, they– they refrigerate everything. So, and then we get salads for lunch and dinner. And sometimes we get– but the problem is that they also stack the trays. So you know, it’s like, you know?</br></br> 

Someone in the kitchen has COVID on– somehow gets on their hands or gets on the counter where they’re making the trays. And then, they put the trays on top of each other so, that the bottom tray, you know? The food on the bottom tray gets whatever is on the bottom of the top tray.</br></br> 

So it’s just– I don’t know. It’s just very bizarre. And then we have the cleaning cart that they bring in here with disinfectant. So, we have to sweep out and mop our own cells. And the– and the– the floors around here and some people clean.</br></br> 

There’s one, two, three, four tables that normally people would be sitting at and getting to know each other. But, we don’t get to do that—even though we’re all in here and we’re all COVID negative. So– but– and then, there’s other– there’s other rooms where people get to watch movies or they have arts and crafts.</br></br> 

So, they have some sort of library where you can read books. And there’s other cell blocks that have couches in them where people get to sit together. But apparently, they’re not yellow band and they get to watch the TV. And then, there’s athletic rooms where you can do exercises.</br></br> 

But today, we– at my insistence, we got to go to the roof. Now, the roof has large cages and the largest one that seems to be a half-court basketball. But, there’s no basket and there’s– they just have handballs. So, the first time we got to go up there, I was first. So, I took the biggest– I took the half-court.</br></br> 

And there’s one gentleman in here who– who stripped down to just his socks and his shoes, while we were up there. And he’s also the one that I’ve been battling with—even though he seems to be– says that he’s an ex-pastor. But, and also, I’ve gotten a– a Bible and several booklets from the chaplain here.</br></br> 

And I’ve had a visit from a gentleman and we read some passages from the Bible. And I have decided that I am now a Christian because I believe in Jesus and I believe in heaven. And I just believe that the– this is just a hiccup in the road of my life. And that it’s just a matter of time before I am free again.</br></br> 

UCI: Has– has finding your faith been a– a tool to cope through the pandemic and what you’re going through?</br></br> 

Caller: Well, the problem is– is that there’s no they– when you get booked, they say that there’s the handbook. Well, apparently, the handbook is just a page– a piece of paper. So they tell you that, “Oh, you broke a rule and that this is the rule and it’s two eight whatever or whatever or whatever.”</br></br> 

And then– then they don't give you the– so it’s like you break a rule but you don’t know that you’ve broken it until you’ve broken it. So it’s– it’s kind of in a backwards, you know? It’s like, “Oh, by the way, you can’t order a greeting card because you’re on restriction.”</br></br> 

So– and a greeting card is not food. So, right now, I'm on restriction. A commissary restriction for food. So I’m having the other guys order food for me and then I trade them things like soap or you know? We can get Sensodyne or Colgate toothpaste, but we get this toothpaste called, “Maximum Security.”</br></br> 

Which is manufactured by Bob Barker and so are our– our blues. We have blues and oranges and we get fresh clothing every Thursday night and Sunday night. But I actually found 11 bed bugs in my orange– one of my orange shirts. And I don’t know if it came out of the shirt or if they came out of the– ‘cause we get two blankets and a– and a mattress.</br></br> 

And so, and every night, the lights dim. And that’s why I stay in the bottom bunk because the light is right above the top bunk and I can’t sleep on the top bunk with the light. So– so, fortunately, there’s no one to argue who gets the top or the bottom bunk. So I just– and then they– we have a little table to sit at and it’s not a chair.</br></br> 

It’s like a – a cement post that’s maybe about 11 inches in diameter that we sit on at the table. So if there’s two people, one person gets to sit at the table, and then the other person gets to stand and eat their– their dinner on the top bunk. And– and then sometimes, there’s one gentleman who seems to have Tourette's and they always let him out last.</br></br> 

And then they– instead of letting bringing him his food, it takes them about five minutes ‘cause he also appears to have OCD. So, he starts down the stairs and then he comes back up and then he’ll say, “hello” to me. And then, he goes back down.</br></br> 

And then, he gets it and it just– and sometimes at night, he just– he just– his Tourette’s really takes over. And he– he screams and he yells he– he curses. So, oh– well, here comes the pills. Okay so-</br></br> 

UCI: Thank you. Yeah, thank you so much for calling. Yeah we– we close the hotline at nine but feel free to call us tomorrow, from like five to nine same time.</br></br> 

Caller: Okay.</br></br> 

UCI: But, I really appreciate talking to you tonight. Thank you so much.</br></br> 

Caller: Okay. And my initials are [redacted]. You’ll see a lot of my stuff. I– I did some artwork.</br></br> 

UCI: That’s amazing. We love that.</br></br> 

Caller: And other stuff so—</br></br> 

UCI: We love it. Keep it coming. Thank you so much.</br></br> 

Caller: I will. Thank you very much.</br></br> 

UCI: You’re welcome. Bye-bye.</br></br> 

Caller: Okay. Bye-bye.
