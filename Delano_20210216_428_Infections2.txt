This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Delano.</br></br>

Some touch the fountain with the hand that they use to grab medication that they put in their mouth. January 1, 2021 I got called for another test because I came in contact with another COVID-19 infected person. Either an escort or medical staff. My test came back positive.</br></br> 

I unfortunately put my cellie in a messed up situation because now he is being tested. And even though he came back negative, he was told to pack up because we are both going to separate and be put in quarantine.</br></br> 

The positive were sent to a different yard as the ones that just came in contact with a positive person. Now we are forced to leave the comfort of our cell to a cell without electricity for the next 14 days.</br></br> 

I ended up at the same building as the previous time just two cells away. Still there were no outlets in those cells.</br></br> 

Administration at the institution had told the men’s advisory council to let the general population, that they were going to work on installing the plug as maintenance. Just had to take off the plates that covered the plugs and replace it with one that had the opening on the plugs.</br></br> 

However, we were later informed that the warden decided that it was too expensive. That our comfort was just not worth it. So you could imagine all the prisoners' frustration. Some spent over 20 or more days there. I spent 14 days.</br></br> 

After that bitter experience I was sent back to general population. This time it was to a different building and cell and new cellie. I was fortunate enough to not get real sick, I had body cramps (body pains).</br></br> 

Medical gave me Tylenol and they would check my blood pressure on a daily basis, twice a day, and make sure my temperature was normal. This looks like it’s the new norm here, not to get comfortable. Because any moment you may be going back to quarantine. Now I brought batteries for my radio, ordered a few books to read for my next trip.</br></br> 

Now besides the way things are being dealt with to prevent spread, which by the way didn’t work because most of this yard has been diagnosed as positive. A few have been lucky enough not to get sick or catch COVID-19.</br></br> 

Nonetheless, went through the quarantine process. Those that have been offered the COVID-19 vaccine and most accepted it. Anyone that got COVID-19 had to wait after three months and test negative before receiving it, if they want it.
