Second to having contracted COVID-19, the most traumatic impact the pandemic has had on me was the cancellation of my Board of Parole Hearing. I had a Board of Parole hearing scheduled for December 23, 2020. However, it was cancelled because the housing unit I lived in was on quarantine. I did not have COVID-19 at the time, but after the inmate population was tested on December 11, 2020, one inmate, out of about 290 inmates in the housing unit tested positive, the housing unit was placed on quarantine. On December 18, 2020, all the inmates in the housing unit, including me, tested negative for COVID-19.</br></br>

Up to and on December 23, 2020, I under the impression I would be going to the Board of Parole Hearing as scheduled. The Hearing was scheduled for 10:30 AM. At about 10:15 AM I asked a correctional officer to call the Board Room to see why I had not been called to the Board Room. When the correctional officer returned, he informed me the Hearing had been cancelled because “I” was on quarantine.</br></br>

Remember, I had tested twice and each teat was negative, during a two week period, the last test five days prior to my hearing. And after the test results from December 11, 2020, were returned on December 14th, 2020, indicating the one positive result for one inmate, I, as well as the other inmates in the housing unit, was placed on quarantine. So, I was isolated in my cell and provided a negative test a week after the test on December 11, 2020. In other words, there was no way I had COVID-19 on the date of my Board of Parole Hearing.</br></br> 

After the inmates in the housing unit were removed from quarantine, I had a conversation with a supervisor regarding my Board of parole Hearing on December 23, 2020 being cancelled. I was told the Board of Parole Hearing Commissioner would not hold the Hearing with me wearing a mask. Keep in mind, this was a virtual hearing. The room where the virtual hearing would be held is about 40 feet by 20 feet (at least).</br></br>

The only people actually in the room would be me two correctional officers and me. The room has windows that can be opened and is large enough the correctional officers could be at least 30 feet from me. Oh, by the way, the same officers who would search me, while I was wearing a mask, prior to me entering the room.</br></br>

The institution held the position that I could not take the mask off during the Hearing. Therefore, the Commissioner cancelled the Hearing. As of this date the Hearing has not been re-scheduled. In theory, my term in prison has been extended due to my being prevented from attending the Hearing on December 23, 2020, of course, this is contingent on me being found suitable for parole at that Hearing and Governor Newsom agreeing with that decision.</br></br> 

What I find ironic about this is a law recently passed in California, which advances Board of parole Hearings who are 50 years old and have served 15 years in prison. One of the reasons cited in the bill was COVID-19. So release people because of COVID-19 but do not hold the Hearings because of COVID-19.</br></br>
