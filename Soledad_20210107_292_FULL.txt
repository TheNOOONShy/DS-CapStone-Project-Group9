This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Soledad.</br></br>

Well they finally got me out of that infected dorm. I was there for 18 days and I didn’t test positive. Never tested positive and I've been tested on three different occasions and never once positive! I even saw a man die right in front of me with a CO giving him CPR and the dude was dead already. That’s crazy huh!</br></br>

I saw what that COVID-19 does to people. It just takes the wind out of you and you have trouble breathing because it is attacking the lungs. That’s a cold way to go, but that is just the way it is. I cannot describe it any other way except the way I’ve seen it!</br></br>

I wouldn’t wish this on anybody, not even my worst enemy. Well maybe a couple, just kidding, but yeah it’s a cold way to go! These people fucked up. They didn’t have a plan on how you are going to put uninfected people with infected people. Go figure that one out and that’s what they’re doing, the beat goes on estan pendejos sabes, no pun intended!</br></br>

What they should have done was lock up this whole prison for 30 days and I mean the whole prison. Instead, they dropped the ball, oh send these guys over here and these guys over there and let’s see what happens and boom they drop the bomb on themselves. That’s exactly what happened just like how America wasn’t ready.</br></br>

The same thing with CDR. They weren’t ready. Why? Because you need really good CDC doctors and even they were caught off guard because they were dismantled. Saying we didn’t need pandemic crisis doctors. The big dogs with the PhD’s. Our leader, Trump, just dropped the ball. I'm going to leave it at that, because the more I talk about it, it just gets me mad!</br></br>

What I would like to do is sue the CDC for messing with my head and let me tell you about COVID-19 and seeing these people and what it was doing to them. The really sick ones and me being right there with them, uninfected, hell yea that messed with my mind!</br></br>

Yes they deserve a lawsuit! Thank God I came out there OK health-wise. Mentally, I don’t know. I know that shit is going to bother me for a while after seeing what happens later!</br></br>

There was a trip my nephew was attending back in 2018 or 2019 but she was transferred to Oklahoma. The soonest he is out of Cathedral City, California He had said that it was a very expensive school and what was more expensive was the rent on the housing around the area. That's really why he left.</br></br>

Over there he has an apartment on campus and he is doing really well! That is why when I got a letter from you guys it just tripped me out. Small world!</br></br>

I want to thank you for taking the time to write to us because there are a lot of other people who have received letters from you guys! But like I said earlier in my letter, if you can help me in suing these people it would be deeply appreciated. Thank you.</br></br>

And likewise sending you good thoughts and good luck with your studies, take care and hopefully we will all have a good year.
