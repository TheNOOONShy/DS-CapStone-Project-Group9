This letter was written by a person incarcerated at High Desert.</br></br>

My time at High Desert during the pandemic has been horrible. I haven't been able to see my family because visiting is closed down. We're not getting our store like we normally do. We're not able to sign up for school because school is not open.</br></br> 

It's been tough up here for a lot of us. There's guys that have level 3 points here who are stuck on the level 4 because they're not doing any transfers. We just had an outbreak where a majority of us had the virus. It was bad for a lot of us.</br></br> 

Hopefully soon we'll be able to go back to normal programs so this place can open up again. I've been writing music and working out to keep my mind focused, and keeping in contact with my family by letters and phone.</br></br> 

This has been by far one of the worst experiences for me. I just pray things get better soon.
