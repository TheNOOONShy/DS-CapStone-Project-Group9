When COVID-19 hit all programming schedules ceased. Kapūt. Nada. Over!</br></br>


COVID-19. What can I say about it? I will say all of us in the prison system, inmates as well as staff, cooperated with Governmental restrictions. That’s a plvs. On the negative side you always have those skeptics, in life who laugh it off as a “big ass flu” and refuse to obey orders such as wearing a mask.</br></br>


And it is ordered that we wear them. I love it because I’m sort of a bacteria freak. Right on! Bring out the masks.</br></br>


Hooray! Early on in the month of April 2020 my cellie Redacted contracted the virus and they Quarantined our butts for 14 days. Horrible! Stuck in a 6” by 8” cell with a COVID-19 “Zombie” and I'm border line schitzoid when it comes to “Alien Visitors” such as bacteria and virus’ in the cell.</br></br>


They were afraid. I mean men were dying here. Luckily most of us have a fantastic type of mentality because no one panicked. I mean heck you got men in here doing life without the possibility of parole so for them COVID-19 was just a way outta this “bitch” sorry that's what we call prison sometimes. </br></br>


 I was, and still am, praying a lot. For family, friends, and even the regular Redacted out there or Redacted that were being heroes in the hospitals and firetrucks, police cars, and even our next store neighbor. So I kinda think of myself as a prayer warrior. I mean I got nuttin’ but time, right?</br></br>


Being in this bubble can be like a wild fire set off in a box and we ain’t got nowhere to go. Bye bye cruel world. So how do I cope. At first by biting the heck out of my nails but now fast forward again to April 2021 and things are 1/2 way back to normal so I can pray, I go to school, I work as a porter, I meditate, but mostly I think about going home, in three years, and making my way through what I got left of life in the most positive, successful way possible. </br></br>


One more question to answer and that's about the vaccinations. 90 percent of the men in my bldg. have been vaccinated. Hopefully the rest of the institution has followed suit. I hope and pray my letter was satisfactorily presented for your amusement, inspection or whatever suits your fancy.</br></br>
