To those who are concerned, PrisonPandemic, and the “team” workers at UCI whom addressed me...Hi.</br></br>


I find it refreshing to receive a letter from you, pertaining to the coronavirus, COVID-19, truly. While being incarcerated it has been a trial and tribulation.</br></br>


First, let me properly introduce myself to you. I am a 77 year old African American and Muslim. My particular case (conviction, charges) has been presented to the Federal Courts (Federal District to U.S. Supreme Court, certiorari). I have spent a lot of my time in prison speaking to my fellow inmates based on morals, ethics, and equity in life, and sometimes to crowds of a 100 to 200 inmates. I’ve learned quite a deal in these stoops (prison complexes), I speak well and have been well spoken of.</br></br>


Now about this COVID-19 virus in prison. Truly a pandemic, this particular virus stemming from SARS has caused so much havoc and devastation. Taking us by surprise and knocking us for a lope. It almost rendered us helpless, knocking all lives that matters down, get this, without a smoking gun in total confusion we were. Even the so-called cure will carry prolonged symptoms.</br></br>


My experience after being exposed: let me say this to you and the team at UCI about this SARS-COV-2, first and foremost I took the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine (I have not taken a flu shot in over fifty some odd years) and even though I took both shots, I still contracted the virus, and was quarantined amongst other inmates.</br></br>


I witnessed at first hand devastation and sickness at its worst (some people younger than me didn’t make it) human bodies (negative) was cross contaminated with positive affected bodies, if you didn’t have it you were “bound” to get it (how about that). And the saying was if you missed this bullet, you could not go back to your work site until you’ve been exposed.</br></br>


Let me tell you in this chaotic situation there was stress in an out of quarantine, stress upon stress here, heck I’m going on 78 years of my life, and it was hell, faith saved the day.</br></br>


Now check this out I did not catch the coronavirus until after the “two” Moderna shots were given me.</br></br>


My shoulder hardened, muscle aches, from the Moderna shot. Now hear this, before I contracted virus I petitioned for my freedom, so that I may fend for myself. With no remorse I was denied, altruism was not considered here (unselfish concern for the welfare of others).</br></br>


My 77 year old body had to suffer the effects of COVID-19. Honey bees, ants all look out for the betterment of, get this, each and every one. All lives matter.</br></br>


So my friends my prayer today is o’Allah so far this day I’ve done well, and when you release me from my burden (prison) and I’m truly awake I’m going to need a lot more “help.”</br></br>


Being that the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine is unapproved, clinical trials cannot be 100% accurate, (faith is good medicine). I say this because serious unexpected side effects may, and do occur because most vaccines are still in clinical trial.</br></br>


Conclusion</br></br>


Holistically speaking we have learned from the coronavirus that the integrated whole has an independent reality which cannot be understood simply through an understanding of its parts: what does all the parts put together want to do?</br></br>


Our obligation must work as a “TEAM” to be fulfilled humanly or divine, and to be successful.</br></br>


Thank you for taking the time to read this letter.</br></br>
