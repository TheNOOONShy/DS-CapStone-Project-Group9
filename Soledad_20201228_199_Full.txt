This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Soledad.</br></br>12/24/2020</br></br>Dear UCI Student,</br></br>I was surprised to get your letter. How you got my information isn't as important as the information you’re requesting. By the way, you sent your letter to me on 12.17.20. I received it on 12.23.20. Thank you.</br></br>So, before I start, just a brief introduction of myself. I’m a 56-year-old African American man. I’ve been incarcerated for 14 years, 8 months, and [redacted]. I’m currently pursuing my AA-T in Sociology. I’m 11 units short of obtaining my degree.</br></br>I’ve never had a write up since my incarceration. Also, I’ve grown as a person. I’ve acquired two skills. The first, I’m a specialty sewer in textiles. Also, I’m a culinary cook at an institutional level.</br></br>I began my prison sentence on a level 4 yard. Now, with some hard work and determination, I’m down to a level 2 yard. Though my points to go to a level one are noticed, I can’t go any lower in housing because of what’s called a hard-19.</br></br>This prevents an inmate from appearing to be non-violent, by preventing the inmate from being housed on a level-1 yard. Thereby giving the inmate an appearance of still being violent, although the inmates behavior is clearly recorded as not being violent.</br></br>Now that I’ve got that out of the way, I’ll try to address the four questions listed in your letter:</br></br>(1) What has it been like to be inside during this time?</br></br> Being in prison, I’ve come to expect at least some form of treatment that tells me and the public that I’m being punished for whatever crimes the court believes I’ve committed. However, at what point does the punishment match the crime?</br></br>Being in prison during the COVID-19 pandemic is no different than being on death-row. Though death doesn’t come immediately, I just wait and hope that some relief would come so I’d be able to live again.</br></br>(2) How do you feel about your safety inside?</br></br>Because of the pandemic the program (movement) is at a halt. This means that I’m locked into a cell with someone who may not be able to cope with the pressures that relate to being in a pandemic.</br></br>Since March, I’ve had three cellies. The last two wanted to take their frustrations out on me. The current one is just as frustrated as the last two.</br></br>I want to rest but I can’t. I pray daily just to be able to get through that day without any incident. Besides the mental breakdowns from cellies, I’ve got to focus on not catching COVID-19.</br></br> Yesterday we finally got a chance for phone calls. After seeing the sanitation efforts through the window, I declined to call home because I didn’t want to jeopardize my health and safety. By the way, I’m a chronic hypertension patient and being an older African American man, I don’t have room to gamble.</br></br>We are allowed to shower every three days. However, this too is a gamble.</br></br>(3) What has it been like to have reduce visitation from family and loved ones?</br></br> When the state looked for early release inmates, they found that the ones they selected had a large percentage of being homeless if released. I am not one of them. I was visited twice a month.</br></br>My loved ones drove at least a bit more than two hours just to visit me. These are not young people. They are in their late 50’s as am I. However, they believe in me as a person.</br></br>They support my conduct and have made provisions for me to succeed in prison and one day soon when I’m released. Being unable to “see” how I’m doing is taking a toll on them. I write them often, as they also write me.</br></br>But the pain of things going from bad, one being in prison, to worse, me having a death sentence is crushing their hopes of me ever being released. This constant stress affects my health and theirs. I ask again, at what point does the punishment match the crime?</br></br>(4) How have you been coping with this crisis?</br></br>As I said before, I’ve been incarcerated for a bit more than 14 years. I was given a sentence of 58 years.</br></br>I began my journey to cope way before the COVID-19 pandemic, way before any panel ordered a state prison population reduction. Way before I had any hope of getting out of prison, I was actively involved with mental health and inmate participation program groups. I’d not only participate in these programs but I’d also become a certified facilitator.</br></br>Groups like anger management, domestic violence, parenting, celebrate recovery, release and re-entry... just to name a few, helped to give me the courage to productively progress through the uncertainty of incarceration.</br></br>Lastly, I cope with this crisis by my faith. Since that first day I was removed from all that I’d known to be my norm, my God has allowed me the grace to get through. Daily I read my Bible and repeat of any and all that I’ve done to get here. Also, I thank God for His constant love and care for me till today. He continues to do so.</br></br> I don’t know how, but I’m grateful to be able to share my story. There’s such a dark stigma when it comes to being an inmate in prison. Sadly, even without a death sentence many of us have to be sentenced as such.</br></br>Sincerely,</br></br>[Redacted]
