This story was told by a person incarcerated at Vacaville.</br></br>

UCI: Oh, how have you been coping with everything and when you had COVID and—</br></br> 

Caller: Listen, I’m still barely getting over everything, you know, because I'm still here, you know. I got very sick, I was in the ICU, not ICU, but I was in the infirmary here where they had me on IVs and all that because my body wasn’t holding no food in, my - they had to feed me through a tube and everything.</br></br>  

UCI: Wow.</br></br>

Caller: Because my body wasn’t keeping no food or anything inside of it. Because I had COVID mixed in with because I had Hep C and then mixed in with the COVID it messed me up really bad.</br></br>

UCI: I'm curious, what the procedure is when someone gets COVID. How soon do they move you to the infirmary or does it just depend?</br></br>

Caller: Honestly, I can say I think it takes a long time. They keep that person in that, in that room they keep them in there isolated. He still comes out to go to interviews and stuff but that's about it.</br></br>  

UCI: Oh, do you, does the facility that you’re at have visitation right now?</br></br> 

Caller: Education?</br></br>  

UCI: Visits. Like visitation.</br></br>  

Caller: No, through the video chat I think they do but I haven’t got one because I’m always on quarantine and stuff.</br></br> 

UCI: Oh. Well, hopefully stuff starts to get better.
