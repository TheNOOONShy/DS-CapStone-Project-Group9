This story was told by a person incarcerated at Soledad.</br></br>

Caller: This place is pretty big. We have three different facilities. One - [unintelligible] 60 inmates, they had about five cases, and now it’s all cleared up.</br></br> 

Another facility, that’s a pretty large one, had a lot of cases, and they kind of stabilized over there. And then there’s another facility that has, active right now, about 35 cases. They had a total of 170, and one guy died. What they do have is we do have N-95 masks.</br></br> 

They do provide hand sanitizer and all the stuff you need to clean yourself. The only bad thing is you’re in your cell for 163 hours a day, I mean, a week, because there is no - the only program they give you is, if you’re a critical worker like you work in the laundry or you work in the kitchen, you go to work. But all the other jobs, they just cease to stop using them, because it’s very limited movement.</br></br> 

So, you’re in your cell all day and during the weekend. You’re in your cell about 163 hours. They give you three hours of recreational yard, and they give you a shower every three days or every 72 hours. Let me think of something else you guys should know.</br></br>

Overall, through the whole prison system is, you do everything in groups. Everyone is congregated. So what happens is a housing unit that’s built for 175 people they have 300 people in it, or 350. A housing unit that’s designed for 127, they got 254 people in there.</br></br> 

So, what it does is, when you go to the shower, and I always use this analogy, if you’re in college, you have a dorm room. Imagine, I live in a bathroom. The toilet’s in there. So, and I live in there with another person. That’s how small it is.</br></br> 

And we’re in there 23, sometimes 24 hours a day, and they bring us our food. It’s - some of the things are, you know, usually what happens in a prison is you’re out of your cell from 6 a.m. to 9 p.m. at night. Under COVID, that’s all gone because they’re operating under a state of emergency.</br></br>
 
Some prisons have a better program, but for about seven months, we didn’t—I shouldn’t say seven months, five months, we didn’t even have an outbreak here, but they had a - they did a raid here, and those officers contaminated these guys. So, because nobody had it here, and then when they did that raid, all these guys came in with no masks on, and got a whole bunch of people sick.</br></br> 

Sort of similar to the San Quentin thing, but it wasn’t about transfers. It was just staff because they’d go home every night.</br></br>

The only other program is canteen and packages. They offered us an extra package because you can only get four a year, but your family goes online to - there’s like four major corporations, which your family can go online, or they have a catalog that they send you. And you can order off your trust account what you need from the package.</br></br> 

The packages can buy your television, your fan, your hot pot. Because everything that you have in your cell, your personal property, you buy, they don’t give anything to you other than state clothes to wear, like jeans, and a shirt, and a pair of shoes.</br></br> 

Tennis shoes, sweats, thermals, soap, coffee, deodorant, toothpaste, everything you buy, you purchase. Either you purchase from the store here, they call it commissary or canteen, and you go by the last two of your number, your CDC number. There’s three times, they call them three draws or draw sequences.</br></br> 

And you need to have people deposit money. If you have restitution, half of that money goes to restitution. So, if you send $100 in, a guy only gets $45. You send $200 in, he only gets $90.</br></br> 

The maximum you can spend in canteen is $220 a month, so most of the money is coming from the street. Same with the packages, they do that by pounds. You can get a 35 - 30-pound package, but your family has to pay, like, say, somebody like Amazon, to get the stuff.</br></br> 

So, basically, for an inmate to survive in here, he’s got to have family members that are sending him a couple hundred dollars every couple of months because the only thing that’s free. They give you food, but the meals are like kid meals, you know, all these guys are grown men, you know, 200-220 pounds, six feet tall, I mean.
