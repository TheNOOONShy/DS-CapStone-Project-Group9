This story was told by a person incarcerated at Riverside County Smith Correctional Facility. 

UCI: What has the COVID situation been like at your facility? You can describe any information from the beginning of COVID or, you know, any information that relevant.</br></br>

Caller: Well, originally when we started wearing masks I was in a call with another guy that had the virus and he wouldn't wear his mask. So, I wore my mask for 24 – I only took it off to eat. And I kept telling them [unintelligible] had the virus. I haven't had it, don't want it. And I said, I'm going to take the shot. And [unintelligible] get the Johnson & Johnson shot. And I got it but I still wear my mask 24/7.</br></br>

It's hard to describe anything. We bunk, we eat at our bunk. We used to eat at the table, but since that virus came we have to eat at our bunk. And there's 24 guys on one side, 24 guys on the other side. And there was six, seven cases of virus in here while I was in here. And they roll them up – they call it roll up – they rolled them out to take care of the problem, I guess. And anyway, any questions that you want answered?</br></br>
