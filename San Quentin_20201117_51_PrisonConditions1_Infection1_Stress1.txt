This letter was written by a person incarcerated at San Quentin.</br></br>

Well, being incarcerated at San Quentin State Prison during this pandemic has been very unsuspecting and scary. Yes, us tough guys get afraid of things too because we are still human beings. During this pandemic, we are aware that we may not survive. To date, 28 prisoners have succumbed to COVID-19.</br></br>

It is impossible to adhere to any of the protective measures recommended by the Center of Disease Control (CDC) or the orders issued by the Warden’s office and the prison Medical Department at San Quentin who instructed us to social distance while placed in a two-man cell so small only one person can actually move at a time. I was told to wash my hands with sanitizer when there is none.</br></br> 

There is no possible way to social distance living in an extremely crowded, overburdened, dimly lit, un-ventilated, and outdated 170-year-old overly retro-fitted facility.</br></br>

I am a level two prisoner, low risk to re-offend who has served 32 years of continued incarceration on a life sentence for a non-homicide conviction as a youth offender appearing before the Board of Parole only once ending in a three-year stipulation induced by my prison appointed counsel. Now I am here suffering COVID-19, WOW! I did not see this coming.</br></br> 

I am not alone in this situation here at San Quentin. There are many young and elderly prisoners here with numerous underlying health conditions who have served just as much and more time as I have. Even the Court of Appeals Ordered Prison Authorities to lower the population to 50% for San Quentin’s Population to have a chance of any possible recovery from this COVID-19 outbreak that was caused by continuing to crown an already overcrowded prison.</br></br>

And transferring people from Chino State Prison for Men where an outbreak had already occurred and placing them here at San Quentin. This move by CDCR led to the death of one corrections sergeant and 28 prisoners and counting here at San Quentin, but CDCR seems to do business as usual.</br></br>

The second thought is: How I feel about my safety. I am scared to maybe death; my family and community are just as afraid because death could result with me and others here if we continue living here in San Quentin in these conditions. This virus is going no where soon.</br></br> 

There is a great possibility that the prisoner’s will die if the government doesn’t take this outbreak seriously, because we’re not on the moon, we are still part of this world and our communities.
