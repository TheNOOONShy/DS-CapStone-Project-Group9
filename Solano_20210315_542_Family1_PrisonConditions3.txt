Dear PrisonPandemic Project,</br></br>

First, I thank you all for the support and hard-work you do for inmates like me. It’s good to know that there are still people who care about us besides our family’s/loved ones. I’ll admit I deserved to be sent to prison for the crimes I did commit, there were so many that I was charged for that nearly cost me my-life though that have no right being on my rap-sheet, and now they’ll be there till the end of time.</br></br>

Our justice system is broke! And because of that I and many others have to spend years in-prison away from the ones we love.</br></br> 

I’m 30 now and still have almost two years to go. I’ve been on the run and locked up since I was just 18. The cops where I’m from think they’re above the law cause of that badge they wear.</br></br> 

They’re so bold they’re telling my family that they’re gonna get me when I get out. Even so bold to ask my counselor when do I get out and told him to tell me they’re waiting for me.</br></br>

That’s a threat and if they didn’t have that badge they’d be in-here with me. Things need to change in our great country. I still love my country even after what happened to me and my family cause I believe in change and it will come one day. I know it.</br></br> 

I also know they’ll always be bad and racist people in this country, but if everything goes good for us that number will be next to nothing. Hopefully sooner than later.</br></br>

Now I know that’s not what you guys are wanting to know about but I wanted to let you know a little about me and let you know that I’m writing a book about me and some of my family’s troubles with the law. So please whoever reads this read my book if I’m lucky enough to get published.
