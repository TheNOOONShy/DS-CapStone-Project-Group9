This story was told by a person incarcerated at Merced County Jail.</br></br>UCI: Okay and then what has the COVID situation been like at your facility.</br></br>Caller: Honestly they haven’t gave us any cleaning supplies or anything. So it’s been very hard for us and we haven’t been able to talk to our families because due to the pandemic they can’t come to come visit us so it's been very hard.</br></br>UCI: And are you able to write and call them still?</br></br>Caller: Yeah we at least get to call and write that’s about it though.</br></br>UCI: Have they given you any like updates or something on whether or not you’ll be able to see them soon or have they just not given you anything at all.</br></br>Caller: No they have not given us anything. And when we write grievances, they just give us responses. It's COVID pandemic and basically they can do whatever they want. So that’s how bad it’s been lately.</br></br> UCI: Yeah. Have you written a grievance before?</br></br>Caller: Huh? Excuse me?</br></br>UCI: Have you given a grievance before to them?</br></br>Caller: Yeah I gave them grievances and they just gave me responses as in like they give us cleaning supplies and give us this and this, but we don’t get none of that.</br></br>UCI: Oh so they don’t actually seem to listen to what your real needs are.</br></br> Caller: Yeah basically just lying and basically you know?</br></br>UCI: Yeah. And have you gotten COVID by any chance? Hopefully not but.</br></br>Caller: No, no, no we haven’t but there has been an outbreak recently, as a matter of fact, we just got COVID tested again. I’ve been COVID tested twice already and got negative but there was an outbreak again right here at the Merced County Jail.</br></br>So they shut everything down, like no programs, no nothing. So, now everything’s back to the way it was and it’s even worse than it was.</br></br> UCI: So you’re completely isolated when there is an outbreak?</br></br>Caller: Yes ma'am.</br></br> 
UCI: Do you have any social interaction with people on a day to day basis or is it just complete isolation?</br></br>Caller: Just complete isolation</br></br>UCI: Alright.</br></br>Caller: Well we only get two phone calls a week so - and we get no visits, nothing basically, we get two phone calls a week and that’s about it.</br></br>UCI: Well I really appreciate that you called us as one of your phone calls. Your story will be made for very great use.</br></br>Caller: Yeah. Alright then, well I have to call my family so I am - I wanted to end it short, so yeah.</br></br> UCI: Oh thank you so much for participating. Please consider telling your friends about us and see if they’d like to call in and I wish you the best thank you so much.</br></br>Caller: Okay, thank you so much bye.
