This story was told by a person incarcerated at Fire Camps.</br></br>

Caller: On the A yard when the COVID outbreak started, which was caused by a corrections officer after some inmates came in and started a riot, he chased them up the stairs, made contact with him physically, made physical contact with inmates that were part of the firefighting training program, and he tested positive for COVID two days later, so those inmates were immediately quarantined.</br></br>

Now the only reason why I personally found out about the quarantine is because after my quarantine, being a level one inmate being put into a level three facility, or section of the facility for quarantine for 14 days, the day we were set to transpac, one of the staff members from Sierra Conservation Center put an inmate that came into contact with the corrections officer, a positive COVID test, was into the Transpac vehicle with us.</br></br>

So, we drove all the way down to Southern California. We drove all the way down to Los Angeles, six and a half hours away, and when we got to the Holton facility, the transport officer received a phone call from the Director of Health from Sierra Conservation Center, saying that we need to immediately distance ourselves from any and everybody and get back in the vehicle and come back to the Jamestown Sierra Conservation Center facility.</br></br>

I was deeply concerned about that decision for a couple of reasons. One, we had made two stops on the way to Los Angeles. One at the Shell Station.</br></br>

Two, we stopped at the truckers stop where we were allowed to get out and use the bathroom and the water fountain, where there were women, children, and teenagers all over the place going into the bathroom right after us and in the line for consumption of water at the water fountain.</br></br>

I made these issues known because we stopped on the way to Holton and on the way back to Jamestown, and utilized these same two facilities both times on the way to and from. And I told the - my counselor, and I wrote a 22 form to the warden.</br></br>

And I 602'd a formal complaint to the facility that I believe that we needed to immediately contact the local health officials so that they could initiate the track and trace program to let these people know that hey, there is a strong possibility that they had been in direct contact with someone who's been in direct contact with COVID-19 per the protocol.</br></br>

UCI: Right.</br></br>

Caller: They refused to respond to my request. And I made multiple complaints about this, and they did nothing about it. So, when we finally got back to Jamestown, you would think that they would put in a proper protocol to isolate us from all the other inmates. No, that's not what they did.
