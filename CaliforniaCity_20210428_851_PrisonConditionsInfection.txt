This letter was written by someone at California City.</br></br>


I’m sorry but my writing skills are very poor, last grade completed was 8th grade so I’m going to try to keep it short and simple. I’m currently serving a 10 year, four month sentence. My E.P.R.D. release date is 3/2027. I’m serving a six year base term plus enhancements, 16 months consecutive enhancement, two year bail enhancement and one year prison prior for a total of 10 years, four months at 85% for first degree burglary. I served one year in Kern County jail, and was released and put on probation for three years.</br></br>


I violated my probation 18 months after my release and now I have to serve the 10 year, 4 months of my joint suspension and it happened to be during the pandemic in county jail. We were getting only one hour a day to shower, make phone calls, and sit in the day room. The rest of the time we were locked in our cells all of our three meals; we had to eat inside our cells.</br></br>


All classes and programs remained closed. I spent 15 months in county jail. I wasn’t able to be transported to prison because of the COVID outbreak in prison until November 2020, when we arrived at prison Wasco Reception Center. We were put in cells, two inmates per cell for 14 days to quarantine. We only got 15 minutes once each week to shower and make a phone call. We had to bird bath in our cells every day.</br></br>


After the 14 days of quarantine were over, we were moved to a non quarantine cell block in two-man cells. There, we got one hour day room for showers, phone calls, and T.V. once a day with no programs available or jobs during Christmas.</br></br> 


I got infected with COVID. I was sick for two weeks -- chills, bodyache, headache, nausea, loss of appetite, and chest pain. I filled out two sick call slips and after 12 days, I got to see the doctor. They realized that I had tested positive a week earlier and that I should’ve been moved to a quarantine building. They gave me some pain meds, allergy, and nausea medicine and moved me that same day.</br></br>


After I recovered from the virus, I was moved to a dorm room. It was much better than being in a cell all day and night in the dorm. We were able to play Dominoes games and watch T.V. I was only there for a few days and then I had to pack to transfer to mainline California City Correctional.</br></br> 


It was the same here when we arrived. We were put in a two-man cell for 14 days to quarantine. After the 14 days, we were moved to a normal cell block, two-man cells. Four cells get to be out one hour a day room at a time for shower, phone, microwave, and T.V. The rest of the 23 hours were in our cells.
