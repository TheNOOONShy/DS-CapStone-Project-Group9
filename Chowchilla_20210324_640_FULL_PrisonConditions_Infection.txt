This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Chowchilla.</br></br>Hello PrisonPandemic,</br></br>Thank you for responding and really at a time of need. I have contracted the corona 19 virus. I’m 53 years old (women) with cirrhosis of the liver. I’m so scared! I have been vaccinated. But that shit didn’t work!</br></br>I feel fine, my bones ache and today my eyes hurt like I’ve been reading too long. And well, maybe I have? That being said, I have no medical attention or help, just locking in a cell. By myself and temperature check two times a day. Wow!</br></br>I have not been tested in over three weeks. I have a negative COVID test from the third of March. But yet on the 18th, they took me to quarantine C yard. No understand?</br></br>I’m only grateful for my release date 5/21 if I live that long. C.C.W.F. medical has put me at high risk level four for release of all inmates at this level. I’ve yet to hear or see that and I’ve filed all, and every paperwork needed for this release.</br></br>Loss the 60 days early to release. In the COs etc., grievance and medical, no response and little to no answers from my grievance. I’m a dying woman in C.C.W.F.</br></br>The COVID medical team have refused to help me. Because I’m so close to leaving, they can’t “they say” any help is better than none right?</br></br> I will be released to a drug treatment center in L.A., C.A.</br></br>Please keep in touch. There are women in the program that have just left prison as well. We could still help your program.</br></br>Thank you.</br></br>P.S. Threw this all I’m bless and highly favored. Sorry for my spelling. It sucks!
