Hello,</br></br> 

My name is [redacted]. I received your note asking me a few questions in regards to COVID-19 and life inside prison?</br></br> 

Well I really don’t have much to say about it. I didn’t get sick, but I know a lot of people who did and even a friend who passed away here!</br></br> 

I’ve been in prison going on 32 years and 20 of those years I was housed at Pelican Bay SHU - solitary confinement. I would really like to know more about this program and, yes, I’d be very happy to share my stories about myself.</br></br> 

This COVID is something I never thought I’d see or experience all these years in prison. It was so random and that in itself brought a lot of uncertainties in my life and those around me.</br></br> 

I want to thank you for your words, and I look forward to hearing more from you and this program.</br></br> 

My best.
