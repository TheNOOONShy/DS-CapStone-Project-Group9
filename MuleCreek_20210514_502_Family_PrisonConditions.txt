This story was told by a person incarcerated at Mule Creek.</br></br>

Caller: Well, well the pandemic, it definitely changed the whole, man, the whole setting in prisons. This is something I’ve never saw before but I been down for nine years. But I seen many people, lot of fights broke out, lots of arguments both from people who’s not wearing a mask and people wearing a mask. Especially at the political moment, like a year ago with the election, upcoming election, you know, like… Wow, I’m a little nervous for some reason.</br></br>

But yeah, I wasn’t able to see my family, my family couldn’t ever come see me at least. My girl, she wasn’t able to come see me. Although she lives in Massachusetts, like she comes out once in a while. But it’s different and it’s takes out of our comfort zone. Like those guys, I been living in my cell for two years with good cellies when this pandemic hit, they kept moving us around to different pods, different cells, different buildings, to different yards and I’ve been in cells with people I don’t know.</br></br>

People were like mentally ill too in my cell, they have us mixed up with those guys. It was uncomfortable but… And experiencing the symptoms, like the heavy breathing and headache and all that with no one to turn to to help or anything like that. It sucked, you know.</br></br>

Plus, I want to, it feels good to talk to my family, you know, but I wasn’t allowed to use the phone, we wasn’t allowed to use the phone, we wasn’t even allowed to leave the cell. So, like, it sucked, you’re just stuck in the cell. Pretty much you’re in the hole. I wasn’t able to write, yeah it was tough.</br></br>

And I’m a student too, I’ve been taking courses, many courses. And at that time, I was a little far behind. I didn’t have much energy to do anything. And they wouldn’t even give us showers every day. They would give us showers like every two or three days. I thought that was important to keep our hygienes clean, like to stay clean but apparently not, at least not in here in CDCR.</br></br>

But all I get is a birdbath, meaning like get a bucket of water, fill it up from the sink, pour a cup over myself over the toilet of course with a privacy curtain because I have five cellies. In this yard, in the yard I’m in, it’s six-man cells. So yeah it’s totally something I’ve never experienced, something I’d never thought I’d see.</br></br>

I had OG cellies that’d been down for three decades, 40 years, and they would explain like, they would express how much this is something that they’d never experienced before. It was crazy how one building, how they flipped, they told everybody in my building to pack up because we’re moving to another yard to one building was [unintelligible].</br></br>

And we all packed and migrated. See we were just walking in straight lines along, about, a long walk to another yard and in line, carrying our stuff. It just felt like a migration, literally, wearing our masks, the staff are wearing their little suit, and it was crazy.</br></br>

But yeah and then there’s a lot of, I see friends breaking up, friends, like, the friendship falters and collapse because of the mask. And at the same time, as I mentioned earlier about the election, the Donald Trump with the mask thing and, and the Biden, all that played a role in it too with the pandemic. And it was crazy. I seen a lot of fights broke out, I seen COs get in fights with inmates and COs amongst each other as well you know. It was crazy.
