This story was told by a person incarcerated at an ICE/Private-Contractor facility.</br></br>
UCI: Talk to me about your story with COVID 19, please.</br></br> Caller: The story isn't personal, but with a neighbor in which I had to look at him very closely and, Thank God, I didn't contract it, but with a neighbor, looking at the beginning of this disease, that is a reality. He would only say "Give me an analgesic or acetaminophen, something, "but really suffering is strong at the beginning, you are starting to fail, feeling very cold and the most surprising is when the sense of smell and taste is lost.</br></br>

So, it's part of being impotent, being close to someone who is going through this and it's totally difficult because these are new diseases in which no one can lead or advise or no one knows what to pay attention to, and only sometimes one grasps some parts of this disease.</br></br> 

UCI: Seriously?</br></br>

Caller: But following some of the information we get from those who are more knowledgeable about this disease, like doctors in general.Sometimes, a person being close to this person who is suffering.</br></br>

UCI: Yes, Yes.</br></br>

Caller: Knowing that you can do is to encourage them to do this or that, although one is not a doctor, but at least not to destroy them the sick person even more. It's very difficult.</br></br> 

UCI: Yes so bad.</br></br>

Caller: Even if you only try by giving Tylenol or a little water.</br></br>

UCI: That's good.</br></br>

Caller: It's something a person can do and well, Thank God, we have information through media like television or radio which helps us orient ourselves even though we are far away. And well, suffering [unintelligible].</br></br>

UCI: Wow.</br></br>

Caller: Is very extreme when it comes to that disease which is a reality. This is part of the experience of observing how this disease or virus damages and attacks.</br></br> 

UCI: One more time?</br></br>

Caller: Excuse me?</br></br>

UCI: One more time, sir?</br></br>

Caller: Yes?</br></br>

UCI: That part, I don't know how to say this, give me a moment. What was that last part?</br></br>

Caller: Well, it's very complicated. The only thing a person must keep in mind is to respect, to know very well what the guidelines are to avoid contagion.</br></br> 

UCI: Yes.</br></br>

Caller: And to distance yourself and help yourself. How? By quickly notifying the people who can care for that person. I am not ready to teach anyone, only to inform what is happening with someone or myself. It could be that-</br></br> 

UCI: Wow.</br></br>

Caller: -the day in which a person can pass through this for the first time, is also complicated.</br></br>

One doesn't want to have this disease, but at a distance, by telephone, families who want to know what is happening present another problem. One has to say "Well, run to the hospital-</br></br>

UCI: Impossible.</br></br>

Caller: -to the doctors."  Someone else says, " No. Don't go because you'll die there." So, then, what happens then? You yourself are deciding.</br></br>

UCI: Good. Good.</br></br>

Caller: That is what I think is the best, encourage them to express all the symptoms and that you love life and keep trying to deal with this disease. And that is the way you can best fight with this pandemic.</br></br>

UCI: Wow. I can't believe your story.</br></br>

Caller: Well, here we are as we continue sharing.</br></br>

UCI: I don't know what to say.</br></br>

Caller: You know what? Pardon my observation, but sometimes you don't even have to go through this illness. Being a humanitarian by watching close up. That is what breaks things and by alerting one another to avoid the expansion of this pandemic.</br></br>

UCI: I'm sorry, Give me a moment. I have a question for you. How has it been for you to have reduced visits and programs and how have you dealt with this crisis? Hello?</br></br>

Caller: Yes. The call was cut off.</br></br>

UCI: Yes? One more time?</br></br>

Caller: Okay. One more time please.</br></br>

UCI: Is there something more you would like the public to know? Yes, sir. Now I'm here. Are you there?</br></br>

Caller: Yes.</br></br>

UCI: One moment. I have a new question for you. My question is is there something more you want the public to know? Yes? Sir?</br></br>

Caller: I didn't understand the last part. I only heard "Would you like" The rest I didn't understand-</br></br>

UCI: Yes. I'm thinking. Give me a moment. Sir, if you have nothing more to add, thank you for participating in the PrisonPandemic. I am ending this call.</br></br>

Caller: [unintelligible].</br></br>

UCI: No. No. Excuse me.</br></br>

Caller: Yes. Yes.</br></br>

UCI: Thank you very much for participating in the PrisonPandemic.</br></br>

Caller: Very good.</br></br>

UCI: And thank you for telling me your story.</br></br>

Caller: Yes, You're welcome.</br></br>

UCI: I wish you a good day.</br></br>

Caller: Likewise.</br></br>

UCI: Take care of yourself.
