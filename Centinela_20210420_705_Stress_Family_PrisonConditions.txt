This story was told by a person incarcerated at Centinela.</br></br>

Caller: I would say, okay, let's see, a lot of people lost their jobs, okay, so financially, for a lot of my fellow inmates here, you know, we don’t really have anything, you know.</br></br>

So, if there were some kind of funds that could be allocated, you know, to the prison or to the prisons in general, some kind of relief packages for low-income individuals or people that don’t get store or people that don’t have anybody that has money to take care of them, you know.</br></br>

That would help out a lot, you know, in the financial aspect, you know, 'cause people are struggling out there, they can’t afford to be taking care of someone that's in prison if they can barely make ends meet themselves with the pandemic, you know. So that’s the financial struggle.</br></br>

And then, let me think, the visitation, I mean, that’s really, the video visits, I mean it sounds good but, I don't hardly hear anybody call for visiting. I’m pretty sure that it's more that just - I’m pretty sure that I’m not the only one that’s waiting for my friends or family members to get approved for visiting.</br></br>

I don’t know what the delay is on that, but it would be nice to see somebody’s face, you know. I mean, I’ve been incarcerated now for almost three and a half years, you know.
