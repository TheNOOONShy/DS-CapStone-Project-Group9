This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Valley State.</br></br>

In January, I was with four people who were coughing and sneezing every minute. And the nurses knew that they were feeling bad and needed attention. I didn’t know what to do, only trying not to get too close to them, cover everything one uses; plates, spoons, cups, and even the clothes one wears daily.</br></br> 

I wash it daily with the liquid they give us to clean the floor.</br></br>

I know that the material that one has differently every month. I bless it and thank God that I haven’t gotten sick. Because only that liquid is the one that they give us, we don’t have soap, not even the ones that are cheap. Even the masks they gave us are used.</br></br> 

What can one do, but wait for a miracle from the lord. Now this year, we have faith in the new president. Since I am catholic, I believe in God and the virgin of Guadalupe, I know that soon there will be a vaccine for everyone.</br></br>

I will come out in the future, because the desperation is like we have COVID-19. The desperation of being incarcerated in a cold dark cell. Alone without seeing anyone, without knowing if your kids find themselves in good health.</br></br>

I have been so close to hurting myself, only because it’s been months without knowing about my kids. There are days when I finish my quarantine, I have a chance to be able to talk on the phone with the lady that I have two daughters with.
