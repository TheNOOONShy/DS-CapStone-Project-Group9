UCI: And how - how do you think COVID-19 has been handled by your facility, I mean, since the beginning of the outbreak?</br></br>Caller: Well, that - that's in numerous ways, you know, all the self-help programs have stopped because of social distancing and they're not allowing volunteers into the prison.</br></br>All of the vocational programs have stopped. And any in-college classes that we had had going on that - that at least for this facility had - that had just started to ramp up, those are all - those have all been shut down.</br></br>So you really only have as far as, like, self-improvement wise is correspondence college courses going on. Everything else is at a standstill.
