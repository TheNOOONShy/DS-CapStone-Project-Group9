Thank you for letter. Will try to share briefly my story about my stay here at jail.</br></br>

How been like inside since pandemic started? Was calm situation, some people been released (depends on level of cases). Some people had COVID, but they been separated from GP immediately.</br></br>

Visits have been canceled. There was no visits for full year. Vaccinations just recently started from middle of March. We have no hot meals since last year and OCSD they only promise about to restore hot meal.</br></br>

There is no social distancing - six feet - our bunks staying about four feet of some areas, and less than food in other areas. We do constantly getting checked for COVID. So far no one have any symptom.</br></br> 

I feel safe so far.
