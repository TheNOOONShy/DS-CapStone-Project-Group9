UCI: So you said you were coping with this, you were going to the gym and working out, so, the gym, were they-</br></br>

Caller: Well there’s, honestly, there is no gym, we have no gym. But like, just doing push-ups, burpees, or like stuff like that, know what I mean, in my cell. ‘Cause right now I’m currently, we’re in-it’s like a pod. It’s a 16-man pod, no, there’s 16 cells, two people in each cell, and and we only get three hours of dayroom.</br></br> 

And the rest we spend inside our cells, with, it’s me and my other cellmate.</br></br>

UCI: Oh, okay.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah.</br></br>

UCI: And, so what do you think would’ve made the situation, like, at your facility better? Either with family, like visitation or calls, or cleaning, any of that.</br></br>

Caller: Honestly overall, I think they’ve been handling it good but  but honestly if things were better, you know what I mean, or if I could add something there, you know what I mean I wish there was more visitation. ‘Cause there was no visitation for a whole year for these guys in Orange County jail. And for a whole year there was no visitation, and that really, you know what I mean?</br></br> 

Kinda roughed up a couple guys in here, know what I mean, they were kinda getting sad and depressed, and, getting in their depression mode, and you know what I mean. So I kinda felt bad for those guys, but yeah.</br></br>

UCI: So now that they’re allowing visitation, are there certain rules in place for that?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, there’s like, you know what I mean, you gotta make an appointment, you gotta check in, if you’re late for your appointment, even like two minutes late, you know what I mean, it’s a wrap. You can’t go up to your visit, you know what I mean and it’s only a 30 minute visit, and that’s it. It’s only like two visits per month, for right now.
