This story was told by a person incarcerated at Solano.</br></br>

Caller: Well, the current situation is we had an outbreak about two weeks ago because they brought in a busload of people from Old Folsom, which had an outbreak there. And we didn't have no cases. We maybe had one or two in and out here and there. But once they brought these guys to our building Ð and some of them told us straight out of their mouths that they weren't even quarantined.</br></br>And all of the buildings that they put these guys in, there was an outbreak. And now they have all these guys testing positive. We're over 100 cases now here at Solano. So, we're being placed in a gymnasium that's filthy. The stucco from the roof is falling down. There's dust everywhere. There's dirt all on the floor. We're not six feet apart. It's just filthy, and it's not even ventilated properly.</br></br>And they've got mice running around in here. We've got roaches up in here. It's terrible.</br></br>UCI: I'm really sorry to hear that.</br></br>Caller: Yeah. And I lost my smell. I lost my taste. It's freezing in here.</br></br>UCI: When did you find out you were positive with COVID?</br></br>Caller: So, they've been Ð we've been testing multiple times, and we have a bunch of negatives.</br></br>And then I guess we supposedly have a positive, but nobody actually came out and told us. The officers had to tell us before the medical staff even told us, and we still haven't gotten papers that actually say that we are positive. But we got all the negative papers, but they wouldn't give us the positive papers for some reason.</br></br>UCI: Hmm.</br></br>Caller: So, how we found out actually was they Ð the police came to my cell because they moved me over to the quarantine because somebody in my dorm had tested positive.</br></br>And so then what they did was they rolled up our whole dorm and took us over to the level three side and threw us in a cell. From my understanding, when you're in those cells, we don't have the proper ventilation for the virus to escape through the vents. There is no ventilation system. The air just circulates in there. So, everybody that they're sending to this cell situation are coming up positive. And then they're taking us and they're moving us to the gymnasium.</br></br>So, the officer comes to my door, and he says, "Hey, man, pack up."</br></br>And I'm like, "Where am I going?"</br></br>He says, "You're going over here because you've got a positive." And that's just one positive supposedly. So, nobody has come around and did a double test.</br></br>Now, I heard something about an influenza test that would give us a false positive where they just do the rim of our nose, and then I heard Ð and they did the one before where they went all the way up our nose, all the way up in our cranium, so far up there. Have you heard anything about that?</br></br>UCI: I unfortunately haven't. I'm sorry.</br></br>Caller: The two tests are different. You know how they do the rim of your nose and then they go further up your nose?</br></br>UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>Caller: Yeah. So, once they started doing the rim of our nose, all of these people started coming back positive. I don't know. I don't know if that's a correlation or some type of connection. But this is what we're experiencing right now.</br></br>UCI: And how have you been coping with all of this? How have you been handling it?</br></br>Caller: Well, I just read, and I meditate. I'm lucky I'm able to call my family and share with them what's going on and kind of get it off my chest like that. Otherwise, you can't do too much. You don't want to do too much.</br></br>UCI: And then if you wouldn't mind maybe just walk me back in time. When did the outbreak begin?</br></br>Is it different now than it was maybe at the beginning of COVID back in March?</br></br>Caller: Well, the difference from now, Solano, for a long time we didn't have outbreaks and we didn't have too many cases until they started transferring people in from New Ð Old Folsom around, let me see, maybe three weeks ago or maybe a little longer.</br></br>And then that's when we started having cases. And then last week we had our first case in our building. But before that, another building, the 24 building, had an outbreak just in that building, and they isolated that whole building, took all of those guys out and put them in quarantine, and then rotated them back to the yard and back to the other building.</br></br>And once they rotated them back, then that's when the outbreak happened in the 23 building and then isolated in the other buildings. But there's maybe 40 guys left over in the 23 building right now. So, all this happened last week.</br></br>UCI: That sounds like quite a crazy, stressful situation. I'm sorry. How has this been affecting your loved ones?</br></br>Caller: Say it again?</br></br>UCI: How has the COVID situation at your facility and with you, how has it been affecting your loved ones?</br></br>Caller: Sorry, one more time?</br></br>UCI: How has what's going on with you in Solano, how has it been affecting your loved ones?</br></br>Caller: Oh, it's terrible. Of course, they fear for my life, and they fear for my safety. And of course my wife misses me terribly and wants to visit me, and friends and family can't do that.</br></br>So, everybody, they're afraid because they know there's so many people. It's so overcrowded in here that when an outbreak happens in a prison, there's no way they can isolate the person or the people that they come in contact with, especially in an open dorm with ten or 12 people in a small dorm. It's not possible. So, they worry about me a lot.</br></br>UCI: Yeah, it must have been very hard to not have visitation all this time.</br></br>Caller: Yes, and I've been going to Ð I've been married now. I just had my tenth anniversary, and I've been going to visitation for ten years consistently almost every weekend. And then all of a sudden just nothing. In the beginning, they started to Ð they had a pilot program where they were going to do the video camera thing, and I guess the video cameras didn't work. They had some technical difficulties.</br></br>So, they scrubbed that, and now Ð they're just now bringing it back. My wife was going to get a visit for next weekend, but she can't because now I'm on quarantine. So, I haven't seen her except through pictures and stuff.</br></br>UCI: I'm so sorry. And congratulations on the ten years.</br></br>Caller: Thank you. And thank you for hearing my story and hearing what's going on in here. Yeah, I had seen the number, and I was just like, "I've got to say something." It's just not right.</br></br>UCI: We really appreciate you calling. Is there anything else you want people to know about your experience?</br></br>Caller: I think I covered it all. It's just the fact that it seems like they're not taking every precaution, especially physically. They could at least clean this place up. They've got the backboard. It's so much dirt and just old gunk stuck to all the lights and everything, and the floor is filthy.</br></br>They could take a lot more precautions in making this place a little bit more cleaner and safer, especially with the outbreak.
