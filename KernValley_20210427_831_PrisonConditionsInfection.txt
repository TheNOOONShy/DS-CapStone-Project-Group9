This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Kern Valley.</br></br>

I don't know what to write to you about you can always watch "Lockdown" on the National Geographic channel it's all fake and lies. Prison is generally a house of pain and misery. Ironically you're surrounded by people 24/7 yet you're the loneliest person in the world.</br></br>

Please forgive my grammatical, spelling, and language errors. Since all the people I write now are people I'm familiar with, my writing has grown very liberal with swearing and grammar has been thrown to the birds. Even my lawyers are used to my transcript-like style of writing.</br></br>

First and foremost I'd like to say thank you for writing a total stranger and giving some positive hope a currency very short in my current environment. I hope that COVID-19 hasn't negatively impacted your life in any way. Basically I hope that you and yours are safe.</br></br>

Honestly I'm safer in here from COVID-19 than the average citizen outside these walls. If the staff hadn't brought the virus in from outside we'd all have been virus-free. I've been vaccinated already although I was hesitant to get it, 'cause all the doomsday zombie movies always begin with some miraculous medicine or medical procedure. I'm not a zombie yet so it must be okay!</br></br>

But in this enclosed environment you can imagine how quickly it spread once it was in the walls. I never caught it and multiple tests were negative, what made it miraculous was my cellmate had it but even though we're locked up together in a 8'x12' cell he never passed it on. So, it is possible not to get it, so please follow mask and hygiene protocols.
