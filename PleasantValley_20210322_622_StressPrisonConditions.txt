This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Pleasant Valley.</br></br>

I never thought that my life would become so complicated overnight. I remember waking up early in the morning and turning on the TV. It was really scary!</br></br>

Seeing this virus break all the rules in the book. It respected no one! Our age, ethnicity, and professional background didn't matter.</br></br>

This virus was causing chaos and panic. Especially in prison. It was hard for me to go to sleep that night and being locked up made it 3 times worse!</br></br>

I couldn't just go and be with my family and those who I care very much about. I was afraid of the uncertainty of the things to come.</br></br>

I wasn't the only prisoner who felt this way, of course! As a small community in prison, we all knew each other, and felt each other's pain and fear! I honestly thought that they, CDCR, were going to implement new strict rules and regulations for all inmates.</br></br>

I guess I was just feeling optimistic because as months went by, things were the same. Every program was running normal like if nothing was wrong out there in our community. I became very worried for all our safeties.</br></br>

These correctional officers didn't mind wearing their own masks. While us prisoners walked around without anything covering our faces. We couldn't do much!</br></br>

And our voices were far from being heard. Now things got worse and people started to get sick in here. I guess things are finally starting to change a little.
