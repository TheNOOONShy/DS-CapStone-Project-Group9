This story was told by a person incarcerated at Mule Creek.</br></br>


Caller: Oh, okay. Well, there you have it. But anyway, in regards to the COVID-, my COVID experience, you know it's actually overbearing — more so overbearing like during the month of October, November of last year. At the end of November I actually caught it. And I caught it based on the fact I was in a particular housing unit where the canteen workers were also housed.</br></br>


And two weeks prior to the outbreak at that particular-, at this particular facility, well I stayed at that one, because now I moved up or down to the lower yard though it's still considered on the same compound at Mule Creek. The individuals who were assigned to canteen were inmates, were quarantined for 10 days because their boss, whom they were in close contact with, was sick.</br></br>


He was exposed-, was diagnosed with having COVID-19. However, their boss came back, they returned back to work, and then maybe a week later an outbreak occurred in the particular unit that I was at and it started in my unit.</br></br> 


I was-. My situation is this. As your brief notification that was received by your organization-, that was sent out by your organization, it's, you know, discussed or required that we discussed the safety that we're now, you know, issued, and not been able to do because of this. Because it's known that staff-, we contracted them at the, excuse me, through staff. Right?</br></br>


I mean we had no other way to get it. And then due to their negligence and their indifference they began to transfer inmates who also, you know, exacerbated the infection rate [unintelligible] the prison inside of California, right? However, even when we consider the unfortunate deaths, as we see on TV now we-, there is no degree of, you know, I want to say, accepting-. Oh, excuse me. A level of comfort I should say in my understanding of their safety.</br></br>


Not only because of that, but when you look at the decision tactics which police and law enforcement agencies use almost in every aspect, you know? You have some level of, you know, grave affect due to their negligence and indifference. As we've seen just yesterday they were finally able to convict somebody from a law enforcement-, of a law enforcement agent based on the, you know, the death that occurred and the acts they committed towards George Floyd, you know?</br></br>


And so, the atmosphere in here, now, is rather sketchy and edgy because we don't know when this-, another outbreak can occur. Because as they are requiring that we wear our masks, they're not always wearing theirs. And so that can create another outbreak, you know? And so, in regards to the area of safety, man. I mean, there's many of us who have some concern in that department for many reasons outside of just a potential COVID infection that may again, you know,` ensue.
