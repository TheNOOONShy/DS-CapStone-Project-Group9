This story was told by a person incarcerated at Chuckawalla.</br></br>

UCI: And what is the current COVID-19 situation at your facility?</br></br>

Caller: Ridiculous. Pretty much within the last month, my entire yard has been exposed. They, I just personally just got over it a couple of weeks ago. They put me in central medical for four, five days.</br></br> 

Pretty much treated me like I was in the hole. And they put me in a building with another hundred and some odd inmates that were, also had COVID as well. There’s no quarantining process.</br></br> 

Like, there was no really legitimate quarantining process. They just had us in an open dorm, you know? Walking around, mingling amongst all of us. They took our vitals twice a day, more or less in my opinion for show more than really for any medical purposes.</br></br>

And then before we even were technically tested to see if we had COVID anymore or not, as long as we stopped showing symptoms for 14 days from the day that they quarantined me, took me back to my original building.</br></br> 

UCI: So they didn’t even give you a second test to determine if you didn’t have COVID-19?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, no. Once I tested positive, they stopped testing me.</br></br> 

UCI: And when you say that they treated you like you were in the hole, what did you mean by that?</br></br>

Caller: It felt more like I was on a disciplinary action than just being sick. You know?</br></br>

Caller: Like the entire time from, they were checking our temperatures twice a day. And when it hit me my temperature was high, and from that second when they made that call to take me from this building and put me in central medical, they, there was about 10 officers who were in the building.</br></br>

I was delirious. I was, you know, I was very dizzy and discombobulated. They were telling me I had to leave. I was panicking about college work that I needed to bring with me.</br></br>

We were arguing. It was a big scene. They took me out, locked me in a cell pretty much, and the doctor would come and check me periodically. I was vomiting everything up. I didn't eat for days.</br></br> 

The doctor came in and said I could have a Pedialyte, and they didn't bring me that Pedialyte for probably four or five hours after that moment, and I'd already been beyond throwing up food and stomach acid and everything else. Me asking four different people to bring me that first bottle of Pedialyte.</br></br> 

When I asked for something soft and easy to digest to give myself nutrients like a booster and Ensure, they said to me that I could have another Pedialyte, and that was it. The whole thing, they gave me two Pedialytes, that was it.</br></br> 

UCI: So how was COVID-19 handled at your facility at the beginning of the outbreak?</br></br>

Caller: Very lightly. They have an announcement on the intercom system like five times a day about “We’re all in this together. And we should all wear masks.”</br></br> 

And half the time I see officers not wearing masks, the time we got sergeants that pretty much hate us as inmates and just yell at us just to yell at us. It’s not even about actual safety precautions, it’s just an excuse to ride our asses about anything.</br></br> 

UCI: So is it being handled differently now?</br></br>

Caller: No. We’re actually doing the exact same thing, and as traumatic as an experience as I just went through. I perso- strongly feel that within 90 to 120 days, whenever I’m susceptible to get this virus again, I’m going to go through the exact same debacle.</br></br> 

I was just going to say the other yards that are already going through this again, on their second wave, they’re doing the exact same thing they did last time they got it.
