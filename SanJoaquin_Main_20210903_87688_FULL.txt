<em>This story was told by a person incarcerated at San Joaquin County Jail.</br></br></em> 

UCI: Thank you. And did you have something you wanted to say?</br></br>

Caller: I just had a little story I wrote. I've been calling the past few days in a row. I'm giving you guys a different story every day as I've written a few of them.</br></br>

UCI: Yes.</br></br>

Caller: In the past, I've given you guys one that I called Faith in Humanity. And then yesterday, I read off one that I just called My Story because it's my life story leading up to me being here in jail and all that.</br></br>

UCI: Yes. I would love to hear it.</br></br>

Caller: Today, I just finally completed one I've been working on. It's brand new. It's titled Why We Love, and I'll go ahead and read that off to you. And I apologize if I struggle with it.</br></br>

I kind of struggled with this one a little. It was harder than I expected it to be, and the wording might be a little off here and there. But I'll do my best to read through it and to have it make sense for you guys. So, if you want, I'll start now.</br></br>

UCI: Yes, go ahead. I'm excited to hear it.</br></br>

Caller: Okay. Thank you. All right. So, it goes - now, this one, I should start out saying, this one, I was stuck about love floating around in my head. And I really didn't know what I wanted to say or how I wanted to say it.</br></br> 

So, I first titled it, and then I just started writing from there. So, I titled it Why We Love, then I just started going from there without really knowing what I was going to say or how I was going to say it. So, here it goes.</br></br>

So, in starting this summary of sorts, I really have idea of what I'm about to write, as I seem to have more doubts and more questions rolling around in my head [due] direction or answers. But perhaps that one [unintelligible] is part of the beauty of what's written in the end. Okay, I've already started cheering up now.</br></br> 

That's a promising sign that this has the potential of being a good [one], as I have cried my way through every story I've written in the past, and I feel they have ended up fairly decent as I've made my best efforts to [unintelligible] by way of the use of the English language.</br></br>

Please, do have yourself a nice read-through here as I sit aimlessly on a 24-hour lockdown for over 20 days now with at least ten more to go thanks to [unintelligible] COVID-19. I'll be trying to finish out a six-month sentence [unintelligible]. But that will soon be explained later in this tale as I explain how love put me behind bars for a crime where I am the only victim.</br></br>

I'm telling you about the first time I felt love. I had just turned 26 years old, finishing out the last summer I would ever know free from genuine responsibility and true purpose in this life. He was ten pounds and six ounces and was the most precious thing I'd ever known. Finally, I had felt the connection to something so deep, it was boundless as it had no barriers or limits as to what I would do for this love I felt towards this small baby, including give my life for his.</br></br> 

With the purity of it all, that's exactly what I did. I started by building him a family, bringing more and more love into this world by having three babies in three years time and then a fourth baby a few years later.</br></br>

I even married his mother immediately after his birth, knowing that it was now my wholehearted responsibility to take of this family even though my relationship with his mother was simply one of convenience at best. Convenient for her that when her mother threw her out at the age of 16, I gave her a stable place to live as I had already begun a career that would earn me almost $5 million by the age of 40. And convenient for me that I was working 12 hours a day, seven days a week, working hard labor, and I simply never had the time or concern of seeking out the perfect woman for me.</br></br> 

Plus I was able to forgo the suffering of breaking her heart even though the two of us clearly weren't meant for each other, with me giving everything to the cause and her mostly worrying about herself. Only now I can see how wrong it was of me to not take these matters seriously, because eventually it destroyed the life I worked so hard to build for us.</br></br>

After 20 years of expanding my business to an unprecedented level far beyond my wildest expectations while also maintaining a relationship with this woman, it became very frustrating that, instead of living this happily ever after that was there for the taking, instead we were always spiraling in drama due to the fact that my partner in life was more of a liability than an asset.</br></br> 

She rarely cooked or cleaned. And if she did, her version of laundry would be, every time I looked at the washer and dryer, there would be a load sitting in the dryer that I needed to fold, even though by now it was all wrinkled, along with a load in the wash that had been needing to be dried for the past eight hours now and probably had to be rewashed.</br></br>

If she vacuumed, I would come home to a vacuum sitting out in the middle of the floor with the cord running all over, needing to be wrapped up and put away by me, or else it would sit there for the next three days or more. If she did dishes, she would just barely rinse the dishes and throw it in the dishwasher as if it actually washed the dishes for you rather than just sanitized your fairly-clean dishes, as it really only does.</br></br> 

So, we always had food stuck in the dishes. I enjoyed her cooking, but she would only cook a few times a week. Her efforts were so halfhearted, but it was her alcoholism and her drug use and the way she would treat my children that made it an unstable living environment for my family.</br></br>

There were two main reasons being why I held onto this unhealthy relationship at least ten years longer than I should have, with one being that I wanted so badly to let my kids grow up in that all-American nuclear family lifestyle with both Mom and Dad always right there for them, as I never had that. And I will tell you, growing up in a quiet house often alone, it brought me such joy to come home to this house full of people, this family I produced. I would often sit there quietly, excuse me.</br></br>

UCI: Hey, no. You were doing a beautiful job.</br></br>

Caller: Oh, good. Oh, yeah. This is a tough one to read through. Okay. I'll start over with that sentence. I would often sit there quietly and listen to the laughter and the voices of my loved ones emanating through the house.</br></br> 

It gave me such a sense of accomplishment and completion deep in my soul. The second reason now being that I had indeed facilitated so many good times and even better memories with this family, having taken them on so many vacations and trips to the lake to jet ski and camping and days at the park and even Chuck E. Cheese and the mall. I can never even count them all.</br></br>

At some point, you don't want to let go of the only other adult that was there with you for all these wonderful times. For people that are in these long-term dysfunctional relationships, it almost becomes like it's own prison, where you naturally want to be able to grow old and hold on to those memories and be able to share them with the only other adult that was present - even if you hate each other.</br></br> 

It becomes a matter of, by leaving that person, you're leaving behind a huge part of yourself and your life. And it requires a great strength to do so.</br></br>

I eventually came up with a plan to meet somebody new. And if I developed feelings for this person, well, then I could use those feelings to give me the strength I needed to pull away from the pain I was in by being in this relationship. Otherwise, I knew I would just stick it out for the kids no matter what. And that's exactly what I did.</br></br> 

I met a girl through my family, and perhaps I forced myself to feel like I had fallen in love with her in order to finally leave my wife. In a way, I sort of crowbarred this new woman into my life, overlooking her troubled past when I definitely should have taken that more seriously. And by doing so, I wound up taking on the flaws and deviant behaviors and ways of her previous years before me.</br></br>

I directly took on the brunt of her evil ways with her spiraling back into behaviors unlike anything I has ever experienced as she conjured up some of her past relationships while also starting new ones all around me, which all led to her attempting to take my life three times by using other men to do it in efforts to get me out of the picture and keeping as much of my stuff as possible. I once found a text message in her phone referencing me as being a sponsor in her life, helping and allowing her to maintain this illustrious lifestyle, drugs, and men.</br></br>

Fortunately, I don't die easy and seem to easily overcome anything that comes my way. I shrug off death like a small cold or like COVID-19, as I have maintained doing 500 pushups and walking ten miles a day throughout the entire time that I've been infected. I try not to let anything slow me down, but this only frustrated her as she finally succeeded in removing me by informing the police of where to find a firearm in my house that she was responsible for it being there as I felt that I needed to protect myself and my family with her sending men my way to shoot me with the pistol she armed them with.</br></br>

I was arrested when the police came and searched my house again. And I'm now here in jail, infected with COVID-19 and fighting a two-year sentence. Meanwhile, she made off with about $40,000 worth of my belongings.</br></br> 

I've been served with restraining order papers while being in here to secure her peace of mind that I won't come after her for the items she stole when I get out of here, including a brand new car I bought. She's great at being wicked as she works the system as her own puppet to do her bidding, caring not for the fact that I have also now lost my house and forcing my four young children to be homeless until I get out of here.</br></br>

UCI: If you need to take a couple seconds so you could breathe, go for it, please.</br></br>

Caller: I'm good, thank you. I stare at these walls every day, defeated and heartbroken at the thought of my youngest son, at the age of eight years old, tells me every day that I'm the best dad in the whole world and how much he loves me, is completely out of my reach. Luckily, they're in care of my mother.</br></br>

For me, I can separate the love I feel in my heart three ways. I have the love I feel towards the entire world around me, including everything and everyone in it. And then there's the overpowering love I feel towards my children that feels like it could be stronger than the bond that holds together the individual atoms that make up our entire Universe.</br></br> 

And then, finally, there is what has been for me this elusive form of love that would give one's self a sense of completion of being whole, a love you would share with your soulmate and life partner, the best friend you could ever have as you truly take care of one another and watch out for each other, that person that means so much to you that it could feel as if the day never even happened if you don't have them to come home to and tell them about it, that special kind of love I feel slightly broken and incomplete without, a love that I have been so thirsty for for over 20 years now. And life has been a bit of a struggle without it.</br></br>

I like to use the metaphor or symbolism of my life having been equivalent to the continent of Africa and with love being the equivalent of a cold drink of water. In my mission to cross this great desert in search of its treasure, there have been a couple times where, during this journey, I had thought I saw an oasis up ahead. But when I arrived, it turned out to be a mirage, and all I got was a face full of sand. I was already thirsty when I began this journey. And now having nearly crossed the entire continent, I almost feel like I will soon die of thirst.</br></br> 

I can only hope that when I reach the other side, I will find that special someone having been waiting for me there the whole time. And with that in mind, it gives me true appreciation for what's been the tragedy of the relationships I have endured. Because when I finally make it to that special someone, it will feel like Heaven on Earth every day I'm alive for the rest of these days forward, as I will have a true appreciation and understanding of the value of the love we will share.</br></br>

I now know in my heart that, until the day I find myself comfortably laying in bed with my arms wrapped around the woman I love, that I will never completely be at home. This journey of mine has been long and hard as I so desperately want to finally just find my way home. I wish to embrace the love that will rejuvenate and restore balance and order to my life.</br></br>

So, in gaining a better understanding as to why we love, I'd say it's because it's love in our lives that we all consider to be our homes. And we want to be and deserve to be home, as home is where the heart is.</br></br>

And that's the end of that one.</br></br>

UCI: Thank you so much for sharing your story. You put so much thought into --</br></br>

Caller:	Pleasure.</br></br>

UCI: It's great to hear. I'm so thankful and grateful to hear your story. The whole organization is so grateful for all your calls and all your stories.</br></br>

Caller: Oh, thank you so much. It means a lot to me to hear that. And I mean it's like doing what you guys are doing there almost makes it feel like you've given me some purpose in this world, because I mean these stories would otherwise just sit in my sock drawer and collect dust, and I would never know what to do with them. So, I thank you very much for that.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah. So, we love hearing your stories. We are so glad that we are giving you a purpose, and it was truly a beautiful story.</br></br>

Caller: Oh, thank you so much. Yeah, I struggled with that one. I wasn't sure if the wording came out right. That was my first official read-through, you know? Yeah, it seemed to be okay. I think it came out okay, [chuckles] decent.</br></br>

UCI: It came out more than okay. It was beautiful.</br></br>

Caller: Oh, thank you. Yeah. I was a couple pages in after yesterday, and then I just started in with the rest of it last night and through this morning and had it ready for you here at seven o'clock. I'm glad you were able to take my call.</br></br>

UCI: Of course. And we're so glad that you did call to share.</br></br>

Caller: And I guess you guys only operate Monday through Friday. So, I'll have the better part of the weekend here to rewrite, because I've got to copy some of these things off my tablet. The only form I have of them is emails I sent on my tablet through to my ex-girlfriend. And they don't exist otherwise.</br></br> 

So, I'm having to re-transcribe them off the tablet onto paper so I can read them to you guys. So, by Monday, hopefully, I'll have another couple ready for you. I still have The Proof, which is a really good one, and then also The Immaculate Concept of the Power of Good, which really love. I'll try to get those ready for you next week --</br></br>

UCI: Of course. Of course.</br></br>

Caller: - and go from there. All right. Well, thank you so much, and I really appreciate what you guys are doing. I'll talk to you guys soon.</br></br>

UCI: Thank you. Thank you so much for calling and sharing.</br></br>

Caller: You're welcome. My pleasure. Bye-bye.</br></br>

UCI: Bye-bye.</br></br>
