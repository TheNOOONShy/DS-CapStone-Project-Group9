UCI: Absolutely. So, did you get comfortable with, you know, yourself getting vaccinated through friends and family, through media? How did you decide to get vaccinated then?</br></br> 

Caller: A lot of it has to do from, you know, things I read in the newspaper, the benefits. Again, I have pre-existing medical conditions that could potentially lead to my death if I was contract the coronavirus.</br></br> 

So, it was a lot of distrust for the sheriff being behind it but at the same time I just felt like, you know, I had to take the risk. Because I was already in so much risk as it was. You know, there was over, close to over fifteen-hundred people tested positive for COVID. And I was around close to 10 of them in a sixteen cell sector.</br></br> 

So, I felt that I was already in a lot of risk and danger. So, I just went for it and took the vaccine. I know, like I said, there was no education, nobody came and told me what was going on. They just said do you want the vaccine, yes or no?</br></br> 

And I took it, then 21 days later I took the second dose.</br></br> 

But, yeah I mean, it was, a lot of it had to do with just me going for it and hoping that whatever I was getting would not hurt me. But I know that a lot of guys in here just don’t feel like this is the place to get the vaccine. And they prefer, I know many guys have said, “Hey, I’ll wait ‘til I’m released because I really don’t want to get it in here.</br></br> 

And it’s sad because, you know, there’s people in here who really need the vaccine and who would really benefit from the vaccine. But it just goes to show that this department is not one that people trust. And, you know, just it’s a horrible feeling when you’re sitting here watching on TV how the sheriff, you know, generalizes everybody. Puts everybody into one group and stops referring to you as anything other than “those public safety threats.”</br></br>
