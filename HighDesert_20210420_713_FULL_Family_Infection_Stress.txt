PrisonPandemic Program UC Irvine,</br></br>

Hello. I’m a 40-year-old man serving 13 years. The COVID-19 pandemic has been quite the experience. I’m Christian, so faith in the supernatural God is something that I carry with me.</br></br>

My year started in March 2020. At the early stages when the requirements were set in place. We got locked down. Segregated and our daily program was disrupted.</br></br> 

The staff here at the prison began handing out face masks, which I thought was odd because I didn’t have a television set to watch the daily news.</br></br>

Later that month, my mother alerted me that my father-in-law had passed away. He actually passed away December 18th. But because I am in prison, my mom worries about my emotional composure. Sadly they thought it was the flu and claimed that the vaccine gave him a bad reaction.</br></br> 

We later found out that it was COVID-19. It was a tragedy, my 10 year old lost her grandad. On the surface she was handling it well, but I was devastated when I got the news.</br></br>

So things were slowly building momentum. Our daily program was set on the COVID-19 regulations. We socially distanced ourselves, routine testing began going around. Then somehow the virus made it into the prison; we believe through either an infected officer or a transferred inmate from another prison.</br></br> 

So regular testing began, finding outbreaks in different areas. The facility has maybe six different yards: A, B, C, D, E, F, and I-unit, which is the ad-seg, or the hole. Medical staff had a very serious situation in their hands. It was a coronavirus outbreak in the High Desert State Prison.</br></br>

I don’t know much of legal matters but we were exposed just through faulty ventilation systems. The mail here at the prison has a delay. So if we tested on Monday. We wouldn’t have results till a week later.</br></br> 

Also we were in isolation. Picture two people in a small cell. One gets infected but is asymptomatic so he doesn’t get quarantined on time, and it spreads like wildfires.</br></br>

I was scared, my celly, an African-American named [redacted], was down for three days with a sore throat and flu-like symptoms. Well once I knew I was asymptomatic, I moved over to a new cell with another Mexican who had a very bad cough and was placed on an electric respirator. I mean the guy was dying, for lack of a better word.</br></br>

I was scared. I was so afraid for that I lifted a medical grievance. I have a lot to talk about. I was impacted by this because he was forced to spend the night alone in a cell in the seven most critical days, coughing profusely. The whole dorm witnessed it.</br></br>

I’m pursuing a grievance against CDCR for exposure to COVID-19 and accountability. The doctors worked around the clock but I witnessed a cover-up, all caught on film. And because I journal, I documented the officer purposely leaving his property behind.</br></br> 

I wish someone could help me legally. And perhaps alerting the media! I’ll be awaiting your response.</br></br>

In Jesus name,</br></br>

God bless you</br></br>

PS. Remember Donald Trump took a trip to North Korea? How much after that visit was COVID-19 released in China? Something to think about.
