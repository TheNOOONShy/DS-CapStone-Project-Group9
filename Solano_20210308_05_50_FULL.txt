This story was told by a person incarcerated at Solano.</br></br>

UCI: Okay, so tell me about your experience.</br></br>

Caller: It hasn’t been a good one.</br></br> 

UCI: Mmhmm.</br></br>

Caller: Up to, up to now, ‘cause when this pandemic first started, the first 10 months, this prison was without a single case. But, for reasons unknown to me, or to any other inmates, they bust inmates who would resolve cases and put them in POP, in general population, without the benefit of quarantining. They did that with, in every building, at this institution except for building 19. And, currently, building 19 is the only building in this institution that didn’t have a single case of COVID-19.</br></br>

UCI: Mmhmm. And-</br></br>

Caller: So far there have been four deaths.</br></br>

UCI: Oh, go ahead.</br></br>

Caller: Go ahead. Go ahead.</br></br>

UCI: No, I was just gonna say, yeah, I mean, so they started moving people around and, you know, I think you were about to talk about it, but how did that then affect other areas of the facility, other units?</br></br>

Caller: Well, those who did not test positive as of yet, were placed in the gyms with other positive infected inmates or in other buildings with positive infected inmates until everybody who was placed in it, who caught, contracted COVID. And we was housed in a small building, no social distancing, just no more than two-and-a-half feet away from each other but, from each other as we sleep, slept.</br></br> 

UCI: Mmhmm. And, and they did this to, I mean, pretty much everyone, right? I mean you said that not a lot of them were testing positive, but just, really just being moved. So, were they just, I mean, what did staff say to you? Were you guys able to get access to any medical help if you did test positive?</br></br>

Caller: Well, the only thing that happened when we tested positive was they moved us from a quarantine building, from a single cell, to a smaller building where the bunks is just two-and-a-half feet away from each other and just piled, piled us in like we was sardines.</br></br>

UCI: How many individuals do you think were in the quarantine room, would you say?</br></br>

Caller: In the, in the quarantine building or in the small buildings?</br></br>

UCI: The quarantine building, and then you can even say the little smaller buildings, too.</br></br>

Caller: Well, its quarantine building is like 178.</br></br>

UCI: Mmhmm.</br></br>

Caller: Then the small building was 200.</br></br> 

UCI: Two hundred individuals, wow. And did you guys have any, I mean, currently, do you guys even still have access to hand sanitizer or masks or anything like that?</br></br>

Caller: They give us masks. However, the hand sanitizer is alcohol-free.</br></br> 

UCI: Mmhmm.</br></br>

Caller: Because it’s cheaper.</br></br> 

UCI: And have you seen that pretty consistently, even through, like, other areas, like, they’re kind of like, do they not, I mean, if you had individuals at your facility that have tested positive, are they able to get access to Advil or Tylenol or anything like that?</br></br>

Caller: Mostly through the doctors, but you gotta get mostly over-the-counter, they only sell over-the-counter. In canteen, there’s ibuprofen and naproxen. They don’t give out Tylenol in the canteen, so you gotta go see the doctor.</br></br>

UCI: And, is it easy to see a doctor? Or are you having to wait long periods of time to get help?</br></br>

Caller: You have to wait.</br></br> 

Caller: Maybe two, three, maybe a month.</br></br> 

UCI: Wow, to see a doctor. So by the time that most, so by the time that most-</br></br>

Caller: Two, three weeks.</br></br>

UCI: Two, three weeks, yeah. So, by the time most individuals see a doctor, you would say that their symptoms are  -if they did test positive - are pretty much over with?</br></br>

Caller: Yes.</br></br>

UCI: Mmhmm.</br></br> 

Caller: The only way to see a doctor immediately is to do a “man down”, and most times, they don’t even come take you to see a doctor. They tell you to drink some, drink a lot of water and go back to your bunk.</br></br> 

UCI: And go back to your bunk. Can you explain what a “man down” is?</br></br>

Caller: It’s, say you can’t get up and walk, they’ll go put the alarms, say a medical code, and they’ll send a nurse over here. She’ll take your vitals, escort you to the [unintelligible] and take your blood pressure and all that. Then, they’ll decide whether they’re gonna take you to see a doctor or not. Most cases, they don’t take you to see a doctor, but they assign you to see a doctor. But again, it takes, what, two to three weeks, maybe a month, sometimes.</br></br>

UCI: That’s, that’s incredible. Have you noticed any process with getting vaccinated at your facility?</br></br>

Caller: That, like I said, they’re making an effort, however slow. But they are making an effort. I got my first vaccine on, on February 20th.</br></br>

UCI: Wow. That’s, that’s great. And, so, are you able to then get the second dose within the timeframe of about six to eight weeks?</br></br>

Caller: Yes. 28 days, they say.</br></br> 

UCI: Mmhmm.</br></br>

Caller: Some people have gotten the second dose already. They started, with the guidelines, 65 and up, 75 and up, and now, they’re doing everybody else.</br></br> 

UCI: That’s great. That’s wonderful. So, have you seen a lot of staff as well as other individuals, you know, get vaccinated? Or is there some hesitancy with individuals or staff or whoever?</br></br>

Caller: I don’t know about the staff. I mean, some of them have gotten vaccinated. I would guess all of them are because they started with the staff first, so I would guess all of them got it, got vaccinated. They started with the staff. The nurses first, then 75 and up.</br></br>

UCI: Okay, very cool. So, does this then change the way they’re doing things? Does your facility, did it get a little bit more lax as people are getting vaccinated? Or were they never, you know, super careful?</br></br>

Caller: Well, at first, they weren't all that careful, but they was careful enough. Now, they’re, it’s the same. It’s just that we’re not on quarantine protocols anymore because the majority of people in this building are resolved. Yet, they do have people who never tested positive for COVID-19 in, in this building.</br></br>

UCI: So, there’s no, is there still that quarantine, the main building, that you were talking about?</br></br> 

Caller: Nah, they moved me again. They moved me like four times since COVID, since COVID outbreak here, December.</br></br> 

UCI: They just kept shuffling you from, you know, building to building. And were you told why you were being moved?</br></br> 

Caller: They said, the first one is ‘cause somebody in my dorm tested positive, so they moved everybody to quarantine. The same day he tested positive, I tested negative. So, when I get to the, to the quarantine building, that’s where I get, contract COVID-19 ‘cause I’m moving in to a cell that somebody’s just moving out of, and they didn’t clean the cell or spray it down or anything. They just moved me in there and I caught COVID that way.</br></br>

UCI: And how was your experience with COVID?</br></br>

Caller: The headaches were the worst thing. That was it.</br></br> 

UCI: That was it.</br></br>

Caller: Everything else I dealt with. Huh?</br></br>
 
UCI: That was it. So you had a fairly mild case, yeah.</br></br>

Caller: The headaches were so, was bad ‘cause it made my nose bleed. That’s how, that’s how painful, painful it was. My nose was bleeding, started bleeding out of the blue.</br></br>

UCI: Man, and you weren’t able to, did you ever see a doctor, even two, three weeks later after you tested positive? Or just never saw any sort of medical staff?</br></br>

Caller: Well, all they did was take my temperature. Say, “You havin’ COVID-19?” Say, “Yeah,” then they keep on going. Then, when I got found positive, they, they, they tested me positive, they moved me to the building. Then from there, they moved me, from there, they moved me here.</br></br> 

UCI: Man, I mean, I can’t even imagine, you know, not being able to get any sort of help. And I’m happy that you’re, you know, starting your process of being vaccinated.</br></br>

Caller: Yes.</br></br>

UCI: Are you finding that other individuals are also getting vaccinated? Or is there, are they still kind of limited on who can get vaccinated by how many doses are available to everyone?</br></br>

Caller: Well, they’re offering it to everybody but not everybody’s are, not everybody are accepting.</br></br>

UCI: Okay.</br></br> 

Caller: Because they don’t trust the, the vaccine itself.</br></br>

UCI: Right, so there’s no, I guess, there’s no age limit, right, where you have to be this age and up or have underlying health conditions? There’s nothing like that with your vaccination process; it’s just, whoever wants one, one is available.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah. Yeah. Well, they, they come to the buildings and ask anybody. They call people up and say, “Do you want to take the vaccine?” They’ll say “yes” or “no” and, and they did that three times. So, they get their vaccines; they going down the line. They projected that everybody in this institution would get their vaccines by the end of September.</br></br>

UCI: Well, that’s, I mean, you know, hopefully, you know, things start to definitely with feeling comfortable in your facility again for people who are, you know, worried about this pandemic and the virus. Is there any other last comment or, you know, thing you want to say?</br></br>

Caller: Nah, nah, that’s cool, that’s good.</br></br>

UCI: That’s good? Well, thank you so much for calling. We appreciate it.</br></br> 

Caller: All right, thank you. You’re welcome, very welcome. Thank you, bye.</br></br>

UCI: Bye.
