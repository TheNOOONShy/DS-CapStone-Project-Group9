This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Solano.</br></br>Such a herd-immunity is how you control a pandemic best. That is what CDCR is working on by moving us around to make sure we get up to 75% positive, then they will be satisfied. I say this because I have seen and be forced to move into places where they knew had inmates who was tested positive with inmates who was not tested or was tested and was not positive but put us all together.</br></br>I don’t feel at all safe, not the way they are moving me around. I was safe at work, where I was allowed to dress up in what look like a space suit. Or in the PiA laundry, I help wash clothes of inmates who had died from COVID-19 but my 4 bosses would fire anyone who was seen or reported to be without their glasses on mask but if I go sit with an inmate at a 36” x 36” table with my mask off, they would only say keep your mask on if you are in the day room. Plus there is really no place to stand in any building of CSP-Solano were you can be six feet from anyone.</br></br>
