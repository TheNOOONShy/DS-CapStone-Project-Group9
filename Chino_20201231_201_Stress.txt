But this really took a mental toll on me like a roller coaster. I just kept going up and down, to the point where I was really dealing with mental distress something that I've dealt with in the past and was able to overcome easily. But this was on a constant level. It just kept coming. I felt anxious, nervous, and would even lose sleep.</br></br>

Now I admit that I never really admitted to having these type of issues or ever speaking about it openly amongst my peers so I just had to remain strong and roll with the punches. I had no choice but to just choose to remain as optimistic as I could. I want to say that this lasted for a couple months of just constant mental warfare because others were also going through it which seemed to make things worse.
