This story was told by a person incarcerated at Avenal.</br></br>

UCI: And what is the current COVID-19 situation at your facility? Like what's going okay, is there anything troubling or concerning to you?</br></br>

Caller: Oh, it’s been, it’s been very troubling and concerning from the start to the end because before we had a major break out. I guess they, due to overcrowding, we’re, we're not given social distance.</br></br>

I live in the dorms and it’s, there’s a 130 men in like a, maybe, 100-by-30 foot dorm with eight toilets, 16 sinks, eight shower heads. When we complain about it. They're really just not doing nothing about it.</br></br> 

UCI: I see.</br></br>

Caller: I could go on and on and on. But I filed myself on like, I guess what your call a jailhouse lawyer.</br></br>
 
And I filed a lot of paperwork on it and it's - the responses are few and far in between but it's just like, I would, I would love to present my, my, I can write much better than I can speak because it's so intense and the situation is so dire. And I lost two friends. I know two friends.</br></br>

So, I had one a celly, that was down at Chino. He died up at San Quentin State Prison. And then there was a guy on this yard who died who didn't have to die and it's - it's sad, it’s very sad that-</br></br>

UCI: Oh sir, we do have, we do accept letters. So if you'd also like to tell your story like that, you can call and write.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, I would love for you guys to look at - yeah, I would love for you guys to look at the letter and my complaints because it details everything in thorough, and you can see their responses. It's crazy, but I got to get a pen. Okay. What’s the address?</br></br>

UCI: So it’s P.O. Box 4430, Sunland, CA. Yeah, 4430. </br></br>

Caller: Sunland, CA?</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, and then Sunland’s connected. And then 91041. </br></br>

Caller: Now, I’ve, I've reported all this stuff to like the San Quentin Prison Law Office, to the prisoners’ rights and they’ve been really, they’ve tooken all of my calls and stuff like that. But, I just, from the start of the pandemic to now, I haven’t seen nothing change.</br></br>

And we're, you know, of course, we're now, we're going into this, these new strains. And you know, like today on the, on the radio, I heard that inmates were getting vaccinated before COs. Well, that's a lie. And that's a complete lie, because they did vaccinate the never-nevers.</br></br> 

But no one else has been offered it and I would say less than 38 percent, or even lower of the COs actually took the vaccine, and a lot of them got sick when they took it. Likewise with the inmates.</br></br>

UCI: So are the vaccinations being offered to inmates?</br></br>

Caller: Just to the never-nevers, the people that allegedly never had it, but-</br></br> 

UCI: Oh.</br></br>

Caller: But they were like, just people that were just scared because when you reported it, they'll like, they moved us all to one building and put all the sick people together, right on top of each other. And it's like, when you put sick people with sick people, you get sicker people, because I caught it twice.</br></br>

I had it once in January. And then I caught it, I've tested positive again in July 28. And then they threw us in a building and they were doing moves at like 11 or 12 o'clock at night, and they put us all in the building and then I got really, really sick. But the problem is, like, a lot of us, like I'm a lifer. We’ve been down for a long time.</br></br> 

They just, our property and stuff, they, if you get sick and they take you out, they just leave your property sitting there, you know, unattended, you know, people could steal it or whatever. It's like, I just said to myself, if I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die. I'm not gonna, I have too much legal property. I've been fighting for my life for the last, you know, 21 years I’ve been in prison.</br></br>

And I wasn't going to take the chance to leave my property just sitting there for unattended, for anybody just to pilfer or steal or whatever.</br></br>

UCI: Can you talk about your experience with getting COVID while in prison, like were you guys given proper medicine, or?</br></br>

Caller: Nothing, yes, nothing, they didn't, they even like, they would come do our temperature checks and our oxygen checks. You'd tell them "Hey I got a sore throat I feel really, really bad. I don't feel good," or this or that. And they, I, I - I'm going through the process. I got all my medical records.</br></br>

And if you look at, they have them all, whenever I reported from, or, in my case, whenever I reported symptoms to the nurses like I got a really bad sore throat, I could hardly breathe. I'm running a really, really bad temperature. If you look on the vital statistics, they didn’t mark none of that down. It's like, if you look like, oh, I just had no problem whatsoever when in reality, I was suffering bad.</br></br>

And I was asking for help. But I got none, they didn't. They hired these nurses to come in and do our vitals. But they were just there to do our vitals. Now if somebody was really, really sick, really, really sick, they would take them out to like CPC or out the hospital. But you had to be like, basically you have to fall out, you know what I mean?</br></br>

And in, you know, my situation, it wasn’t an option because I have three, four boxes of legal work that I had to protect. So, I just, you know, the three, four nights when they moved me over to the 20, I just, I was ready. I just, I just said if I'm going to die, I’m going to die.</br></br> 

You know, and luckily, I survived but I really feel like the two times in 21 years that I got sick, that was like the closest, I feel I’ve ever been to dying, you know what I mean? It was, it's horrific. No, no medicine. Once in a while, they turned out a bottle of Motrin. Which I think we learned that they, the doctors on the streets are telling us not to take.</br></br> 

UCI: And then, oh, sorry.</br></br>

Caller: But, you know, overall and it's like, before the pandemic started, we told them about masks, you know, what if this happened, and, you know, we're so close, we're two feet away from our bunkie next to us and we're like saying, “Hey, you know, we, you know, people would come in and have symptoms, and you're telling me you can't put people on these bunks.”</br></br> 

They came in at first and tried to like, one bunk, separate, a bunk, but you got a bunkie. Everybody’s still got a bunkie. So, you got a guy living on top of you who may not practice social distancing, may not practice proper hygiene.</br></br>

And he's associating with people that are, how do you put it, like, in the I would say, like the lifestyle of, let's say, not, I don't know how to put that. But there's people maybe, that maybe, smoke cigarettes, or do drugs, or stuff like that, you know, they're sharing stuff, and then we're forced to be like, right there with them, you know what I mean.</br></br> 

We can't tell them, "Hey, you can do that, you can’t practice that, because you're gonna get me sick, and I could die from this" or, you know, "I don't want to, I don't want to get sick," or, you know, they run us into the chow hall, they create these six-feet, like social distancing things but they run us into the chow hall and sit us four at a table.</br></br> 

Just packed in and it’s just the whole policies and procedures, and the way that they handled the pandemic and God forbid, if it, you know, if it does come worse, or another worse pandemic comes. They’re so ill prepared to deal with the situation because of the overcrowding in prisons, you know.</br></br> 

They did some transfers in the middle of the whole pandemic and like it’s weird because they talked about all of these other prisons, like San Quentin and Chino having the highest COVID rate. But if you look at the statistics, Avenal was the worst of all of the prisons as far as infection rate and, and stuff like that, and they haven't done, nothing's changed.</br></br>

They don't provide the proper cleaning. They don't provide the proper social distancing space, they don’t. But they're petty on all the other stuff like, like, "Oh, wear your mask." They gave us N-95 masks probably like seven or eight months after the policy. And they, they threaten us to wear the masks, the CDCR custody staff. A lot of times they ain’t wearing their masks, you know, and it's like, it's just, do as I say not as I do. And I mean, I could go on, I listed it all as far as-</br></br> 

UCI: I see.</br></br>

Caller: I kept pretty good notes.</br></br> 

UCI: Yeah, thank you for that. And, personally, how have you been coping with the crisis? Oh, and also, I think the call expires in two minutes. So also, like any final thoughts before we get cut off?</br></br>

Caller: Personally, like, you know, visiting wise and, and overall morale, we get a yard still to this date, we only get a yard, sometimes an hour a day, you know, from having yard four times a day. It's been, it's been really stressful. I mean, our overall programming and just the way that we get treated is just, I wish they would let cameras in and people could really see what’s going on, because what’s portrayed by the media, and, and politicians, it's not what, what reality is as far as what's really going on here in prison.</br></br>

And you know, in some cases, it's bad, but and not all cases. And we're not all monsters and, you know, deserve to be locked up and murderers and, and all these people that deserve no rights or we're spoiled. Because if you've seen the conditions, the squalor that we live in, and we experience from day to day, you'd be like, it would just, I think it would, it should shock the conscience because so many people are coming out.</br></br>

But in a final thought I would just say that. I wish that there was more oversight. I wish there was more, somebody that would take accountability because the people and the things that have happened, they haven't took into account. They haven't changed any policies or procedures. They're still intermixing negatives with positives, possible positives.</br></br>

They're still transferring people that are, have come up positive and leave them in the situation and transfer them and it's just a mess. It's, it's, it's a mess inside these prisons, especially here and God forbid if we hit a worse pandemic, we are, there’s going to be a lot more people that die in there. And if you look at the ratio, why did so many inmates have to die?</br></br>

But so few officers and staff died because they got to go home, isolate, take medicine, and take care of themselves. If we get sick, we get nothing. Absolutely nothing. We just sit in here and suffer, until you’re either gonna die and then they'll do something for you.</br></br>

UCI: Well, thank you for that. And thank you very much for participating in PrisonPandemic. Please consider telling your friends about us and seeing if they would like to call.
