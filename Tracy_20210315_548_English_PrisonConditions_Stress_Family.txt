Hi PrisonPandemic,</br></br>

Well, hope en God you are all in good health. My life in prison is not easy, it’s horrible to live here and I don't wish that upon anyone to live here. Before the pandemic, there were programs to help you become responsible in one's actions, like to change the negative thinking to positive, with people like you and those who live on the streets, have a strong mind. That motivates you to be different and come out rehabilitated, and to make change in oneself for when you come out.</br></br>

Now with the COVID19 pandemic, how life can change from one moment to another when people from outside do not come to help us, to motivate us because in reality, nobody writes to me and visits me. They are all in Mexico, my family, I see them as family, they motivate me and I give it my best. At first, they did not take the virus so seriously, but from one moment to another it changed. The ones with the virus were put in another dormitory.</br></br>

There are no programs, we don't have yard too often. Everything changed, don’t believe if they were afraid of a new virus, how it would hit us without adequate attention. I saw on television how people were catching the virus, and those who were outside died quickly. Now, I who am locked up and my family in Mexico pray and pray and I asked God how a miracle came, a ray of light, a brochure saying that if the vaccine will arrive, you will put it on. And at the moment, I did feel suspicious of the new vaccine, but then I thought God loves us.</br></br>

I already received both vaccines but I continue to take care of myself. I did have side effects with the first vaccine. My body ached, had fever, it was bad for me but I took ibuprofen, with that they fix everything here. With the second dose, I had no symptoms, but I have doubts that the virus can even hit us vaccinated and a new virus, may God take care of us and protect us.</br></br>

How this virus changed our lives. A job crisis came, the economy like people cannot yet recover from the crisis. I feel sad for those who also died, thousands of people, and I lost my father in Mexico, and I can't do anything, a brother, life must go on. I feel horrible, sad about the loss of them.</br></br>

But speaking of the prison, they are closing it and moving us to another. I am scared to go to another prison where there is more of the spread of virus because we eat in the same plate. They just wash them and we can catch them through the blankets. They just wash it, but the moving can spread the virus, I have had stress because of that, but for something, things happen.</br></br>

Thank you for your worries for the prisoners. God bless all.
