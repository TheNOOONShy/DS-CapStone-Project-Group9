PrisonPandemic,</br></br>

A friend of mine gave me your hook-up and I’m wondering if you were still accepting COVID stories? If so do let me know and I’ll send you something you may be interested in. Thank you for your time.</br></br>

Do excuse my writing. I had a stroke on January 20th, 2020 and I’m just getting around to somewhat fitting on both cylinders. That’s about where my COVID story begins – either way, thank you.</br></br>

I thought you’d find this sketch interesting. A show up in San Francisco in 2016? I tried to sketch it today, still recovering. Anyways, blah blah blah.</br></br>

Sincerely.
