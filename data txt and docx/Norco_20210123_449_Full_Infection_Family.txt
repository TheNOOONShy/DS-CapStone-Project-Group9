Dear PrisonPandemic Project,</br></br> 

Hello. I have received your letter. I would like to thank you for the letter. I will be honest, I have been working on a book about my time in prison. Specifically focusing on this pandemic and how hard it has been.</br></br>

I got sick with COVID and was only told to drink a lot of water. I got my finger amputated at work during COVID. And have not been able to see my mother in six years. For some reason they keep denying her, but she is approved to see my brother at a different institution.</br></br>

It has been hard, but I must stay strong. So, I always stay positive so that they allow me to leave early to my family. My book would contain over 1,000 pages. I would love to share it with you once I get out.</br></br>

Now, I cannot share much, only what I feel comfortable with. I do not know your project. I do wish for you to stay in contact with me so that a trusting relationship can be built.</br></br>

Can I send this as legal mail? Well thank you for everything positive your project is doing for us prisoners. God bless you for that! Keep in mind these last six years plus have not been good.</br></br>

When I get out, I will use this experience to help young kids from coming here. My experience can help many kids and people not end up in prison. God bless you.</br></br>
 
Sincerely.
