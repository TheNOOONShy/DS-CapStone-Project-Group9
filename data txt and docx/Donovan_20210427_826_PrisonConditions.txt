This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Donovan.</br></br>Since the awareness of the COVID-19 outbreak in our prison facility, the CDCR DAI had directed all prison institutions to implement a 14 day modified program on June 19, 2020, that was effective June 22, at 1600 hours. The “plan of operation notice,” that was distributed to all (3) E-yard buildings stating in part; Dayroom and yard schedule will be minimized in order to afford sufficient space for appropriate social distancing. Also, all movement will be controlled and limited to afford appropriate social distancing until further notice from the (DAI) Department of Adult Institution.</br></br>As for the beginning question, “What has been happening inside facilities during the COVID-19 pandemic?” My story begins with my emotional seesaw experience of whether I am going to die or not, and disbelief of CDCR disregard for inmates human life. Although, CDCR/RJD state prison has slowly taken necessary precaution to deal with this pandemic situation, I elect to mention that CDCR/RJD had resulted to negligence in wrongfully spreading the virus and causing inmates death throughout various CDCR institutions in California.</br></br>My claim stems from observation and provided knowledge from “internal sources,” that infected employees were still allowed to remain at work at first, and the transferring of infected inmates from one location to another location within the present facility and aboard was wrongfully in motion. The more infected population, the more “Coronavirus Aid Relief” that CDCR can request from the government to continue to stuff their pockets more.</br></br>
