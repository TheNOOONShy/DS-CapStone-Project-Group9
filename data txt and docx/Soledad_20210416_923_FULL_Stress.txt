Dear PrisonPandemic,</br></br>

Hello my dear friends. I’m from Mexico City, and I’m 41 years old. I've been in prison for 20 years. Thank God I have a strong mind. I’m a very positive person. I have been through a lot crazy stuff here in prison.</br></br>

I’m glad we are almost over with this. Our situation has brought a lot of confusion here in prison, but I’m OK I’m always thinking positive. I’m the kind of person that think that when we got to go, we got to go.</br></br>

I’m not afraid of dying. Eventually everybody will die. I’m just thankful for another day of life. I’m doing 41 years to life, but I still got the hope of one day getting my freedom.</br></br>

Thank you very much for your letter. I'm so happy to hear from you students. Live life to the max, don’t let nothing steal the peace on your heart, and always enjoy the moment. Take care out there and always be happy.</br></br>

Thanks a lot for your beautiful thoughts.
