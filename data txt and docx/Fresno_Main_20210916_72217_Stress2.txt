Caller: I appreciate taking the time to write a beautiful note. It's very encouraging. And so, do you have any questions that you might want to know or any interests that your fellow classmates might have, you know? Questions you might be pondering and would like to know about our environment, our conditions, our mental health?</br></br>

I mean, 'cause we're in a psych tank too. This is where they take - bring the people with medications who take psych medications. Not all of us are here because there's actually thousands that actually take medications, but there's 45 of us that are in this tank. So, it's bedlam.</br></br> 

You know, it's always like this psychiatric uproar, you know? Something's always happening. And - but, you know, nothing that we can't overcome. Just - just people emotionally overwhelmed, and they express it differently.</br></br>

So, yeah. So, we're locked down. We haven't stepped out of this cell since, what is it? Almost a month we've just been in here. Just caged in. And we're strong men, though, you know?</br></br> 

Not everybody can do that, you know? Stay in a Starbucks for a month, you know? It's just like, you know? Are you okay?
