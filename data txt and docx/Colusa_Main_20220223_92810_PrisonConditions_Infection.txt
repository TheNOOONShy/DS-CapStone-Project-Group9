This story was told by a person incarcerated at Colusa County Jail.</br></br>

Caller: The COVID situation has not been taken really serious. They most definitely don’t provide us masks upon movement. They do upon court dates, but like regularly they don’t switch them out. They just let us keep – they expect us to keep the same one.</br></br>

As for family and stuff, coming to visit and visitation and things like that, everything’s pretty normal. They just  – they have behind-the-glass visits and stuff like that. They have us on the 23-hour lockdown.</br></br>

For some inmates they consider it classifying us as high max. They put us in lockdown for 23 hours a day or 21 hours a day, so they give us two hours of break. And as far as like, what else? Like, as far as all COVID related?</br></br>

UCI: Yeah. Anything that you feel you need to talk about COVID-wise.</br></br>

Caller: Well the main thing – that’s the main thing, the mask situation. And when I was housed in general population, they have tanks filled up to the max capacity. There’s no room for social distancing.</br></br> 

We don’t have, like, cleaning supplies or, like, antibacterial, disinfectant given to us daily. They packed it once a day, but I feel like they should have like a spray bottle or something.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>

Caller: I was just – I was just recently in prison in Solano. And they used to provide us with, like, spray bottles for our sections. Spray bottles with bleach, constantly wash our hands, and hand towels, so we could continue to wipe down frequently used areas. As far as masks, they’d give us the surgical masks.</br></br>

Like I said, they only provided one surgical mask instead of, like, providing us numerous ones, and putting a box of masks in our dorm facility. They’d give us one every time we go to court, they expect us to reuse that one. I actually got a habeas corpus going on that I just recently filed. I’m waiting from the Supreme Court to get back on me about that.</br></br>
 
Because I feel like there’s more that they could be doing instead of just the limit that they give us. What else, what else? Yeah, as far as like cleaning supplies I feel like they could be doing more than once a day. I feel like they could be letting us our cells a little bit more.</br></br>

Like I said, the capacity to the housing units are 10 – 10 people per dorm. They – when I was out there in general population they already had filled us up to the max. And due to the fact that there was like a little cough of flu going around, I – I wrote a grievance.
