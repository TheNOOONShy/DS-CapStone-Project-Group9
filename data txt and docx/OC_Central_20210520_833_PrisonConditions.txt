This story was told by a person incarcerated at OC Central Justice Central. </br></br>


Caller: I've only been here for about a month but I was in the Theo Lacy facility for a good two and a half years. Long time. I've been here for about a month. Over here, you know, it was just yesterday it was just yesterday was the first day we had coronavirus killing solution. </br></br>


We've had sanitizer that does it too but that's as far as it goes. No liquid solution that actually goes and kills a virus we just got that recently that is only able to be used for showers. And at the area where I'm at for tables and chairs inside of a day room area. </br></br>


But we've had other solution which was cleaning solution and it was never noted that it was for uh to kill the coronavirus. You know, again, I've only been in this facility or, not facility, the jail jail, for about a month now at the Theo Lacy facility, we didn't, I mean, it was it was way rougher over there. Way rougher. </br></br>


I mean, you know, you would think a year after the pandemic. A year, March, April, about 13 months after the pandemic now you're being given the coronavirus killing solution that it was you know, I just noted that over here and that was yesterday and I've been here for a month, but over there I don't know how it's working out but there were times in the beginning that the solution, the cleaning solution, would run out but you know, that was it so. </br></br>


You have to make the best out of it but after a few months of everything I was- they were, you know, replacing it a little more but it was solution to just to clean up and everything but you know, surprisingly I don't know how the mattresses, the area, the wall, you know just anything in contact with anyone that was in contact with or not in contact with- I don't understand how like that was for sure like not thoroughly cleaned or sanitized with coronavirus killing solutions. That was over there. </br></br>


Over here it just seems like I just came to like a new area and you know, things were dusty and didn't seem like it was cleaned prior to people arriving. So that’s just uh- not only that, when you're when you're in quarantine, quarantine is very rough. You're only given 30 minute day rooms and in the day rooms are able to shower, you're able to come out of your cell. </br></br>


They’re in two man cells, you know, you never know if you're with one person or- in which if you were with another person and people were complaining about hygiene [unintelligible]. This is you know, when they’re first coming in, that the pin number is working so they can call loved ones and stuff to make a phone call like this. They're only allowed to be outside for a little bit, you know, like 20, 30 minutes. </br></br>


Yeah, that was that was the other facility that was at the Theo Lacy facility and I think the majority of the people were taken there when they first got into jail- facility, so. It was yeah, it was it was pretty rough. I mean, you got to get the sanitizer which is the only coronavirus killing solution which is only for your hands. That took a good couple months just to receive that. Like I said for a couple months just to have some solution. </br></br>


But, you know, that's as far as, as far as you could say a few months ago. But even you know, the worst part about it, you know, not only was just the virus issue, but your courts weren't taken seriously. Pushed off, pushed off, like who cares? Let's not even ask him to show up. You know, like you, you're- what's the reason to be in jail if you're not going to court? Having to wait a whole year just to have a hearing, because of the pandemic when the court has a lot of free time. It's just unheard of. </br></br>


Things, you know, things like that, you know, when it came to cleaning, came to court being pushed off, you're just you're just sitting here. When there's a lot of free time, when there's a lot of financial resources to assist. But you're just like oh well. Yeah. You know, on Fridays, yeah, there was there was a commissary given, a couple. Hold on. I have to- give me, give me, give me a second hold on.
