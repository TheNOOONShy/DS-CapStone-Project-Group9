This story was told by a person incarcerated at Solano.</br></br>Caller: Okay, I am currently at CSP Solano.</br></br>UCI: Okay.</br></br>Caller: And, we’ve had a COVID-19 outbreak here. I mean this is what they’re telling us. But some of the issues that we’re dealing with here, I have like, let me see, I have like 13 points to my agenda here. That are some of the things that I could like to go over with you.</br></br>
UCI: Okay sure.</br></br>
Caller: One- the first is the probably the most important, is they have exposed us to the COVID-19 virus, and through their ineffective and irresponsible collection and testing protocols here. What they’ve been doing is they’ve been bringing medical staff into our dorms, and they’re bringing medical staff, and the medical staff are not changing their PPE out.</br></br>

They’re testing guys through the nasal swab, and they’re taking, putting the collection into a glass tube, and then they’re moving on to the next inmate. They’re not changing their- they didn’t change their gloves, they didn’t change their PPE, they didn’t change anything.</br></br>So, prior to that, none of us were sick. We were all healthy, and for me and myself, I was in building 16, in dorm 16, and none of us were sick in there. And then they came and tested us, and they used that procedure. And then they came a second time to test us and used the same procedure, and then we all started coming down with the COVID virus at that point.</br></br>After that, they said that we were- they condemned our dorm, and they started mixing the population and circulating the prison population by moving us from dorm 16 to building seven, which is on a whole ‘nother facility. To the B- to the facility B gym, and now currently we’re in the facility C gym. And they’re doing this with hundreds of men. So, it’s like something that the virus is thriving in, is this circulation, this, it’s like they’re transferring us inter-institution, but the virus is thriving in that condition.</br></br>UCI: Right.</br></br>Caller: So, a lot us, yeah. So a lot of us got really sick, and we have all types of symptoms. Body aches, congestion, high fever, loss of smell, loss of taste, the chills, bone aches, lethargy.</br></br>UCI: Mhmm.</br></br>Caller: A number of things. Then the number two was the exposure and contact from medical staff, they’re not changing their PPE during COVID-19 collection. Okay we’ve been tested on the date that I can't remember and I have recorded. We were tested on November 19th, which were negative.</br></br>

We were tested on November 24th, which was negative. We're tested on November 27th. We were tested on December 1st, December 3rd, and then December 7th, the test subsequently came up positive. Okay. [Unintelligible] that was- test came up positive.</br></br>But interesting enough, is the first positive test we- that they said we came back positive for, they subsequently moved us into an ICU area among other inmates who were already exposed or tested positive. Without giving us the benefit of a second test to determine what that first initial test was a false positive. So, we didn’t know if we were exposed or not, or if it’s the first test that says it was positive was a false positive.</br></br>

So, they put us, put our lives in peril in the sense that they said, on paper, without giving us a confirmation, that we were testing positive but they didn’t give us a follow up test before putting us in isolation around inmates who they knew for sure had the COVID-19. So, we were forced to go into that situation without any recourse.</br></br>
For instance, they’re housing us in gyms, which have by court order, federal court order, these gyms have been closed and condemned to live in. To inmates living in the gym, but yet they have us, they have us living in these gyms. This particular gym, facility B, between facility D and C were exposed to the outside elements, because the wind and the rain are blowing in the gym.</br></br>

There are extreme temperatures. The roof is actually leaking water.</br></br>
UCI: Wow.</br></br>Caller: Excuse me?</br></br>UCI: I’m sorry, I just said wow that’s crazy.</br></br>Caller: Yeah. Well, the roof is leaking water into the gym, there is currently, right now I’m looking at it. There’s puddles on the floor, they have, they’re using trash cans to collect the water, and the water is literally coming through the roof in sheets. It’s absolutely crazy. And, and the thing is, the gym, they have I think they have what they call a swamp cooler on the roof.</br></br>

There is no heat. The conditions of the ambient temperatures up here in the Solano area are like 40, 50 degrees in the, you know, early morning.</br></br>UCI: Mhmm.</br></br>Caller: There hasn’t been any heat or, it’s like freezing. I’m sleeping literally with a beanie, a jacket, and two blankets. And the cops are coming around, the officers are coming around harassing us about putting tents up.</br></br>

Just about trying to stay warm. You know.</br></br>
UCI: Mhmm.</br></br>Caller: And I’m, you know, all of us in the gym, have, per se, tested positive for COVID. So, if we’re tested positive for COVID then that means that we are all patients. In a hospital situation. There, this cold air blowing in is not giving us the benefit to recovery.</br></br>

You know.</br></br>
UCI: Right.</br></br>Caller: To beat COVID you have to deal with pneumonia.</br></br>
UCI: Right.</br></br>Caller: The flu, after COVID, and it’s just ridiculous. Well, let’s see, there’s no, the HVAC units in the gyms are inoperative. So, we’re not getting any heat. And it’s blowing cold air from the outside, from the ambient temperature outside.</br></br>

Let’s see, there’s a sergeant in that came and talked to us about some of the things that were going on and I wrote a list out for her. But there is no hazmat material cleanup crew to clean the isolation cells, and the areas designated for inmates who are sick. So, that means, that when they told us that they were going to move us, there was a fit.</br></br>
They told us, the 60 of us, to roll all of our property up, we were going over to building 7, which is in facility B, which are cells. So we’re going from the dorms to the cells. When we got to those cells, those cells were filthy. You could just, apparent, obvious, no one had cleaned those cells, no one had sanitized the cells, nothing.</br></br>

So, a lot of guys ended up catching, some kind of, I don’t know, some, a lung infection, some kind of allergic reaction to the poor ventilation that we were getting. That’s another issue I want to talk to you about, about the ventilation of the prison. So, they’re exposing us to unsanitary conditions.</br></br>UCI: Mhmm.</br></br>Caller: And that they’re not cleaning the cells. They’re rotating inmates, rotating a circulation of the population around and they’re not sanitizing this place. So, the guys that had been in that cell before me, if he had COVID, then the COVID is in the walls, it’s on the table, it’s on the desk, and we’re exposed to it.</br></br>UCI: Right.</br></br>Caller: Because they didn’t sanitize it correctly. Okay that’s number four. Number five is in the dorm, in the gym, right now there are mice, vermin, and insects in the gym. They’re running- they’ve reactivated the gyms, so this is in violation of a court order.</br></br>

So, we have, we’re finding mice droppings. And what I was going to do, I was going to collect some of the samples, and hold on to them. I was going to give them to the sergeant and show her. Because-</br></br>UCI: Mhmm.</br></br>Caller: She was like, very reluctant to believe that we have mice in here. And then there are vermin, there are big super-sized cockroaches that are running around. I don’t know-</br></br>UCI: Oh.</br></br>Caller: -what species they are, but they’re huge, huge cockroaches. And there’s mice running around literally eating people’s food that’s on the floor. They’re making us store all of our stuff on the floor. They they have a small container we can dump stuff in, but most guys have accumulated, you know, a lot of personal stuff.</br></br>

And, you know, our food and the canteen items that we get are, kind of, exposed to the mice, to rats, to whatever vermin that gets under the door because there’s no insulation under the door. There’s like an inch gap under the door that leads from outside into the gym, and the field mice come in and have their way with it.</br></br>Okay, that’s number five. Mice and vermin. Number six, I think I said this, but I’m gonna rehash it. The first positive test of corona-19 was unconfirmed.</br></br>

That unconfirmed test was getting prisoners and inmates in quarantine, in isolation without the benefit of a second test, to confirm, yay or nay, that it was a positive or false positive. So, we’re sitting in isolation with guys who actually have been confirmed to test positive. Based on the first test and were then confirmed with a second test.</br></br>

So, I don’t think that’s right. I don’t think that was fair, that we didn’t have, we have no recourse.</br></br>UCI: Right.</br></br>Caller: Nothing we can do about it. Then, okay number seven was the issue, because I want a liability, I wanted to create a liability and a paper trail. Number seven is they’re not giving us a confirmed– can I call you back?</br></br>UCI: Yeah, yeah yeah yeah, if we run out of time you can call me again.</br></br>Caller: Okay, number seven, we’re running- they’re not giving us confirming documentation of the COVID positive test results.</br></br>UCI: Mhmm.</br></br>Caller: So, they’re just telling us that we’re positive and then they’re sending us into the, into this, environment that really potentially puts us at risk. Without giving us confirmation, confirming documentation to prove that we actually have the virus. Or, and then, the doctor that they are giving us we're noticing that the male nurse, on the form it’s not listing the date that the positive test was rendered.</br></br>

So, there’s no date on it. It just says that you’re- you have received a positive COVID-19 test, and it doesn’t give the date when the test was taken, who took it. It’s not giving any detailed information.</br></br>
UCI: You can go ahead and continue.</br></br>Caller: Okay I was at number seven.</br></br>UCI: Mhmm.</br></br>Caller: They’re saying there’s confirming documentation of the COVID-19 positive test results. So, we don’t know which test- like I said they’ve given us seven or eight tests up to this point. So, we don’t know which test popped positive, which is negative. Or even if we did pop positive.</br></br>

Because a lot of us are conspiracy theorists and, you know, there’s a lot of conspiracy theories, a lot of doubt, paranoia. And a lot of us feel like what we’re suffering through is flu symptoms. And they’re outlining them as COVID-19 to get revenue from the federal government, or to enlist more medical staff. I don’t- we don’t know what they’re doing.</br></br>UCI: Mhmm.</br></br>Caller: But a lot of us are not like suffering severe- we’re getting some non-life-threatening, moderate symptoms from this virus. Whatever it is, we’re suffering up here. There’s a handful of guys that have been hospitalized but by in large, you- we have moderate to non-severe symptoms up here. Right.</br></br>

Now that’s to not to say that it couldn’t get worse.</br></br>UCI: Mhmm.</br></br> Caller: Let's see. We have number- I have number eight. Now while we’re being circulated like this, we don’t have the benefit of the laundry facilities because the prison laundry is shut down. They shut the prison down. So, we have no means to clean our clothes. So, we have guys who are sick, in a hospital ward, who don’t have the benefit to maintain cleanliness. You know, with regards to, laundry and maintaining their hygiene.</br></br>UCI: Mhmm.</br></br>Caller: Let’s see number nine. After, what they’re telling me, and I’m not in that situation yet because this is like my ninth day. But after 14 days in this isolation ward that they have us in, once you clear, they say after 14 days you clear the COVID-19 virus. What they’re doing is they’re sending inmates back out into the general population.</br></br>

But what is striking is they’re separating us from our property. So, they’re saying, “We’re gonna send you back into the general population but we’re gonna keep your property to decontaminate your property.” Now I can understand that to some degree, but what they’re doing is they’re not securing the property.</br></br>

You have inmate's property just sitting out under the podium. Sitting out unsecured, so someone can just steal and take your property. And I don’t think that’s right.</br></br>Also, I’m not sure, scientifically, if you release me back into the general population, that I wouldn’t be more susceptible to contaminate other inmates than my property. I don’t know how much germ or how long the virus lives on property, as opposed to a biological organism by itself.</br></br>UCI: Mhmm.</br></br>Caller: But this is what they’re telling us, and we don’t have the science to argue with them. They have the absolute authority over us. But anyway, the property is unsecured and is accessible by strange inmates. Some of us are, you know, we have our family’s addresses, personal information, case information in our property, and other inmates can just grab it and take it.</br></br>

And I don’t think that’s right. Number 10. We’re not getting adequate yard or fresh air. Now some of the scientists on television are saying that fresh air and being outside social distancing is a good thing.</br></br>UCI: Mhmm.</br></br>Caller: We’re locked in this dorm. We’re locked in this gymnasium all day, every day, days at a time. And we’re just not getting fresh air and exercise on a regular basis. We’ve been out one time, but just not on a regular basis.</br></br>Number 11. We’re have no emergency medications. Like i.e., Tylenol, cough drops, vapor rub, analgesic bombs. Nothing, they’re giving us absolutely nothing.</br></br>

Then they’re saying "Well there’s no cure for the virus", but they’re not helping with the moderate and the mild symptoms that men are suffering through. You know. They should be passing out cough drops and Tylenol and acetaminophen or whatever it is to help relieve some of the symptoms that guys are having, and they’re not doing it.</br></br>

And I don’t think that’s right.</br></br>UCI: So-</br></br>Caller: Also- yeah.</br></br>UCI: So basically, it’s like if you test positive and then you get like moved out, and you have symptoms, they aren’t helping those symptoms in any way?</br></br>Caller: In any way, no. They’re not doing anything. They’re locking you in a cell. And then from the cells then there’s, after a few days, then they send you over to the gym if you’re a level two like most of us are.</br></br>UCI: Mhmm.</br></br>Caller: And they’re just, they come through twice a day, and they do vital signs. They come in and take our vitals and do a pulse oximeter, and they do blood pressure and take your temperature and that’s it. And they’re not giving us anything.</br></br>UCI: Wow.</br></br>Caller: Absolutely nothing. And people are suffering. They’re sneezing, they’re coughing.</br></br>UCI: Mhmm.</br></br>Caller: They got a sore throat. It’s just a number of range of things-</br></br>UCI: Right.</br></br>Caller: -that they could be doing, and they’re not doing it. They’re just not doing it.</br></br>UCI: Mhmm.</br></br>Caller: That’s number 11. Number 12, we have limited access to our families. They’re profiting from these calls right now.</br></br>UCI: Mhmm.</br></br>Caller: I had to call you collect. You know. This is a world pandemic, and they’re profiting. We can’t call our families to check to see, I have a 75-year-old mother. I can’t call her because she’s definitely afraid of to put her credit card with the GTL.</br></br>

And, you know, you have a lot of men that are like that here. Their family members are old, and you know, they’re living on a fixed income. So they’re profiting off of the fact that we’re incarcerated, going through this. And this is a pandemic.</br></br>UCI: Mhmm.</br></br>Caller: And they’re just not, they’re not being sensitive or compassionate to what we’re going through. Also, the final issue here, well actually there’s just one more. This number 13 is a ventilation of filtration systems are filthy. There’s, when I'm looking at right now at the, the ventilation system and there’s no drop sealing.</br></br>

So we’re exposed to the roof, so I’m looking at an inch of dust. Literally an inch of dust inside the ventilation system, on top of the ventilation system, and on the air ducts. And then on the beams, there’s monocoat on the beams and the monocoat is just filthy with dust built up on it. And some of it, like I said is, you know, it's leaking here in the gym.</br></br>UCI: Mhmm.</br></br>Caller: It’s been removed, and the beams are showing, and they’re rusted. And there’s rust roll- there's rust, dripping down the wall and it’s just terrible. It just looks filthy. But the issue is they’re not changing the filters-</br></br>UCI: Mhmm.</br></br>Caller: -in the actual ventilation system. So we’re breathing particulates, we’re breathing dust. It’s causing lung infections, and it’s just terrible. It’s horrible.</br></br>

Also, when we were in the dorms originally, they were separating the bunk beds, so they were actually practicing social distancing. </br></br>UCI: Mhmm.</br></br>Caller: But now that we’re in this gymnasium hospital ward, this ward that really actually been condemned by the court, now there’s no social distancing. They have men packed in here like sardines now. We’re side by side. There’s over 100 and some odd men in here, and they’re bringing them in.</br></br>

They bring one out, they take one out, they bring two in. So it’s just overcrowded, and the conditions are just, it’s just horrible in here. It's just crazy. So we’re stacked in here like sardines and dominos, and they don’t care. You know.</br></br>

They’re just- Yes, hello? </br></br>UCI: Hello?</br></br>Caller: Yes.</br></br>UCI: Yeah, oh my god, I’m so sorry, I have no idea what, what happened, I’m sorry.</br></br>Caller: I know what happened, the medical staff came in and the telephone I was on was on the side they do their triage on, so the officer didn’t even give me the benefit of saying “Hey there’s medical staff” so they shut the phone off, so they cut us off.</br></br>UCI: Oh my god, okay, I thought-</br></br>Caller: That’s how cruel they are.</br></br>

UCI: Ugh, yeah, that's awful.</br></br>

Caller: I was about to finish up. I’m not sure, I think I was on 13, I was talking about ventilation filtration systems and how filthy the dust particulates are- </br></br>UCI: Yeah, you were telling me about after that we- I think we got through that and you were telling me about how it’s very crowded.</br></br>Caller: Yeah, they have us packed in a gym, like it’s like, well it’s like in here like sardines. When we were in the dorms, they had us like every other bunk they had inmates on. Now it’s every bunk and they are all on, we're all on lower bunks but we have upper and lower but there’s no one on the top bunk. So, it’s all the bottom bunk, but we're just- it’s just so many men in here that it’s- they might as well reactivate the gym.</br></br>UCI: Right.</br></br>Caller: And this is illegal, they have an actual court order not to have these gyms housing inmates and they’re doing it anyway. And I’m looking across the yard right now because I’m on the facility C and I can see the dorm that I came out, I came out of dorm 16, so it’s like parallel to the gym door and there's nobody in that dorm! So, they're housing us in the gym, but there's a dorm open and available that has been sanitized, so they say.</br></br>I got the PSR, the daily activity status report and it says that they went in and sanitized that building and that dorm so they did that. I’m trying to understand why haven’t they started rehousing men back in to that dorm as opposed to leaving us in an illegal gymnasium. That legally- something that a court order has been, there’s an injunction on housing inmates in the dorm and they’re doing it anyway!</br></br>UCI: Mhmm.</br></br>Caller: [Unintelligible], and they’re doing it anyway. So, anyway, that's basically what’s going on- I’m sure it's way more complicated than the points that I commented on.</br></br>UCI: Yeah.</br></br>Caller: They’re concealing something up here. There’s something going on because they’re not giving me, they’re not giving us adequate information to prove that we’ve actually been infected with COVID-19. They’re telling us we're being forward. We’ve had mild symptoms.</br></br>

Some of us had like loss of taste and smell which is a symptom of COVID. But by in large, it’s just moderate to non-severe symptoms and they’re treating us like we are like in ground zero.</br></br>And it’s kind of panicking people. It’s scaring, you know, older guys, people that are less suspicious of what’s going on. They just kind of accept everything that the medical staff tell them and there’s just something nefarious goin on here. And I'm not sure what your organization can do or are you guys litigators or- ?</br></br>UCI: We’re a research team, so we're collecting as many stories as we can, and then we're gonna be putting them up on our website. So we're not- it’s more like trying to archive and spread these stories so people know what's happening inside these prisons.</br></br>

Caller: Mhmm.</br></br>

UCI: Because obviously like even out here there’s not much information about exactly what’s going on. So, we’re just trying-</br></br>

Caller: Right.</br></br>

UCI: -to collect stories from inmates themselves and kind of publish those so people can understand how awful it’s really been inside.</br></br>Caller: Well, I appreciate that, and I’m gonna do my part. Now what is the website if I wanted my- I have a daughter who could possibly look this up, is there a website and its link? How do I get to that website?</br></br>UCI: Right now, we’re still putting the website up so it’s not like up on a link as of right now because we just started this program recently. But we’re working on the website now and we want to have it up by next month I believe. But-</br></br>Caller: Next month?</br></br>UCI: Yeah, by January.</br></br>Caller: By January 2021? Okay.</br></br>UCI: We do have a PO box where you can write letters to if you'd like to tell us anything else-</br></br>Caller: I would.</br></br>UCI: But- yeah so, did you get one of the letters from us? If not I can tell you our PO box.</br></br>Caller: Yeah, can you give me the PO box?</br></br>UCI: Yeah, the PO box is, so it’s called PrisonPandemic UC Irvine-</br></br>Caller: Prison - Pandemic - UC - Irvine-</br></br>UCI: Yes and then it’s PO box 4430-</br></br>Caller: 4-4-3-0.</br></br>UCI: Yes, and it’s in Sunland, S – U – N – L – A – N -</br></br>Caller: Sunland, California?</br></br>UCI: Yes, Sunland, California. And then the zip code -</br></br>Caller: I used to work in Sun Valley! </br></br>UCI: Oh okay haha. The zip code is 9 - 1 - 0 -</br></br>Caller: 9 - 1 - 0-</br></br>UCI: 4 - 1.</br></br>Caller: 4 - 1. Okay, I got it. So it's, PrisonPandemic UC Irvine, Sunland California, 91041 PO Box 4430?</br></br>UCI: Yes, so if you wanna like write any letters or send any other things you'd like us to know about, you can send it to that PO box and we regularly check that to see whatever we get. As for this call, I- is it okay if I ask you just a couple questions about everything that you told me?</br></br>Caller: Sure, sure.</br></br>UCI: So, I think you told me a lot, it sounds really awful in there right now and I’m so sorry about that. How have you been coping with the crisis, like mentally?</br></br>Caller: Well, mentally I have a- there’s a select group of guys that I play cards, and I read, and I write. And I just kinda take my mind off - I do a lot of sleeping to try and recover and that's basically all that we can do. Those are my coping skills is that I try to deflect to where I’m not really focusing- 'cause it will cause a lot of stress and anxiety.</br></br>

If I just focus on my current condition right now because it’s out of my control. It’s out of my hands and without help or assistance from the outside- it’s like we’re at the mercy of whatever arbitrary decision maker and the prison structure makes and we’re at their mercy.</br></br>UCI: Right.</br></br>Caller: And so I try not to be confrontational with them. I just observe, I document, and I report what I see. And you know I just kinda keep record, and that's the strength that I draw from.</br></br>UCI: Another question I have is, how has the COVID-19 situation at your facility affected your loved ones?</br></br>Caller: Well, it hasn’t really affected them directly because I been on - this is my third year and you know they have their issue and they have their problems that they're going through. My daughter is 30, she’s in a situation where she has to move and she’s moving right in the middle of a pandemic. She's a County Inspector down in Los Angeles County and she's under pressure.</br></br>

I have a mother whose 75 and suffers from some mental health issues, that’s causing pressure. I can’t say it's directly related to this pandemic, but legitimately it’s putting a strain on my family. I have a small family, I have my mother, my daughter, and my granddaughter.</br></br>UCI: Mhmm.</br></br>Caller: She has a 6 year old, so she's like have to take her to school. She’s in a private school which is a commute in the opposite direction of her job. My daughter’s having some complications with her grandmother. They’re not getting along emotionally- there’s a daily stress and hostility in the household and she wants to move out cause it’s not healthy for the baby and it’s overwhelming.</br></br>UCI: Mhmm.</br></br>Caller: All this puts pressure on my thinking, on how I get through my day.</br></br>UCI: Right.</br></br>Caller: [Unitelligible] to say I have to do what I have to do to get through this to make it back for their sake. </br></br>UCI: Mhmm.</br></br>Caller: I mean that’s how-</br></br>UCI: Yeah. So, what do you think could make the situation at your facility better? Like, what would you like to see them do to help you and to help others in the facility? </br></br>Caller: I’d like to see cameras in the facility, I’d like to see public interaction in the facility. I’d like to see academics having access to the isolationism, to the authoritarianism that we suffer through here.</br></br>UCI: Mhmm.</br></br>Caller: 'Cause, we’re isolated! And whenever you- I mean it's just the mechanism for abuse is isolationism. So we’re people’s grandfathers, uncles, cousins, brothers, and sons.</br></br>

And the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation is isolating us from our families and from the public and from society, and it’s the mechanism for abuse! And that's exactly what they're doing! Yeah, hello?</br></br>UCI: Yes.</br></br>Caller: Yes! So, that's exactly what they’re doing, they’re isolating us and then they’re abusing us. And now we don’t have- we can't visit our families, we have limited telephone calls. And I’d like to see more outside participation from the public who- and this is the irony in this, is that the public pays for these, this place.</br></br>UCI: Right.</br></br>Caller: This is a public funded prison.</br></br>UCI: Mhmm.</br></br>Caller: These guards are paid by taxpayers but yet, the public entity, the public, people can’t come into the prison!</br></br>

UCI: Mhmm.</br></br>

Caller: They don’t give them access, so if the public doesn’t have access to something that they’re paying for that’s, you know, [unintelligible] just asking for trouble and it’s just no oversight.</br></br>UCI: Right.</br></br>Caller: When you have no oversight. They can just basically do what they want to do and when they write the report. Any way they wanna write the report and it sticks!</br></br>UCI: Mhmm.</br></br>Caller: They’re law enforcement! They get the benefit of the doubt. They get the benefit of professional courtesy and it’s just not right!</br></br>UCI: Right.</br></br>Caller: Well to answer that question, more public intervention, more cameras, more news media, more intellectuals, more academics, more psychiatrists, and psychology majors and students in here to saturate this place and bring some attention to what they’re doing here.</br></br>UCI: Right. Alright, so we have a couple more minutes. Is there anything else that you would like to share that you want people to know?</br></br>Caller: I think I covered most of it, there’s probably a lot of stuff that I’d like to say and shit I only prepared an agenda for, to get this stuff out. But I will be writing and I will be in contact with this post office box. So yes, as things develop I will be writing and giving additional information and as well, I’ll call.</br></br>UCI: Okay, great! Yeah, I’m really glad to hear that and if you’d like you can also consider telling your friends about us and they can call in as well. Just so we can get as many stories shared as we can.</br></br>Caller: Okay, now how do I go about getting a newsletter or a pamphlet or something about your organization about what you guys are doing?</br></br>UCI: I am not sure we are sending those out right now. Or yet I mean because we- again, like I said, we just started a couple months ago, not even, collecting these stories. What I would suggest is probably just writing to us and you know saying, I would like to - once we start sending those out to receive those, because we definitely do go through all of the letters.</br></br>

So like we would know for sure that you’d like to just to hear back from us.</br></br>Caller: Right, I see that.</br></br>UCI: Yeah.</br></br>Caller: I see things are developing. Exactly, that's exactly what I would like-</br></br>UCI: Okay great.</br></br>Caller: Interaction.</br></br>UCI: Yeah.</br></br>Caller: Okay. Yeah so for now, that's about it. I think I touched on some pretty sensitive points here. There’s there’s some other issues that I’d like to talk to you about. But that doesn’t deal with the pandemic and what’s going on currently right now and dealing with this emergency situation that we’re in.</br></br>UCI: Mhmm.</br></br>Caller: We can get to other issues later.</br></br>UCI: Yeah, you can definitely write to us about those, but since we’re almost out of time I just wanna say thank you so much for sharing everything you shared. It’s really helpful and I wanna thank you for participating and I really hope that you stay safe and that things do get better for you guys in there.</br></br>Caller: Okay, well I appreciate that, and I will be in contact. I obviously it has to be okay to put my name and number on any written correspondence but you have my first name at the beginning of this recording, you're gonna omit that out-?
