Hello PrisonPandemic,</br></br>

Thank you for your letter of concern pertaining to my health and living conditions during this time. I am so happy that you all have raised the question.</br></br>

Truthfully, the pandemic within the walls of this prison (CSP Sacramento) has been a very dire and highly stressful environment, which has given birth to anxiety and depression. We are forced to share a cell with other inmates, cells which, very small and do not provide the standard space required for social distancing.</br></br>

Often times, people are breaking pandemic protocol, not wearing a mask, and are in group gatherings, inmates as well as correctional officers. I am already a person who suffers from depression and anxiety, so the collective behavior, as well as how the rules are applied, create an environment of toxicity.</br></br>

Reduced visitation is absolutely a factor in this matter. They’ve tried to accommodate us with establishing a video visiting program but it’s not enough. For me, it has been very challenging during the duration of this pandemic. This battle with COVID-19 seems to be a perpetuating new normal.</br></br>

Vaccines have been distributed, inmates are taking them but there are some people who will not take the vaccine because of their concerns of effectiveness, inmates as well as correction officers, and even some medical staff.</br></br>

I‘ve taken the vaccine, but I even worry about how the vaccine will effect my body in the long run. Since I’ve received my second shot I’ve been experiencing some problems with blurred vision, headaches, and fatigue. I was given the Pfizer vaccine, so I’ve been concerned about how well it would work, because, according to the new, there’s been talks of a third vaccine dose as a boost for effectiveness. Sorry if makes you worry.</br></br>

As I’ve stated, thank you again for your concerns and interest to the matter of the pandemic within the walls of prison. I hope I’ve provide enough to give you the insight you needed. Thank you!</br></br>

Respectfully.
