The COVID to me is a little hard to understand. We don't know what it is like out there. We are sequestered behind prison gates, we barely social distance, only wear the mask when absolutely necessary, and can live with up to eight girls in one room. We are the safest we can be which is quite funny because we are the ones in trouble and people on the streets are suffering and exposed.</br></br>

My safety inside here is like being in a bubble suit. The only way we can be exposed is by a staff testing positive which means whether they work in the units, the kitchen, the canteen, etc. everyone around them get quarantined. Currently five buildings are on quarantine, 505, 508, 513, 514, 515. Besides that, my safety is fantastic.
