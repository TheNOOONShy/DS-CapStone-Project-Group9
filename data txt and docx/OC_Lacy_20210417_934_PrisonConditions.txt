First and for most thank you for reaching out to us as inmates. My name is [redacted]. Life behind these walls are crazy, scary, and a waste of time. I have been coming to jail and prison all my life. And never have I experienced a time like this during a crisis. COVID-19. As of right now we get no visits, no hot meals, and we are housed with people who have been tested with COVID who are positive. Its scary to know that! My celly can be tested in here for COVID-19, and come back positive and I remain living with this person.</br></br> Two months ago, judge Pete Wilson of the Superior Court ordered sheriff Don Barnes to release inmates due to COVID-19, cause jails are packed to slow the spread of COVID, and that wasn’t met. Don Barnes appealed it and lost. For a man in Don Barnes’ position if you were asked by a (superior) honorable judge- who sits in a seat at the judicial system table, you would do as asked for the safety of the inmates right off the bat. Don Barnes, appealed it, that shows me as an inmate, that Don Barnes doesn’t give two shits about us as inmates and doesn’t care about his position at the table of being head of the table for the Orange County sheriff’s department.</br></br>As for your question; (how does it feel during this time being in here) it’s scary. It’s caused me (ptsd) constantly in fear of it. Ima get COVID-19 due to being housed with inmates who have caught COVID – and Don Barnes does nothing to help the problem. I’m stressed out , all the time, we get sack meals all day for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. The 2,000 diet calorie it’s not even met, we are malnourished. Not eating healthy, so many of our Constitutional rights are being violated and its hard for us to do anything cause the moment we seek help, the sheriffs and their crew harass the fuck out of us and break more of our Constitutional rights to keep our mouths shut.
