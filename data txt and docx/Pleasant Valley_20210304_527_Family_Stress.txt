This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Pleasant Valley.</br></br>3) What has it been like to have reduced visitation from family and loved ones?</br></br>It’s been one of the hardest things that I’ve gone through since I started doing my time. I haven’t seen my family for over a year. I also have a 13-year-old daughter that I haven’t seen since the COVID-19 hit the prison and we went on lockdown. It breaks my heart just writing about it.</br></br>I also lost my relationship of four years. To answer the question, it’s been devastating and we’re all hoping that we get our contact visiting back.</br></br>4) How have you been coping with this crisis?</br></br>I’ve been coping with this ugly situation by staying positive no matter what. I constantly read my bible, I constantly pray. I work out five days a week. I’m attending College through distance learning, that’s kept my mind busy.</br></br>I write letters such as this one. I talk to my family on the pay phone at least twice a week. I talk to my daughter once a week. I read books. My thing is to keep my mind busy on positive things. That’s how I’ve been coping with this situation.
