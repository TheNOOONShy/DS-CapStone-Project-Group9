<em>This story was told by a person incarcerated at San Joaquin County Jail.</br></br></em>

It's titled Hate. It's sort of like a reverse psychology, little haiku sort of poem but not really written in that form. But, okay. So, it's called Hate.</br></br>

I hate the way this year has been. I hate this Christmas. I hate last Thanksgiving. I hate being in jail through it all. I hate time itself. I hate having no control over anything in here. I hate the system. I hate being helpless. I hate being useless. I hate being forced to be alive when I didn't ask for any of this. I hate death, always knowing it's coming someday but never having a choice as to when.</br></br>

I hate COVID for taking so much from us. I hate being me. I hate when love is lost. I hate lack of sympathy. I hate lack of empathy. I hate when things go wrong. I hate imprisonment. I hate suffering. I hate not being able to end all suffering. I hate what's become of our society. I hate making mistakes. I hate not learning from those mistakes.</br></br>

I hate people hating me. I hate bad people. I hate what I'm doing. I hate unfairness. I hate not getting another chance. I hate youth slowly slipping away. I hate people hurting me. I hate turning the other cheek. I hate being so strong but feeling so weak. I hate being away from my beautiful children through the holidays. I hate myself for letting it happen. But mostly I hate hating, and I hate hate.</br></br>

And that's that one. What time is it? Yeah, I'm doing okay. I have something else I want to tell you about COVID. I have a way to cure it and stop all the deaths from happening, but it's a little complicated and it'll take about five to ten minutes to explain. Now that I've now had COVID and I've studied it well, it's something that attacks you mostly in your sleep.</br></br>

And by inducing coma and keeping people bedridden, their preexisting conditions are hijacked by COVID, and they're enraged. And [unintelligible] overnight causes death. But, otherwise, if you keep them pretty much active and feed them through the day, make them sit up and just deal with the pain or whatever their preexisting condition is, then they stand a chance of surviving it. But I'll go more into that tomorrow when I call back with more time. It's stopping any second now.
