Dear PrisonPandemic,</br></br>

Yes, your letter did find me in great health. I hope my reply finds you in great health as well. Yes, being in prison is not easy, and has its daily challenges, but I know being out there in society, and all I have to do to survive our capitalistic society is a whole lot harder.</br></br>

We are all slaves to our American capitalistic grind. You, being a young college student, probably know this all too well, and I don’t know you, but I’m proud of that path you are on, and send much love and respect to you, young lady.</br></br>

My daughter graduated two years ago this May with her bachelor's in sociology. I believe she is pursuing her master's. So proud of her.</br></br>

Well, I’m here at Susanville State Prison temporarily. I’m a firefighter, and should be going back to fire camp when fire season starts up soon. I was at Konocti Fire Camp last fire season for 10 months, and came back to Susanville for getting caught with a cell phone, stupid mistake. But if everything works out, I should be going to another fire camp soon.</br></br>

It was a record-setting fire season last year, and this upcoming fire season is predicted to be a whole lot worse. Last year, I was on fires for 97 days straight. We put in 2,100 hours, we being my crew and me.</br></br>

It was very challenging, but very rewarding at the same time. Especially when you save people’s houses, or whole neighborhoods sometimes. People are very appreciative, and thank us with signs, or letters they mail to our camp. One gentleman drove up to us crying, and expressed to us how grateful he was for us saving his cabin out in the Mendocino Woods. Very rewarding experience.</br></br>

I do have a story that I would like to share that might not seem too serious to some, but really upset me when it happened; on more than one occasion, no less. Well, the story starts like this, we had to isolate due to the fact that a couple people in my dorm tested positive for COVID-19 in late February.</br></br>

Each dorm holds about 32 people, but 24 is the maximum they are putting in each dorm due to COVID-19. They are leaving eight dorms empty at all times. So when someone tests positive, protocol is for non-positive people to isolate on another yard (the Lassen Yard) for two weeks in two-man cells.</br></br>

The people who tested positive stay in the dorm, or move to another dorm on the yard from which we left. They isolate as well, until they are symptom-free, and test negative.</br></br>

Anybody who tests positive on the Lassen Yard during the time we are there will be moved back to our original yard (Cascade) and isolate, and have to start their two weeks over again, and get tested daily, and come off isolation when they are symptom-free, and test negative. And if they have a cellmate who tested negative, he has to start his isolation all over again in his cell alone.</br></br>

Well, when we are at Lassen Yard, isolating, the nurses come in twice a day to take our temps, and to ask us if we have any other symptoms, and to periodically COVID test us via nasal swab. During these visits, prisoners will ask them if they should get the COVID shot, or ask them information about the shot.</br></br>

For FYI I have had the shot, both shots (Moderna). I believe in the vaccine, and as a 53 year-old man, wanted all the protection I could get. So when they offered the vaccine, I did not hesitate. Very grateful to be able to obtain the vaccine knowing that some countries are not gonna receive them for some time, or it’s gonna be difficult for them to obtain the vaccine.</br></br>

Listen to a lot of NPR Radio (LOL). We are a very spoiled country!</br></br>

Well, back to my story, when the nurse was asked this question, she gave the most uneducated answer, along with the correctional officer. They would say that COVID was not real, and the vaccine was a fraud, that they did not get the vaccine.</br></br>

You could definitely tell that they were stating their political views rather than an educated answer pertaining to a sincerely-asked question. Or even no answer would have been better, telling the inmate that that’s a personal choice he has to make, and that I would not want my answer to influence him either way. Or my decision to get the vaccine influence his decision either.</br></br>

But to say the vaccine and pandemic is fake, or that it’s overly exaggerated by the media, or by the government (that is, Democrats), left-wing conspiracy? Really? (LOL) Really upset me, because I know this COVID-19 virus is not serious for some people, but could be very serious for others, especially people with pre-existing conditions, like asthma.</br></br>

I have a friend who is my age, but still plays baseball (hardball) in a league. I mean he is very healthy who got COVID-19, and was in a medically-induced coma for two weeks due to respiratory difficulties. He is fine now, thank God. But if he would of got the vaccine, maybe he could of been able to fight the virus more effectively, or maybe not caught it at all.</br></br>

So for some of these nurses, and even correctional officers to answer these questions about the vaccine in this manner, is both professionally and ethically wrong. Very irresponsible behavior by a medical professional. What do you think?</br></br>

This happened on more than one occasion, on Cascade Yard and at Lassen Yard when we were quarantined in late February, and early March. I have been COVID-free, and I would like to think it’s because I decided to get vaccinated.</br></br>

Well, thank you for your letter, and I hope this letter was what you were looking for in the story. It felt good to get it off my chest. My frustration has been pent up for awhile, thanks for being my outlet. Take care and God bless. Hope to hear from you soon. You can post this with my name if you like. So be strong, and much prayers to you and your journey. Thank you for your letter and taking time to write.
