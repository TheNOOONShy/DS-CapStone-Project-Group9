This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Stockton.</br></br>

Around June, I had breathing issues and was sent to the infirmary. I was given an EKG and the nurse told me that there was a bit of a concern per the doctor as to the results, but there would be a follow up. No follow up was done.</br></br>

I submitted another medical request asking for an x-ray of my chest because I knew something wasn’t right and my breathing had to improve. The doctor told me that he doesn’t want to expose me to radiation unless it is necessary, so he concluded that I may have constipation and prescribe me two weeks of constipation medication.</br></br>

10 days later I was feeling worse. I submitted another medical request and begged the nurse at triage to give me an x-ray. The nurse got approval from the doctor to give me an x-ray and it reflected that I had an enlarged heart. I was immediately transferred to Banner Hospital in Susanville where I was omitted and stayed there for seven days.</br></br>

When I got back to the prison I told the doctor there that I am requesting an immediate transfer to a medical facility because there were positive COVID-19 cases, and now that I knew and they knew I had a serious heart condition, I was afraid that I might be positive if I remain there. The doctor told me that all transfers were on hold due to COVID-19, but as soon as it lifts I would be transferred.</br></br>

What made no sense to me was that CDC (California Department of Corrections) was approving transfers for inmates coming from San Quentin to Susanville that were eligible to be firefighters. Inmates who were later determined positive for COVID-19, not all of them, but some of them.
