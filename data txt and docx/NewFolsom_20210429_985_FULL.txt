Hello!</br></br>

I just got this letter from you guys and to be honest I've never even heard of anything like this before or of anyone getting a letter like this. I'm not even sure why I'm responding, it just seems really odd but I don't have much to do right now. Actually that's not true, I have a ton of homework for my sociology courses plus I draw a lot and take self-help through the mail.</br></br>

I have changed a lot over the last two years and decided I don't want to be in here forever. But prior to these two years I thought I was ready to spend my life in here. I now know I have wasted my life in here and making bad decisions.</br></br>

So I started to draw and have gotten pretty good. Someone is about to set up an online art shop for me to sell my drawings, I also started college. I'm in my second semester and now I take self-help classes. I can feel that my mind set has changed and I feel more positive each day and focus on these things every day now.</br></br>

I came to prison when I was 21 and being in prison didn't change much for me as far as my thinking and staying out of trouble. All this was or is, is a place with a bunch of other people just like me, same thinking, same goals, and none good.</br></br>

It took me picking up a new case in 2019 and sitting in the hole and missing my out date again. The third time to see how stupid I have been and realize I've wasted my life in here.</br></br>

The best years of my life gone, no life experiences, no memories, no girlfriend. OH ya, I forgot to mention I'm married but my ex left me as soon as I got arrested. So seven years now and I haven't heard from her.</br></br>

My mom use to come visit me even though its seven hours to here from where she lives. But I haven't seen her since January of 2020 because of the pandemic. And even now we have contact visits again but they are only one hour and you need to show a negative COVID test from within 72 hours of the visit. But you can't use a rapid test, it has to be a real test, which I've been told normally takes five days to get a response on.</br></br>

To be honest its a lot harder not having no one to talk to. Having no visits sucks and we were told we would get tablets so we could video chat with our people and email back and forth but that hasn't happened yet.</br></br>

I feel safe, there's no reason for me not to. And phone calls would make a huge difference too but we only get 15 minutes each day and you'll be lucky to get that 15 min. It seems like there's always something that gets in the way for us to get that call plus it depends on the C/O. Everyone runs program different some are ok and don't give you a hard time.</br></br>

The vaccines were offered to anyone that wanted it. I got the Pfizer two shots, two weeks apart. I felt fine.</br></br>

"How have you been coping with the crisis?" I wake up every day at 4:45am and by 5:30am I'm either drawing, working on my college courses or my self help classes. Since I started drawing I've felt the sense of achievement and that led to getting into college and other things.</br></br>

I stay busy all day working on one or the other until 9am or 12am. I hope to get out soon despite the new case. I'm staying positive and hopeful. Please do not put my name or CDC# or cell# with this if you use it. I appreciate it and thank you for this letter it felt good to know others are thinking of me in some way, shape or form.</br></br>

Do you guys help out with pen pals? If so, I would love to have someone to talk to or if not it's all good. I hope you are all doing good and take care.
