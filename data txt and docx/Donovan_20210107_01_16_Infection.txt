This story was told by a person incarcerated at Donovan.</br></br>

Caller: I, who has tested on December 15th negative, contracted COVID by December 17th. And I went man down on December 20th at approximately 7:45 p.m. When I went man down, the nurse came and see me, took my vitals and oxygen levels, and she told me, in unknown certain terms, that the infirmary was overloaded with inmates. And that she, there was really nothing that she could do for me.</br></br>

She couldn't provide any medication. I told her I was, I couldn't breathe. I was dizzy, vomiting, had fever, chills. She suggested to me that I go back to my cell and if it got worse to go man down again.</br></br>

She then did something outrageous. She asked me to file a medical refusal form, which was blank and that she would put in there that I was reporting food poisoning. And then, that's exactly what she did.</br></br>

Then sent me back to my housing unit knowing that I was COVID infected. This occurred in this building — unit four — several times. Other inmates experienced the same thing.
