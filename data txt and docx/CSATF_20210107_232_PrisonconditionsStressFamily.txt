It has been a real struggle in here during this whole COVID pandemic. It has been absolutely crazy these last few months inside of here. The reason being, is because at the very beginning of this whole thing, this institution could’ve had everything under control. But due to too many chiefs and not enough Indians, a massive breakout was the result.</br></br>

The custody staff had us wearing cloth like loose-fitting mask, which was not proper PPE. They told the staff to wear mask, but didn’t implement it or force it, so staff was walking around with no mask or not proper PPE, which in return exposed us to this COVID virus. These staff here acted like we were the ones that can infect them, but the truth was the opposite.</br></br>

So I sit here writing to you as a two-time COVID survivor, wondering why did they start moving infected inmates to other buildings? Why did they move infected inmates to other yards? Or why did they take one inmate out the cell saying that he was positive, move another inmate in with the one that stayed?</br></br>

This all seems like careless people not knowing what to do and listening to some people in Sacramento to which they put all the blame. They treated us like cattle or animals to say, looking from inside out, it’s all about money. While all the things they were doing was totally unlawful and reckless, jeopardizing my life and thousands more.</br></br>

It has been hard on my mental state not being able to have visits from family and friends. Luckily I have a job and keep my mind going, but when we were on complete lockdown, I struggled bad. All of a sudden, a year down from when this COVID outbreak started, they have recently started letting us receive one video visit a month.</br></br>

So I’ve learned a lot of coping mechanisms during this time. Such as exercise which reduces stress a lot, meditation, writing letters to our loved ones in society, and reading. We have to keep our mind sharp no matter what.
