What has it been like to be inside during this time?</br></br>

When I seen on the news about a virus that is spreading around the world that attacks the respiratory system I was like “what the fuck is going on.” That’s something out of a movie or in a book. I thought about my family and if they will be safe, then I thought it wouldn’t make it close home. Then it was everywhere and people started to die.</br></br> 

I’m thankful that none of my family members that I’m in contact with contracted the virus so far in this pandemic.</br></br>

Mandatory mask and six feet distance and all that and it still spreads like the wildfires. Being incarcerated while all this is going on has left me feeling useless to my family. Knowing that my grandma could die from this virus if she caught it while going to the store for food. And I can’t be there to do all that for her or any of my other elderly family is a messed up feeling.</br></br>

Since we know that our elders and certain other people fall under that high risk of death and hospitalization of the virus it should be the low-risk individuals that take care of them. And not being able to do that because I got myself in prison would mess me up if one of my family died. All I can do from my situation is hope and pray for everyone to make it out safely.</br></br>

How do you feel about your safety inside?</br></br>

I thought it wouldn’t make it into the prison. Then the news said correctional staff tested positive in another prison close by. Then rumors go around about staff looking sick and coughing. Some staff haven’t came back to work in a couple days.</br></br>

The one morning you hear over the loud speaker “COVID testing” and I’m getting a swab shoved deep into my nostril. Couple days later, you got nurses decked in PPE in the building saying we’re on quarantine because people tested positive. After two weeks of quarantine, we get yard so people go ask those individuals that had tested positive how was it.</br></br>

As time went on, more positive cases and more quarantine. They passed out to inmates these cloth masks and told us to wear them at all times when we come out our cells. But it wasn’t enforced and some staff wouldn’t wear masks so slowly no one wore masks. Then new COVID-19 cases and now they want to turn a building into the quarantine building.</br></br> 

Some inmates that tested positive moved and others refused to move and left among us. Because they didn’t enforce the “who test positive or have symptoms must move to the quarantine building to lower the spread and contact.”</br></br>

One day in September 2020, I start having symptoms. I wouldn’t complete my workouts because I would get exhausted quickly, crazy headaches, and unusually tired. I’d just want to sleep. They escorted me from medical to the quarantine building where I was put in a cell.</br></br> 

Later, my TV and property came.</br></br>

While in quarantine, the only time we seen staff or medical staff was when they brought our breakfast and dinner. And when the medical staff did our vital checks twice a day. So if anyone was having a medical emergency the only way to get staff’s attention was seven in the morning at breakfast, or four in the afternoon during dinner because they don’t come check on us. We’re really isolated from them.</br></br>

After quarantine, back to normal stuff. They didn’t test no one for COVID-19 for several weeks, no quarantine or new cases. So people stop wearing masks and all that safety stuff went out of the window. The inmates who caught the virus all had different experiences.</br></br> 

Some didn’t feel a thing while others said they would run out of breath if they did too much movements.</br></br>

These people don’t give a shit about anyone’s health. I’m talking about both the inmates and staff. You got staff walking around maskless, even medical staff that pass out medication in all the buildings. They’re the ones we come in contact with daily.</br></br> 

So it’s obvious they’re the ones who introduced the virus to the inmate population. Some staff do follow the rules and wear masks and gloves when dealing with us.</br></br> 

For the inmates, some just don’t care because the virus didn’t cause them discomfort or sickness. So they don’t wear a mask or they think they won’t catch it again. Some inmates start having symptoms and refuse the test so they won’t go on quarantine and they continue talking to others and spreading the virus.</br></br>

If the prison really wanted to stop the spread here, they could but they don’t care. That’s what I think. If they test the whole population, staff and inmates, those that refuse should be quarantined also just to be safe. And they should pass out better masks and enforce the masks and social distance on everyone.</br></br>

They should have been passing out more soap to everyone and disinfectant to clean our cells. They told us to do this and that to stay safe but they don’t follow their own rules so inmates stop trying. Somehow I caught the virus again and now I’m on quarantine along with several other inmates. Which they just kept us here in the same section with general population.</br></br> 

Except from taking us to the quarantine building to isolate us.</br></br>

This time the virus really hit me with symptoms. Fever for three days that would have me sweating in my sleep. Shaking chills feeling like I’m freezing, muscle aches, headaches, runny and congested nose, poor appetite, and a weird chest pain if I breath in hard. All they do for me is take my vitals twice a day and leave me confined to my cell.</br></br> 

“If your symptoms get worse then put in a medical slip so we can come see you.”</br></br>

What has it been like to have reduced visitation from family and loved ones?</br></br>

I haven’t seen my family since I came to prison. They kept putting me in prisons far from home. So I’m used to it already but I wouldn’t risk my family’s health just for a visit. I been waiting five years.</br></br> 

I know I can wait more until it’s safe and I’m closer home to them. They did start doing visits over the computers. Everyone gets one every 30 days. I haven’t had one.</br></br>

How have you been coping with this crisis?</br></br>

I’m just trying to keep my health so this virus don’t mess me up bad. I want to make it home to my family so I can be helpful to them in these crazy times. All I can do is continue exercising to get my lungs back in shape and hope and pray my family are safe.</br></br> 

Hopefully once the virus slows down in prison they can allow me to transfer closer to my family. Maybe I will finally get to see them.
