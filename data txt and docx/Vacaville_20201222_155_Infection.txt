This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Vacaville.</br></br>

Hello, </br></br>

I received a surprise letter from y'all and I enjoy writing so I figured I'd reply, â€˜cause quarantine gets pretty boring. I'm a 27-year-old trans women and non-binary person, I prefer she, her, hers, Mrs. I'm Hispanic. My sexual orientation is pansexual. And I am currently engaged to my fiance who's incarcerated at CSATF while I am in a single cell at CMF. I've been locked up for eight years, since I was 19 on a 15 to life sentence.</br></br> 

I've plenty of COVID-19 stories. From March through November, I was at California Institution for Men, otherwise known as Chino State Prison. If you have followed COVID-19 within CDCR, you'll recognize that I survived the COVID-19 outbreak at the prison with the highest death rate in California. Indeed, as of the day I left, Chino had 1700-plus positives and 26 inmate deaths. I made it out testing negative the whole time, only because I went to the hole, ASU administrative segregation.</br></br>

I spent 220 days in ASU at Chino, a horribly torturous place. Lockdown 24/7.
