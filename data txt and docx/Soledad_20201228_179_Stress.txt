Stress
It has been a little confusing I think is the word I would use to describe my feelings. Watching on television and seeing CDCR officials figure out how to go about dealing with this virus and try to protect themselves as well. As you may or may not know there is a certain kind of mentality that exists with both incarcerated, staff and CDCR custody. While watching it seems as if we were all struggling to come to terms with what was happening and learn “at the wrong time” how to get out of each other‘s way. Within these walls it seems as policy is ever evolving. It occurred to me that their isn’t any way to properly deal with something of this magnitude. I thought about this first after CDCR officials pulled me out of my cell to have me call home.
