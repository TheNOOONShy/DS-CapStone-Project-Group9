This story was told by a person incarcerated at Chuckawalla.</br></br>

UCI: So, tell me about your experience, you know, with the pandemic.</br></br>  Caller: Well, being an inmate, we’re restricted to this open living arrangement, and word had got around that, you know, COVID was spreading across the world, and we were doing quite well as a prison for the early months. And being in an enclosed society, we thought we could have, you know, been protected.</br></br> 

But, we have staff that come and go, and we believe that one of those had brought it in, and then it transmitted to some inmates, and then it just went through like a wildfire.</br></br>  I mean, in my building, everybody- I think 90, over 97 percent of the people have been tested positive. There’s been a few, quite a few deaths in the prison. But there’s been quite a few people that had very mild symptoms of the virus.</br></br> 

In a way we were quite lucky because it came at a time prior to this pandemic situation now, where hospitals are at 100 percent capacity. I don’t believe, many of the 250 inmates that did go to hospital, I don’t believe if it happened now, that they would have access to the hospital, and maybe a lot more would have died.</br></br>  Did the process, did the protocol of the prison's authority, was it well run? That’s very questionable. We’ve had, there’s our staff, our custody staff that worked in yards that didn’t have any signs of the virus on one shift, and the next shift they’re working on one of the yards that there is the virus.</br></br> 

And that happened quite often. Then you had the free staff that wandered, went between different yards. So, once it got to the prison, it was - there was no reason why it wouldn’t get to everybody. My yard was one of the last yards, but it happened.
