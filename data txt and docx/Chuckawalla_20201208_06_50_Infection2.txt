This story was told by a person incarcerated at Chuckawalla.</br></br>

Caller: I ended up being negative and I got positive. I got tested positive too. And I came back, ever since I’ve been back, I haven’t been, I haven’t, my normal routine is, it gets, sometimes it gets hard because it gets hard to breathe sometimes. Like, I'm out of breath already just by talking.</br></br>UCI: Yeah. So, would you, I mean you say they’re, right they’re quarantining certain people, kind of. Are they testing you guys, are you guys kind of afraid to be tested because of where you’ll end up? Are they testing, you know, staff?</br></br>Caller: I think they test the staff right. But here’s the thing, okay say I'm, there's people here that are waiting like to go outside medical to get like operations done right. Like for hernias, and stuff like that right.</br></br> 

And when we come back from outside medical, they quarantine us for 14 days right so we don’t get the population sick, so they can control the so-called outbreak. If I'm gonna get quarantined for 14 days so I won’t infect the yard, why don’t the officers get quarantined too? They come directly back to the building.</br></br>UCI: So, the officers are kind of, I mean they get tested right but they aren’t really having to adhere to the same protocol as you guys as, you know, as the general population essentially?</br></br>Caller: Yeah. Pretty much because if they’re gonna quarantine me so I won’t infect the others around me, why don’t they quarantine the officers too instead of letting them come directly back to work. I mean you should see some of these guys they’re, like super pale. There's an old guy that works here like four days out of the week. That guy’s like super pale, he coughs everywhere and he’s old you know. He’s like an older guy.
