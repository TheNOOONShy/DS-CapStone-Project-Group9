Hello,                                                                         May 26, 2021</br></br>


My name is [redacted]. I’m currently housed at [redacted] in San Diego, CA. An inmate [redacted] whom I believe you’ve been in contact with gave me your contact information and advised me to contact you concerning the COVID-19 outbreak we had in our yard. I don’t want to go into a long untargeted story about the event, so I'll give you some general key information and events that I think will be helpful for any questions you may have. </br></br>


During and after the outbreak I was the [redacted] Counsel (I.A.C.) [REDACTED] FAC. (Meaning I coordinate and address the climate population concerns to the Prison Administration Official (Correctional staff-sgt., Lt. Capt. [redacted] and Warden, etc…). We alert staff on Dec. 6th, 2020 that inmate (i/m) [redacted] was exhibiting signs of COVID-19 infection, (which they did nothing). Dec. 12, 2020 two of my cellmates [redacted] and [redacted] both tested positive for COVID-19 (In which staff didn’t move them into a “Quarantine or Isolation” cell/area until Dec.18,2020).Dec. 19, 2021; I was told I tested positive for COVID-19.</br></br>


In Dec. 2021 I filed a Correctional [redacted]-FAC-E and Medical Grievance #RJD-[REDACTED] (Both of which has been sent to sacramento for a final review.). I have Declaration from all aforementioned inmates and in-depth knowledge of the system failures that made this outbreak possible. Thank you very much for your time, if you have any questions, please feel free to contact me at the address on the envelope or leave a message with my wife Mrs.[redacted].</br></br>


Sincerely, [redacted]
