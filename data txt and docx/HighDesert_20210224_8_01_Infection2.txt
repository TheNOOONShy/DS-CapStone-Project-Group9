UCI: What could your facility do to make the situation better in your opinion?</br></br>

Caller: Well I mean the thing is, they need to train the staff better because one of the main things is that a lot of staff believe that corona is nothing and come here with no masks or touching stuff. They’ll hand us trays, touching our food trays, and they’ll say “corona isn’t shit, corona isn’t there” right so that’s one of the things is the way people perceive it, they see it as a joke.</br></br> 

And if they were to see it more as a serious issue then that would be one ways- one of the forms in which they could correct their actions and be able to manage this better.
