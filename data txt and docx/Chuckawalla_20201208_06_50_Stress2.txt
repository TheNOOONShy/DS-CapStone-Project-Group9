Caller: It's scary, you know, because here there's really not much they can do for you. So, it's a scary thing. It's, I've never seen nothing like this, the whole time I’ve been down. It's pretty frightening.</br></br>UCI: Yeah, there's a lot of uncertainty and your, and throughout the whole facility right you know I mean your facility didn’t have any outbreaks and then they started, it sounds like they started moving people, not just they started moving not just you know inmates-, but also staff as well, so do you feel that contributed to a lot of it, moving people around?</br></br>Caller: Yes. That was a big factor in it, you know. Not keeping us in the yard by ourselves. They just kept bringing people in from different other yards.
