For a place filled with killers and criminals, lying and stealing is not tolerated. Kinda sick huh? We "sheltered in cell" since March and as I mentioned earlier we worried more about people outside than of ourselves in here. We as convicts are used to being treated like shit, like caged animals.</br></br>

You wrote about positive prison reforms, to be totally blunt with you that's the funniest shit I've ever heard. There's no such thing as "prison reforms". We're treated like shit and the justice system in California is a joke.</br></br>

I was found guilty so I deserve my punishment. But as a legal clerk in the prison library I've seen prisoners that weren't guilty or didn't deserve the sentence imposed by the courts. I am one of the biggest critics of the CDCR, there is so much corruption and cover-up in here you'd think we were in prison in a third world country. So when the pandemic hit do you think they did anything positive for us that we didn't fight for?</br></br>

The company that runs our phone system here would give us two days a month with free phone calls. And on those days they'd lock us down denying us access to the phones with some false alleged reason. You'd think our mail would be more prompt and efficient but it got worse than it's usual ineffectiveness.</br></br>

I've logged every bit of incoming and outgoing mail since 2017 because I must routinely write them a grievance once a year so they'll process our mail properly. The mail is my most common and important way of correspondence with my family and friends. So it is of the most utmost important, more than the horrible inedible food or the corruption of the staff.</br></br>

Of course our visits were reduced but unless you're a selfish son of a bitch, why would you want your loved ones exposed to possible infection? So I think our reduced visiting was absolutely correct protocol. But they should have improved our access to phone calls and more efficiently process our mail it is common sense but they (CDCR) didn't come through either.</br></br>

Since supplies were hard to deliver, all our canteens was on a limit which is bad when we go to store once a month. You'd think that our 30 lb. care packages our families order for us would come quicker due to our shortened store list, but even though the COs have less to do since we're shelter in our cells it takes just as long or at times longer.</br></br>

You would never know this if you've never done time or know someone here. My sisters didn't believe at first but they also know that their eldest brother doesn't complain privately. I've been through worse.</br></br>

We stay in our cells normally but with the pandemic protocols we're confined to our cells 21 hours a day. With an infection virus like COVID-19 and pandemic you'd think they'd give us disinfectant but they give us watered down Windex or a degreaser. I must buy disinfectant from the inmate janitors to clean my cell.</br></br>

If I know you as a friend I'd tell you that your whole project is utterly naive if you think you can help reform this prison system. We're treated like cattle and not human. I've seen this place change like stage scenery in a play when an outside entity comes to audit or come see about a complain.</br></br>

CDCR demands at lease 24 hours advance notice (due to security). In that time we're locked down while everything is fixed! We've gotten most of out reforms through hunger strikes and media exposure. Funny how I wrote earlier I had nothing to write about!
