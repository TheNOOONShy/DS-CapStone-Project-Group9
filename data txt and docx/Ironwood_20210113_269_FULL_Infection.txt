Dear PrisonPandemic,</br></br>  

I am currently incarcerated at Ironwood State Prison in Blythe, California. I am writing your organization in hope that you can please help me find a law firm to represent me in filling a lawsuit against CDCR. Last month Ironwood State suffered a major outbreak of COVID-19 virus and I was deliberately exposed and contracted COVID-19 due to CDCR staff not having a curve to what they are doing!</br></br> 

In my building which holds 200 men, 100 cells each, has two men per cell. We were all tested for COVID-19 on 12/26/20, medical staff came back to my building and had 30 inmates COVID-19 tested. When I was told I was one of those 30 inmates being tested including myself had tested negative (all other inmates were positive tests) on 12/22/20 and they were being tested to see if we had got COVID since then due to our cellmates bing positive for COVID-19!</br></br>  

The nurse tested me and said they were rapid COVID-19 tests, and we would be moved immediately if test results were negative for COVID-19 virus due to all our cellmates being positive for COVID-19. Nurse said results were to come back within hours and we would know if we were negative because we would automatically be moved to another building for isolation away from my infected cellmates.</br></br>  

That all happened on 12/26/20 And I was told to go back into my cell. With a cellmate who was known to be positive for COVID-19 by CDCR. They did not let me know anything about my test results until Monday 12/28/20 when a CDCR guard came to my cell and told me to pack my property to move to another building.</br></br> 

I was moved and at the time I was very sick and told guards who were in new building. Medical staff came and gave me my test and they told me my last COVID test was negative and that was why I was moved. But I told them they got me sick by not moving me right away and making me go back into the cell with infected cellmate! On January 1, 2021 I was moved back due to my COVID test on 12/28/20 being positive for COVID-19!</br></br> 

Now I am recovered from COVID-19 but still cannot smell and having cold sweats at night. I am seeking damages from CDCR for deliberately, maliciously infecting me with the COVID-19 virus! I am already quarantined and isolated from society yet CDCR contaminated staff can continuously have contact with us and spread this deadly virus! I have been keeping a daily log on my health and have all my COVID-19 test results but have not filed any sort of grievance due to me afraid of staff assaulting me and moving me around.</br></br> 

Please help me find a law firm or lawyer to represent me to file a lawsuit and get compensation for CDCR infecting me with deadly virus! Please have law firm contact me through mail and I appreciate your help and God bless your organization! Thank you. I look forward to hearing from you soon.</br></br> 

Sincerely.
