This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Mule Creek.</br></br>

I have no one to fight for my mental health needs because mental health and medical are afraid of custody. I’m trying to have medical place me in the completor on SOMS to show that I’m high risk for COVID-19 because I’m asthmatic. But I’m being denied six months to see my medical doctor.</br></br> 

My mom's name is [redacted].</br></br>

I’m enclosing a form from medical which CDC staff says it's not valid unless it’s in SOMS.
