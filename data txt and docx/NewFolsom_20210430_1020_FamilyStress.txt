This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Folsom.</br></br>
You know I have family members on the street. Who have been protected by the awesome hand of God. And his love and grace has also kept me. I’ve seen and heard about a few people that have contracted the virus. And, it’s not a pretty sight. It’s truly nothing one can do once they’ve been infected by such a disease. The vaccinations are another thing. They’re saying everyone should be and could be vaccinated.</br></br>
I know, the media does not publish every source of information that they may come across. So, the blood clots they speak of pertaining to the vaccinations I say, who knows what may be ahead though? Because, there was really never any test phase. It just came straight from production to patients. There was supposed to be an in between period.</br></br>
To run the proper tests to gauge and better understand the medications that would provide. That never happened though. So, these health risks to be vaccinated is another slippery slope. With these things in place, I had to think about [redacted]. I had to find out what is best for [redacted]?</br></br>
Because in prison,  the best scenario for me was to stay quarantined in a cell by myself, to insure that I could beat this thing. For this is a very very serious time in American history. There has never been such a heat wave as COVID-19. And, there is always going to be people out there with COVID-19. So, where do we go from here? The way it’s looking is, COVID-19 may cause mankind to become separatists to a degree. We’ll see the COVID vaccinations are going great in the prison. They’ve done a good job at keeping the inmate population from getting totally infected. Although, there were some cases on both sides.</br></br>
