This story was told by a person incarcerated at San Bernardino Central Detention Center.</br></br>

Caller: This is the closest I've been to anybody since COVID started. It is quite shocking to me. I'm in SM - and that's serious mental illness.</br></br>

I don't know why I'm here, but my background that I have. But I do know we just came off of quarantine on Thursday. There are no masks forced - enforced in this pod.</br></br>

Two weeks ago, when we were placed on quarantine, we were complaining that our toilet was backed up, and we needed help getting it cleaned out. We have three toilets, and they were filled to the brim with poop. I went to the nurse and complained to them that that was the condition and people were pooping.</br></br> 

We were sick, sick, sick in here. I don't know what we have, but everybody was sick, and we were pooping in the shower. That was the only place that wasn't left to go.</br></br>

We are being malnourished. We are not being fed appropriately from the jail. The jail likes us to fight and treats us like lions in a den, and they like to use us as free entertainment. If we're in a fight and beat up, which I was by five people, they don't do anything for you.
