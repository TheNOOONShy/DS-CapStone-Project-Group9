My experience here in the county jail during this pandemic has somewhat been brutal and an eye-opener to how inhuman assistant and how people can be.
<br><br> 
From my eyes, I've seen it like ran like a concentration camp. It brings to mind the movie Schindler's List. It's very sad but it's very true. When you first come into the jail you go to a medical booth and asked to answer all the COVID questions, if you have trouble breathing, if you have a cough, if you have a loss of taste or a fever. They take your temperature and all this being done like you already have COVID. Then when you enter the jail we are all put together in numerous cells with no 6 feet social distancing at all. Then you go into a quarantine process of 2 week supposedly, in a cell by yourself and others with a cellmate, they come and test you at least two to three times a week, then when you are cleared it's like they forget about you. I was stuck in a cell by myself for over a month after being cleared for two weeks.

There are people who have been there longer. We are stuck without visits, 30 minutes out of our cells to take a shower or use to talk on a phone to our families. We have gone a year without visits, we just recently got once a month visit going on. To my understanding I donâ€™t why once a month, when all of our visits are behind a glass. Our families are worried about us as we are equally worried about them. These deputies get to go home to their families, and we don't.

I understand we put ourselves in jail, but to take that privilege of seeing our families away even though they're behind a glass, it's cruel, and I would not wish that upon my worst enemy. This experience has opened my eyes to a lot of things. Especially on the emotional side.
