Caller: Okay, cause they wrote me a letter.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: They told me, they told me to call this number if I wanted to speak to them. And so that’s why I was calling this number. Is there any kind of way that I can, I wrote them a letter back, but, you know, I was wondering if there’s any kind of way that I can speak to them.</br></br>

UCI: No, you can’t speak to them, like, directly cause there’s never no direct answer for when you can speak to somebody at the right time for their shift. But this line is for you to call and be able to tell your story, so if you want to tell your story, anything different from what you wrote in the letter, we could begin the process.</br></br>

Caller: Okay, well, I only have seven minutes left on my time but, you know, if there’s, if there’s anything that you are, you want me to answer I will.</br></br>

UCI: Okay, well before we start we, I have to read a consent process, is that okay?</br></br>

UCI: So what, what facility are you currently housed at?</br></br>

Caller: I'm in Salinas Valley, in Salinas Valley.</br></br>

UCI: And what has the COVID situation been like at your facility?</br></br>

Caller: Well, I have taken two COVID-19 tests and I was negative on both of them and, you know, but I have seen a lot of dudes that was sick and, you know, not able to, you know, be successful and, you know, this COVID-19.</br></br>

UCI: Hm, and since they have been vaccinating others, how has the vaccination situation been like at Salinas Valley.</br></br>

Caller: Happened, you know, pretty good, I mean, I've been a little stressful, you know, because, you know, behind, you know, there are COVID-19, you know, you worry about whether or not you positive or negative, and stuff like that.</br></br>

Then I have felt family members’ deaths on the street that I worry about getting them and stuff like that, you know. But you know, other than that, you know, it's been pretty good.</br></br>

UCI: And so have they been offering the vaccine to everyone there?</br></br>

Caller: Yes, they have, to be honest, yes they have.</br></br>

UCI: OK, that's good, and what have you been doing to be able to cope with the crisis?</br></br>

Caller: Well, I mean I'll, I'll work out and I'm a ADA caretaker, you know, so you know, my job prescribes me to, to take care of you know the ADA patients.</br></br>

UCI: Mhm, and so since there have been changes, where has it been like for you to have reduced visitation and programming?</br></br>

Caller: I haven't been able to have any visitations yet because I'm, I'm still waiting on the visiting to approve my visitors, and you know, it's been like three weeks and now they kind of like backed up on that.</br></br>

UCI: Mhm. So, what would you say that your facility could do to make the situation better in regards to COVID-19?</br></br>

Caller: Uhm, I think that they should, you know allow people more time to, you know, to be able to speak to they family and then you know, try to, you know, be more quicker at approving visitors and stuff like that.</br></br>

UCI: Okay, that's a good thing to know. What else did you want the people to know about your experience?</br></br>
