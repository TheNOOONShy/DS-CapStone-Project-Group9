This story was told by a person incarcerated at an ICE/Private-Contractor facility.</br></br>

Caller: It seems like this place is running as normal. There's really not much of that taken into consideration, it doesn't seem like to me at least.</br></br>

UCI: That's incredible, dude.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah.</br></br>

UCI: And how has it been- you said, you were talking a little bit about it's tough dealing with your loved ones on the outside dealing with COVID. And you're on the inside, can't do anything.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, it's very difficult.</br></br>

UCI: And not that you can't do anything, but you know what I mean. Sorry.</br></br>

Caller: Well, the worst part is I came from another institution. And in the other places where I was at, like in the state prison and county jail, over there, they had already opened up to allow our visitors to come in and see us. And to hear they're not allowing us, I don't understand why.</br></br>

UCI: Not allowing visitors? Okay.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah. They're not allowing our visits. And the only way that we could talk to them is, basically, over the phone. They have a system that's available. There's some tablets to facetime, but it's really bad. It cuts out. You can't really see them.</br></br>

UCI: That's not right.

Caller: My parents are very. They're older, and they struggle with stuff like that. So, it makes it impossible for me. So, it's a major struggle.</br></br>

UCI: Hey. You know, I'm so happy that, I mean, I feel for you that you struggle with stuff like talking to your parents on those tablets. But you being able to tell the program, that's the point, you know? That's why we're doing this program, so that you can share your story.
