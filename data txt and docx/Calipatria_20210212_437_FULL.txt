This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Calipatria.</br></br>As always, I’m sending to you and the PrisonPandemic project with good graces and my best of wishes through this letter. I’m 25 years of age and I’ve been incarcerated since I was 19 years old. I’m currently held at Calipatria State Prison serving an 11-year sentence.</br></br>You recently sent my cellmate a letter and you stated at the end of it “if you don’t have a story maybe you know someone who does”. So here I am. When I read your letter it blew my mind that anyone was actually concerned to how it is, how we're living in here, or how we're coping with everything.</br></br>No one ever cares to ask and your letter made me feel human again, so thank you for that. Since COVID-19 the prison system every single day has been a nightmare. It seems as if they come up with new things by the day, every single day it's a new program (most of the time its 24 hours stuck in the cell), no phone calls or yard.</br></br> We were stripped for our visits in March of 2020, they barely decided to let us get the chance to do virtual visits with our family and this was in December 2020. And that only lasted for only three weeks before it was shut down due to COVID breakouts on the yard. I haven’t seen, hugged, or had the blessing of being in the presence of my loved ones for a whole year now.</br></br>We are able to get a phone call every other day, that’s if they even run program in the building. We are able to go to yard every three days for two hours to workout, walk or run the track. No sports or have the chance to have someone cut our hair.</br></br>There is not any free staff workers maintenance and plumber. My toilet has been out of commission for a whole month now. It doesn’t flush so when we use the restroom after we are done we have to fill up a spastic storage container full of water and pour it into the toilet bowl to flush the feces or urine down. Usually after three or four pours it does the job, luckily we have our masks to block out the smell. We put in multiple work orders with the COs but as usual they could care less of how we live it’s like they get a kick out of seeing us go through it.</br></br>Not being able to be in the company of my family really put a strain on me. Being in the cell literally all day only goes way to think and stress so you really have to block out all the worry some and stressful thoughts because it will drive you mad. I’ve been keeping myself busy Monday-Friday by working out, reading, and writing to my family, it really helps me cope with what is really going on around me.</br></br>I’ve been doing lots of self-analyzing looking at my life and things I’ve been through and what I truly want for myself beyond these walls. Things was I once into at one point in time are no longer attractive to me anymore. It’s as if the lifestyle I gave my life to is beginning to recede. Over the years I’ve learned that I cannot alter external things nor shape people to my liking or mold the world to my wishes, but one thing for sure that I can alter is the internal things in my life, my desires, passions, and my thoughts, to look at my situation from another perception.</br></br>I believe that I am and all that I’ve been through is building to my character, I feel as a progressive and ever evolving being you are where are at in life so that you may learn and grow. After you endure the endurable you will be able and ready to take on difficult tasks and life lessons that the world has to offer.</br></br>Just prior to my celly receiving your letter I was pouring the water to flush the toilet and I told my celly “No one knows what we are going through in here nor do they care” and I was wrong so again thank you for your letter you all are good people. I appreciate you in the highest fashion and look forward to hearing back from you guys if possible.</br></br>With respect and best wishes.
