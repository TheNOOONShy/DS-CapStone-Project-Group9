Dear PrisonPandemic,</br></br>

My name is [redacted] and I am a inmate here at (RJD) Richard J. Donovan Correctional Facility in San Diego. On April 19, 2021, I received a letter from one of your UCI college students asking about the pandemic situation inside this facility. Although, I have concerned loving family and friends that I am constant in contact with in society, I gratefully welcomed her thoughtful letter wholeheartedly from the enrolled student.</br></br>

Since the awareness of the COVID-19 outbreak in our prison facility, the CDCR DAI had directed all prison institutions to implement a 14 day modified program on June 19, 2020, that was effective June 22, at 1600 hours. The “plan of operation notice,” that was distributed to all (3) E-yard buildings stating in part; Dayroom and yard schedule will be minimized in order to afford sufficient space for appropriate social distancing. Also, all movement will be controlled and limited to afford appropriate social distancing until further notice from the (DAI) Department of Adult Institution.</br></br>

As for the beginning question, “What has been happening inside facilities during the COVID-19 pandemic?” My story begins with my emotional seesaw experience of whether I am going to die or not, and disbelief of CDCR disregard for inmates human life. Although, CDCR/RJD state prison has slowly taken necessary precaution to deal with this pandemic situation, I elect to mention that CDCR/RJD had resulted to negligence in wrongfully spreading the virus and causing inmates death throughout various CDCR institutions in California.</br></br>

My claim stems from observation and provided knowledge from “internal sources,” that infected employees were still allowed to remain at work at first, and the transferring of infected inmates from one location to another location within the present facility and aboard was wrongfully in motion. The more infected population, the more “Coronavirus Aid Relief” that CDCR can request from the government to continue to stuff their pockets more.</br></br>

The next question “How have you felt about your safety inside?” Despite, the above ending paragraph about CDCR mischief conduct, I have seriously followed the health care service provider’s advice and instructions by continuing to wear my mask at all times, staying at least six feet from others, and washing my hands often to stop the continuing spread of the virus in my area or around the facility. Also, I constantly take advantage of the COVID-19 test every chance I am allowed to do so, I have taken (6) COVID-19 tests with negative results every time. Yet, I am skeptical about the vaccine, due to pass history stories and conflicting negative news information.</br></br>

However, as to your fifth question “How have the vaccinations been going at your facility?” The provided vaccines have been going rather smoothly for the once infected inmates, though for some, there have been side effects that have been discomfort experiences. But most inmates are happy, while the others are unfazed about reality.</br></br>

Moving on to the next question “What has it been like to have reduced visitations from family and love ones?” It’s been difficult, because I look forward to the weekends when I visit with family. However, I understand and realize the health and safety seriousness of family separation because of this pandemic situation.</br></br>

Yet I am grateful for the created video visiting system that CDCR has introduced to the CDC incarceration population. It’s my opinion, that the video visiting experience was a enjoyable opportunity to me, and everyone else with no complaints to mention at this time.</br></br>

Moving on to the next question again, “How have you been coping with this crisis?” My way of coping with the crisis was by staying mindful of my surroundings and the pandemic situation, praying for myself and others aboard, reading books, listen to music (Jazz particularly), exercising, writing letters, and repairing various things for needy inmates. Which I truly enjoy doing in my leisure time.</br></br>

Lastly, the question about “what has it been like to be inside during this time?” This question asked was actually the second question, but I chose to answer it last because my consequences resulted to imprisonment. I accept personal responsibility for my unlawful committed crimes. At the time I committed robbery crimes, I was a angry, resentful, selfish, impulsive, immature individual. However, because of addresses issues, and self development maturity growth, I am a changed person today who has experienced remorse, empathy and compassion for the first time since my October ‘98 incarceration.</br></br>

Although, I have a lengthy sentence that was appropriate, due to the crime and emotional trauma that I caused the various victims to experience on those crime dates and thereafter. I am truly sorry for my behavior of unlawfulness and truly wish that I was able to take those (p.t.s.d) memories away from a far. Yet, I realize that this is “wishful thinking,” I desperately continue to make direct, indirect and living amends by writing remorse letters, paying my restitution to the victims and being in service to others.</br></br>

Since the pandemic world outbreak, I had become afraid of the inevitable as I continue to watch various news stations reporting the news stories about the people who are infected and the nations death toll across our country. I had rapid racing thoughts that flooded my mind one after another that had scared me more and more to a emotional state at times. But then, I would remember my late mother’s soft voice saying son “whatever problem that is bothering you, turn to God because he is a hearer of prayers and a great comforter. No one will truly know what you are going through, but he will son.”</br></br>

Raising from my knees after praying, I no longer felt scared or worried about dying or leaving behind my three family siblings to deal with this unmerciful pandemic situation alone. The power of prayer is just that, powerful!! I realize, that I cannot change my circumstances, but I can change my subconscious thoughts that caused unpleasant and unhelpful feelings. Also, I realize that I have the will, the strength and the inner power to move my life forward by not worrying, and releasing my past wrongs, because “who I am, is no longer what I did and what I did is who I am.” Meaning a criminal who was callous.</br></br> 

However, I strongly believe that nothing is more important at this point then to have a personal spiritual communication with our creator. This is not an area to debate our belief or lack of belief in our creator; it’s where we gain trust and faith in knowing that he heard our prayers as we wait patiently for a response.</br></br>

I feel, that the only best way that I can help the world society and my inside prison community is by continuing to pray for people, and being a caring good listener for someone who need to talk. I value human life now, and the toll amount of people that we had lost because of this pandemic is troubling grasp as well as the constant killings of American citizens.</br></br>

Yet, I am very grateful for the created vaccine, the health workers and other Americans who are helping to stop the spread of the virus as well as the government assists aid.</br></br> 

With that, let me just say, I now realize, life was not meant to be all smiles and laughter on this planet called Earth. Life is full of teaching moments and opportunities to learn. Life without problems and challenges would create strengthless people I believe. If we didn’t have bad problems, then we couldn’t enjoy the good learning experiences.</br></br>

In closing, I hope this story was welcoming and good enough for the reader. Take care of yourself out there because the UCI college students needs the continuing traditional learning as you once did as you aged. Stay focus on your dreams and goals until completed entirely. May our creator bless you all and keep watch over ya’ll always.</br></br>

Sincerely,</br></br>
