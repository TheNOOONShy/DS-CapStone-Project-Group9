This letter was written by a person incarcerated at California City Correctional Facility.</br></br>


A big thing with inmates is contact with friends and loved ones so a good thing the state did was at that time, twice a week we were given free phone calls. Something that has never been available before. But that was a huge help, it’s custom for inmates to complain about what they don’t have but very few are thankful for the little we do receive and that was such a huge blessing for me.</br></br>


I don’t have many people in my life but the few I do have I love them with everything I am. So being able to speak to them and know that they were well and handling the lockdown as best as they could was a small relief. So at that time the only way you could contact family was phone calls when the C.O.s let you out of your cell.</br></br>


And mail, the mail was a joke. One letter I received it took the prison 13 days to give it to me and I understand everything is slow but I thought 13 days just to receive a letter was mind blowing. And like I had mentioned for someone that receives very little mail, it was a big thing the rest of the inmates that were housed there were dealing with the same thing.</br></br>


As for as time out of the cell we were allowed about 40 minutes to shower and interact with each other. And we would get that once a day. The days we would have yard it would be around 90 minutes and we would receive yard twice a week. The same thing is given at the prison that I’m currently in now.</br></br>


Since my arrest in November 2019, I have not been out of my cell for more than two hours a day. So we all spend most of our time in the cell. When I first arrived here there was no COVID-19 cases and for the inmates it was impossible to catch it because we can’t come and go like staff is able to do. So once someone comes into contact with someone that has COVID, they shut the prison down.</br></br>


So that small time that we were allowed out that was no longer given to us. There was one month that were not given a chance to make any phone calls or shower. We managed to keep ourselves clean by showering in our sink. We call it bird bathing. So for us that was very frustrating. “But hey it’s prison,” some would say.</br></br>


This past February is when the prison went around to hand out a survey to see what we thought about taking the vaccine once it was available to us. At that time I did not know enough to want to take it and then to learn we could not work or go to school without taking it. So when the time came to take it, I said yes and as of March 5th, I’m fully vaccinated. And we were given Moderna vaccine.</br></br>


There still is a small amount of inmates that have not taken the shot but it’s not due to them not wanting to take it, they have to wait their turn. I know the prison was offering visits online so for those that do receive visits they could see and talk to their family through webchat once a month for 30 minutes. And the next step for visiting would be if you wanted a physical visit you have to be vaccinated and your family must take a COVID test 72 hours before coming.
