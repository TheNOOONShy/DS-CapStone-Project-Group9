Hey PrisonPandemic!</br></br>

I hope when you get this letter, you’re in the best health. Well thank you for reaching out to me and seeing if I’m OK. It really means a lot.</br></br>

Well yes, I am OK. Like two months ago, I had COVID-19. But not anymore, thank God. Now I’m doing a lot better.</br></br>

But other than that, on my free time I like to watch TV, work out so I can be in good shape before I go home. Oh yeah, my release date is this year. I can’t wait till I go home. I have a lot of things I have to do.</br></br>

First, eat some bomb food. Second, spend time with my daughter; she’s five years young, she’s my pride and joy, my everything. I miss her and love her. Can’t wait to take her to Disneyland, the park, the movies, the beach, and much more. I’m gonna spoil the hell out of her, if you know what I mean.</br></br>

Third, go to work. And stay out of trouble and away from all the bull crap. You feel me. But anyways, you can say I’m doing fine. Just waiting to go to the free world. So yeah, once again, thank you for checking up on me.</br></br>

Well PrisonPandemic, it was nice hearing from you. Hope to hear from you again. You made a smile on my face when I got your letter. Well take care and God bless you and your family. I pray for you all.</br></br>

Sincerely,</br></br>

God bless you!</br></br>

Take care of yourself.
