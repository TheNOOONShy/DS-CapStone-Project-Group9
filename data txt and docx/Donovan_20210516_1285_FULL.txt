This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Donovan.</br></br>

Hello [redacted] and the rest of you at UCI.</br></br>

My name is [redacted] and I received your invitation to write and speak on the pandemic from a prisoner’s perspective. I’d be glad to share and help you all.</br></br>

When the COVID-19 pandemic just hit the prison system I was housed at Donovan State Prison in Hanford. Then I transferred to here at RJD in November. I can tell you Donovan took it a lot more serious than R.J.D. What I mean by that is if inmates tested positive for COVID-10 they were sent to a isolation building and kept there for 30 days.</br></br>

If we went on quarantine we were kept in our cells for 14 days period! No phone calls, we were celled, and only came out every 72 hours for a shower. They did have critical workers (porters) who were inmates who lived in the housing unit, and they cleaned all surface areas, shower railings, floors with cellblock disinfectant and bleach.</br></br> 

Our medications, food, canteen, laundry was all brought to our cells and given to us through the tray slot in the cell door. I can say from March to April of 2020 hardly anyone got sick in my housing unit. One officer, and maybe four inmates. At first, they only gave us cloth face mask to wear.</br></br> 

When it was time for me to transfer in November 2020 to R.J.D. I was placed on a 14 day quarantine and tested for COVID-19 which came back negative along with about 5 other inmates. We were all put on a van. Two people per van and once we got here at R.J.D. we went on 14 day quarantine again and was tested to see if we were positive for COVID-19. The transportation cops were even given temperature checks before they were allowed to drive into the prison.</br></br>

My test came back as negative and I was let off quarantine. The prison was on a semi-modified program. Cellfed, yard was only top tier for all five buildings while bottom tier for all five buildings got dayroom then switch morning afternoon vise versa, canteen, laundry brought to the building. No religious services only in cell, no visiting only phone calls.</br></br>

But that all changed when R.J.D. and CDCR started housing known positive COVID-19 inmates in my housing unit [redacted]! And it only took about 10 days for my building to become COVID-19 positive. All but four people.</br></br>

We all weathered through it for what I believe was 60 days of isolation. It is very unfortunate that three people died! R.J.D was a lot more reckless when it came to disinfecting common areas and enforcing face mask wearing. It is a fact that in a lawsuit that is against CDCR called Armstrong R.J.D. and any other CDCR prison wasn’t by a court order to house known COVID-19 positive inmates with those of us that have disabilities.</br></br>

My building is a mental health building which is recognized by the courts as a disability. Plus there is also those of us who have physical disabilities: asthma, HIV, other breathing problems, COPD and physical handicaps and most of [redacted] section the cells are set up for wheel chair housing.</br></br>

I myself only have asthma, but getting the COVID-19 I was lucky enough to only be asymptomatic. In fact I didn’t even know I had it until I was tested, and all this Armstrong court order and the housing of sick inmates with nonsick ones was all knowledge and insight I later found out.</br></br>

Was I scared? Well no, but I was upset that R.J.D. didn’t care enough to not have us all the way they did and have such a callous disregard for our lives! </br></br>

That made me more depressed and sad. That’s my mental problem, but not having visits didn’t bother me much. I haven’t had one the 25 years that I have been in prison. The last person on earth that cared about me my father passed away Feb 2019. So I’ve gotten used to no letters from home and he lived back east and couldn’t afford to come see me. It has been hard on those that do have loved ones.</br></br>

GTL the phone company has given those who have someone to call 2 free phone calls a month and the government allows prisoners to also collect the economic impact checks as we all have become $320,0.00 richer and in prison believe it or not that is a lot of money.</br></br>

There is also a economy in here. People buy canteen, packages, phone calls, books. Unfortunately people use the funds on negative aspects also. We all have our demons. I am so glad I’ve spent the last 10 years to conquer mine.</br></br>

I’m in the new drug treatment program here called the Matt program. It consists of treating opiate addictions with counseling and suboxone, and believe me it works. I had been abstinent from heroin for 10 years but still had cravings.</br></br>

The suboxone blocks the receptors to stop the cravings completely. The recovery part of the treatment is through the Phoenix House and it is good. I’ll be paroling in March of 2022 and it is a relief to not have a monkey on my back after 26 years of incarceration.</br></br>

So finally the system is not punishing us for addiction and treating us instead. So I spent my stimulus money on a pen pal ad on writeaprisoner.com. That ad will be up and running in a month or so if anyone be interested in helping me get used to interacting with the free world again.</br></br>

Now that is something I am scared about. I’m getting released right after a pandemic, the state will give me $300.00 to parole with and hopefully some kind of re-entry housing? I also spent the time working on my book of poems. It’s about the perspective of life through a prisoner’s eyes. Life, love, death, addiction, insanity, family, incarceration, hope……</br></br>

I’ve been through all of it and I lost a lot of myself along the way in order to come into being I am now. I’ve enclosed one of the poems that’s in my book. I hope you guys enjoy it and feel free to give me some feedback. The county is struggling right now but I see hope where some only see broken. Even in here racism is almost nonexistent.</br></br>

For a long time I never fit in because I’m not and it could have cost me my life years ago at places like Pelican Bay and I’ve been there. I’ve been lucky I suppose at times I feel I have a guardian angel because I’ve had some close calls in here like COVID-19. It was death for some and a minor irritant for others.</br></br>

So I’ve enclosed a picture of me with my long hair which I just cut and donated. Give you guys a face with my words. You can use my name with my words. I don’t mind. Heck I might get some fan mail to warm this ole lonely heart of mine! Be nice to have a friend.</br></br> 

Well take care. I do hope I did you all justice. I want to thank you from the deepest depth of my heart! It gives me hope, and loses my fear that people care out there, really care. Thanks.</br></br>

Respectfully</br></br>

“Blood on the Badge”</br></br>

There is someone struggling trying to break free,</br></br>
And that someone is just like you and me.</br></br>

Though in gender and race we may not be the same.</br></br>
More likely than not we don’t even share the same city or name.</br></br>

Yet strangled we are by the same corruptive grip!</br></br>
Can you feel it tighten as your life begins to slip?</br></br>

For there’s blood on the badge with time to kill!</br></br>
So hungry is this beast that needs its fill.</br></br>

No place is safe there’s no place to run!</br></br>
For long is the barrel of a lawman's gun.</br></br>

The target is sighted on the poorest side of town.</br></br>
The target is sighted and taken down!</br></br>

Covered up with a lie is the oath to protect and serve.</br></br>
And the cries of the poor go on always unheard.</br></br>

A lifeless corpse chalked out upon the cities’ streets!</br></br>
Just another dead suspect lying at the cop’s feet.</br></br>

The clock is ticking and we’re out of time.</br></br>
For there is murder on the streets with no peace of mind.</br></br>

A life taken with just the turn of the page.</br></br>
For the chapters of internal affairs are tinged with pain and range!</br></br>

Little pink houses for you and me?</br></br>
Not likely in the land of penitentiary!</br></br>

Equal justice for one and all?</br></br>
“Mass incarceration so let the bodies fall.”</br></br>

Dark and silhouetted is the figure.</br></br>
For the mans in the shadows with a finger on the trigger!</br></br>

There’s someone struggling and trying to breathe!</br></br>
And that someone is just like you and me.</br></br>
