This story was told by a person incarcerated at Chuckawalla.</br></br>

Caller: Man, it’s - it's, let's say, everything that makes common sense to the pandemic situation of social distancing. It’s totally backwards. Because you got other inmates and you got each inmate is not social distancing. Each bunk is right next to the next bunk, and I have a bunkie, and we’re in a cube, probably about 30'x10' feet.</br></br> 

And you got 10 people all in one little cube, and nobody’s wearing masks there. And, you know, everybody is sitting with each other. So it’s like, you know, where’s the social distancing?</br></br>

And there’s no, like, even though we do social distancing in a dayroom and stuff like that, you still gotta go back to your bunk and live with someone that lives right underneath you or above you and the next person, or you know, all together you got about four people living all the way around you plus your bunkie. So that makes five. So there’s no social distancing whatsoever here in this, in this prison. At all.</br></br>

UCI: How has the vaccination situation been like at your facility?</br></br>

Caller: Huh?</br></br>

UCI: How has the vaccination situation been like?</br></br>

Caller: The medical has been, as far as I know, they've been doing as much as they possibly can, know what I mean? They, they’ve been offering us medical treatment, checking our temperatures and stuff like that. But it’s like, you know, and then when one person gets, you know, a positive test reading, they lock us down, and it cuts us off from everything. The whole building goes on quarantine, and that person gets taken out.</br></br>

It just doesn’t make sense, you know? They take one person from one building to a whole other building that has other other buildings going into that same one. And so it’s like, it’s just spreading everywhere. Like, they make it worse.
