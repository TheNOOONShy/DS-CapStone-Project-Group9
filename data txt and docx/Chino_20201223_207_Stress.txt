This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Chino.</br></br>

I am not worried about myself because I worked for the frontline from day one and never got ill. So when I showed no symptoms after being infected, I doubted I would get ill. But I have seen the faces and the fatal results that some endured and the sight was not pretty.</br></br> 

I soon learned that the guys who were not eating or seemed to sleep 24 hours a day were being hit the hardest. I did what I could for the prisoners in isolation, such as passing messages, giving them toiletries, providing them with coffee and even picking up their outgoing mail to family and friends that some officers would not do.</br></br> 

I exposed myself daily, but I felt that if I were in their shoes, I would have hoped someone would do that for me. This was aside of myself I had not experienced before like this. I have missed Christian fellowship during the crisis and those who used to come into prison to share in the prison ministries we have heard nothing of.</br></br> 

Our hearts go out to them, their families, and all those directly effected by this virus.
