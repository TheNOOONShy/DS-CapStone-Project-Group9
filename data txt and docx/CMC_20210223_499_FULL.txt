Coping with COVID-19</br></br>

The news came with pictures of people dying and concerns of mass infections. At the start of it all I felt no direct impact as I continued to work daily and knew no one who became infected. I then started to take notice on how the virus was spreading through CDCR.</br></br>

The first wake up call for me came when I was informed that all PIA workers have been cancelled, leaving me without work. This lasted for months and as the virus spread through CMC the daily program became more restrictive. During this time, my sister also contracted COVID-19, and coupled with not working my anxieties started to peak at high levels.</br></br>

This is when I had to incorporate the different coping strategies I have formed over the years. Which include reading, writing, positive self talk, exercise, crocheting, music, and deep belly breathing. These strategies allowed me to not only steady my mind (which was all over the place), but also test them again as a proven means to relieve stress, make better decisions, and regulate my body functions.</br></br>

At the start of quarantine I began to take things personally over the many restrictions imposed including total lockdown. While incorporating my coping skills I started to view things from another perspective, one that didn't include what I wanted but what was best for my community.</br></br>

This led to a better understanding that what was being done was to protect and save lives in the best way known. Viewing things collectively I now see that the task of inmate and staff safety is a difficult one. This came clear when after the fifth COVID-19 test and all the restrictions I became positive for the virus.</br></br>

The first thing that came to me was panic as I was told I was being moved to a part of the prison where infected people were housed. The coping skills that I've been utilizing over the past few months helped me to focus my mind away from the panic, and on positive ways to maintain physical and mental health while fighting off the virus.</br></br>

The use of my coping strategies, and knowing that they work, has allowed me to form additional courage and strength when facing continued anxieties and stressors during this pandemic. Although some days are better than others, continuously using my positive coping skills ensures that I do not become complacent, and start to resort to any of my old negative ways of coping to dilute anxieties, pains, shame, depression, or any stressors that will come now in life and in the future.</br></br>

Hello out there!</br></br>

Here is a paper I wrote back in October dealing with COVID. The total cost of COVID hit the prison population hard. As of date four out of five prisoners here at CMC, yes, over 80 percent infection. With no visits or continued daily programming it really affects the mental thinking of a man as the walls and one's mind starts to close in. Some have support, but most don't.</br></br>

Staying healthy to stay alive has never had the direct meaning that it has today.</br></br>

Stay safe. Respectfully.
