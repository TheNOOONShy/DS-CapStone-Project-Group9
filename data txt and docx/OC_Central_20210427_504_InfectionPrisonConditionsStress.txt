This story was told by a person incarcerated at OC Central.</br></br>

Caller: Well, we just started by getting the visiting which is a positive thing due to COVID. And the six foot distance being a big factor, visits were, had to be contained at a minimum level and at some point stopped. But now they've continued.</br></br>

That was a lot of the extracurricular programs that the jails have as well. But we be, we be supplied with masks. Free masks, you know, in maintaining the six foot distance on our appointments in our community through the jails.</br></br>

UCI: How has the, sorry?</br></br>

Caller: It’s something different, you know?</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, definitely.</br></br>

Caller: Not everything is clear up. They got the vaccines going. I got the Johnson Johnson, so I think the vaccines are like a cure for the COVID as well as other problems that we might have.</br></br>

UCI: Mhmm.</br></br>

Caller: For sure that because you know, I'm still maybe want to request another see if I finished with my full process of the vaccine.</br></br>

UCI: Mhmm, have a lot of people at your facility been getting vaccinated?</br></br>

Caller: Truthfully, for the most part, I don’t, I haven't been paying attention but I'm sure they have. Yes, and service staff as well as well as inmates but, then again to the distance and the quarantine process that we go through. We don't really meet this, high security on coming in close to each other and making sure that we tested temperatures and checking on us and all that stuff.</br></br>

But a lot of things I was taking away from this as well due to COVID, that we need to reestablish and bring back in. As far as like I said, the visiting, movement, etc etc things that that would also help us while we here facing these mental challenges and, go for going through our cases and whatnot, you know?</br></br>

UCI: Mhmm, how have you been coping with the crisis?</br></br>

Caller: Well I pray on it you know I put a lot of prayer in it, and I wash my hands a lot and I watch my distances with people. I write a lot of letters. I was gonna say if you will be able to supply or send any supplies that, that will be helpful for like you know, coping with as far as writing letters and coloring.
