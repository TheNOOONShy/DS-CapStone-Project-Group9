This letter was written by someone at California City.</br></br>


They started to open up classrooms, limited seats and jobs but there’s a long waiting list and the youth offenders have priority first, so I’m still waiting for programs and a job, so things have been much more difficult. All the time I spent in county jail has made my time longer; if I would have been transferred to CDC a lot sooner, my 88% would have dropped to 80%.</br></br> 


And also, since there haven't been any jobs or programs to get milestones or my G.E.D. or vocational training, it feels like time is standing still and we’re not making any progress. I was able to complete the Matrix program, Moral Reconation therapy, Aggression Replacement training and Computer Keyboarding #1, and I was about to take my G.E.D. test in county jail right before the pandemic started.</br></br> 


I’ve been waiting since, hoping to pick up and continue with my G.E.D. and other self help programs and vocational training, not just to get milestones but to educate myself to better myself and my chances of being able to reenter society and have a better chance to succeed. And, it would also help for our days to go by much faster by staying busy and having something to look forward to every day like classes during the week and self help group meetings on the weekend and church services.</br></br> 


It would make our time much more easier and productive instead of being locked in our cells 23 hours a day. It’s like we’re being kept in storage when we should be getting rehabilitation. It’s like we are in segregated housing units where they put inmates when they get in trouble and they take away all your privileges. We just sit in our cells all day.</br></br>


I don’t think it’s good for us psychologically; maybe, if we at least had tablets during a time like this. While social distancing is an issue, tablets would help so we could watch educational videos, do N.A., anger management and other educational programs and stay in touch with family by video visits at a time like this, while we are worried about our families out there as they are about us because of the pandemic.</br></br>


They have already offered the vaccine and vaccinated all inmates that volunteered to get vaccinated. I refused the vaccine because I was already infected and recovered. I’d rather wait and see what the trials end up like and the side effects, but I would hope that with most of the inmates being vaccinated already that, hopefully soon, we will resume to normal programming.
