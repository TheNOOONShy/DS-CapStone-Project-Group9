Hello to you PrisonPandemic and students,</br></br> 

I am from Mule Creek Prison. At this prison our health and safety is of no real concern, prisoners come and go with COVID-19, or without it. It’s been hell in this prison this last year. The staff and CO five that run this place lock us down and call it quarantine.</br></br>

Then run program again when they don't want to do the work anymore. Then they move us around we get sick. Lock us down. It’s been going on like this for too long. No one cares about people in prison we can really see that now.</br></br>

So that my story in short. Prison is hell, COVID-19 made it hell times 10.
