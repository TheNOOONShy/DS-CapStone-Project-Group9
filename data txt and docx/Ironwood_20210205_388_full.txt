To whom it may concern,</br></br>

I donâ€™t understand how the state of California has a shortage of vaccine. But, yet Ironwood State Prison (CDCR) are vaccinating inmates as of today, who are not 65 years of age or older.</br></br> 

I am completely lost for words.</br></br> 

The law abiding, tax-paying citizen, veterans, and high-risk medical individuals can not get the vaccine, but yet they have vaccine for criminals.</br></br 

Please shed some light on this topic.</br></br> 

Thank you.
