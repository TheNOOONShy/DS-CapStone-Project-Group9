This story was told by a person incarcerated at John Latorraca Correctional Center.</br></br>

Caller: Okay. Well, they - it - for the past two years, right – because I've been here - I've been here, in this jail, for five. And, for the past two years, we've had - we've had no visits during the COVID. They cut our visits. Right?</br></br>

They even - they stopped allowing attorney visits. Like people got to have – the attorney's got to have their COVID shot even to see their attorney. And so, if your attorney doesn't have a COVID shot, they've been denying our lawyers to come see us, too.</br></br>

And a lot of these lawyers – you know what I'm saying – are hard to get ahold of on the phone and everything else. So it's - it's been really hectic with our legal representation because of the COVID. And this - this facility, too, has been having a lot of other problems. Like I said before, the plumbing went out for four days.</br></br>

And so they had to bring Porta Potties on the yard. And there was only four Porta Potties for 300 inmates to share. And you only got to go out once a day and use them.</br></br>

And there was no showers, no clean drinking water. And this is in the midst, when everybody's getting COVID. And they're not doing that good of a job, either, of quarantine inmates. You know what I'm saying?</br></br> 

Like that's - that's - that's like real hit and miss. People are coming through to - to population that still have COVID. And they're - they're infecting us. And a lot of that, too, is coming from the guards.</br></br>

Because I personally ask multiple guards, and they're anti-vaccine. So they don't got the vaccine. And most of them don't wear their masks when they come in here, either. And my - my fiancée's in Chowchilla Prison. Right?</br></br>

And she told me – she wrote me, in a letter, said the same thing that's going there – that like a lot of females in her building got infected because the - the officers brought it in. Because they're not wearing masks. They're not getting shots. And so the officers are bringing it in a lot of times.</br></br>

UCI: I understand. And have you witnessed any vaccination processes going on at your facility?</br></br>

Caller: Yes. I got the - I got the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. It - it made me sick, sick, sick. Like you know what I'm saying? For 24 hours, it felt like the worst opiate withdrawal imaginable. But I'm - I'm glad I got the vaccine.</br></br>

You know what I'm saying? I try to push all the other inmates that are in here to get it. You know what I'm saying? But they're real hit and miss. They're spotty with that.</br></br>

Because the County Health Department doesn't always have the vaccines on staff here. So - so like I was putting in medical requests for like six months before I finally got the vaccine. And then, they finally gave it to me. And then, they're just sporadically.</br></br>

Like they'll come by like once every month or two now and do it. But and they're behind on their booster shots, too. So there's a lot of inmates that got the first shot but haven't got their second shot. So, yeah, it's - it's not going too - too great on that.
