This story was told by a person incarcerated in OC_Lacy
<br><br>
Caller: Well I've been here since February 10th last year, so I was here before this whole thing even started, probably about a couple weeks before it all started. It's been an absolute journey during our lockdown situation; we were not given  proper masks; I mean at first we were not even given any. They just gave us pieces of sheet to wrap around our face.  We even asked for proper masks in the beginning, and asked everyone “why do the workers have masks but we don't?” A few months did go by and they ended up giving us masks. It just took a while. 
<br><br>
They were also housing other inmates in the same sector that we're at that had COVID-19 and we weren't even being told that these people were positive so some of us would go around and ask “why aren't you getting out of here” and they would respond “well that's because we're in quarantine we just got tested positive.” So anyways we are being housed right next to each other and that went on for quite a while. Once things started changing gear they started changing but it took a while. Right now they've given us hand sanitizer and they're moving the guys out that were infected.
<br><br>
But I have no idea where they are housing them at now… new guys that are being brought in are put into quarantine right away. I would say it took them about eight months from them to start checking us with the swabs and giving us COVID tests. But throughout those eight months they never even offered me the test, and I'm 61 years old and I'm in a medical dorm. Where I'm at now though is that I just got my shot in February, both of the two shots. So I would say that things are being handled here a little different now. 
<br><br>
 As far as hot meals that we are not getting hot meals , we haven't had hot meals in about 6 months now. It's pretty much just giving us bologna sandwiches for lunch everyday and it's not good quality at all. It's really and bad our biggest concern right now is dealing with the hot meals. They're not giving it to us and they're claiming that it's the virus because they told us that inmates were sick in the kitchen and that's why they closed it but I mean we made changes now and we're in the orange so why haven't we gotten any of our hot meals? 
<br><br>
Other than that it's just been an experience. They stopped all of our visits, we haven't had visits at all but they just recently opened them up. They now allow one visit per month, but I think this month they are allowing two however. So I did get a visit from my son and I haven't seen him in a long while… a whole year actually since I've seen him.  So now we're down to two visits as I've been told but that's kind of the thing that's not fair because we're finding out through our families that are calling here not to the guards.
<br><br>
We also find out information from the news not from the people working here. If we were to read the newspaper anything having to do with jail is usually cut out before we get it. So we'll get the newspaper and there will be a section cut out because it had to do with jail so it hasn't been easy. I'm in state prison myself and I haven't been infected but I fear because of my age and my health. I had a recent stage 3 kidney failure and like I said earlier, I'm 61. I'm worried about this virus. I know a few people who died in prison and died in jail. I just don't even know what's next. 
<br><br>
You know this virus is going to be around for a long time out there and I'm really concerned, we're all concerned in here. Everyday we spend here worrying I mean they're coming around now with tests and vaccines but at first when this whole thing started in February/March last year it was not like that at all. Like I said the deputies and workers all had masks but they did not give that to us then several would walk around without wearing masks. So we all thought you know, that they're the ones bringing it in here.
<br><br>
There also have been many from the outside that come in without wearing masks so you know we were all afraid and I think we still are. I don't think I speak just for myself here you know I think I speak for everyone in here. If I find out any information I'll be more than happy to speak up because you know I really don't know if I'll make it back out like I said I got the shot but they're still saying I can catch it but they said at the I won't die that the effects won't be as bad but I mean I don't know if that's true. I mean people have died from the vaccine to look at what's happened recently with Johnson & Johnson, so what do I know? So that's what's been going on over the past year.
<br><br>
UCI:  So how have you been coping with the crisis?
 <br><br>
Caller: not good myself personally I give it all up to God and I pray everyday. Really I just tried to stay positive. I don't know what's going to happen, I just try not to stay negative mentally. I worry all day long every single day that I'm in here from the time I wake up in my bed and I'm worried. I mean I'm in a four-man cell there's other inmates in here with me 2 man cells you know. There're two men cells and there're four men cells and I'm in a four-man. So we're there more and you know now we're allowed to go out but we weren't allowed before and that's another thing you know. In quarantine we weren't even allowed out to take a shower. Every two or three days we were supposed to be let out to go shower and do all that. I went longer than that multiple times I mean after my 14-day quarantine was up I still didn't even get let out. 
 <br><br>
It took me 21 days for them to let me out. So I asked “it's been 14 days and I have my shots why can't I be let out” and I always ask them “you know you're not letting me out I'm not getting my shower every night.” That's another thing too I mean guys coming in all the time that are sick and we just don't know about it. That was our main complaint. 
 <br><br>
They use the shower and can infect it; it's not being sanitized at all anyways. So that went on for quite a while too. I know most of the guys in here have been here for quite some time before the pandemic but if they bring in someone new we don't know where they're coming from, we don't know if they've been infected. If they come out and use our shower it could be infected because it's not like anyone's cleaning it... so as far as things have gone in my mind mentally… it's  just not good like I said I'm just afraid every day I wake up.
 <br><br>
UCI: What do you think could have made the situation at your facility better ?
 <br><br>
Caller: From the beginning if they would have passed out masks right away if they just would have handled it and been more organized and more professional. You know,  not put inmates next to inmates that are sick, and give us proper masks that were needed. Also gave us hand sanitizer and let us clean our areas and the showers. No one gave us what we needed. Not just that, but completely ignore us you know, like I said we didn't get our masks until June. Okay I have to get off the phone here it looks like my time is up.
