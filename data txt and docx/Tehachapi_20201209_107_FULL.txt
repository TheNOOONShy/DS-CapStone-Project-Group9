This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Tehachapi.</br></br>
                                                                                                                                                               Hello “UCI Student”</br></br>PrisonPandemic Project sounds great, and I would love to share some stories for the archive, for historical purposes with the goal they could lead to positive reforms. My grammar and sentence structure is not “college standard”, so bear with me. Maybe you could edit this for me if I make it on the website.</br></br> 
Well, I guess I should start at the beginning, when it all started. I was actually at a different prison, to be exact. I was getting ready to be transferred to Tehachapi, and then all hell broke loose. The same day I was supposed to get on a bus, and come down here, was the same day California had shut down. So yeah, I felt the effects of COVID-19 immediately. With the shelter in place in effect, the prison wasn’t doing any transfers, so I was held up for another 2 months.</br></br> 
During that time, I was holed up in my cell watching a lot of Stargate SG1, that’s how I was coping with all this. It’s actually a great show and Amanda Tapping is beautiful, but that’s another story for another day. I just wanna highly recommend that show as must watch TV show. Even though it came out 24 years ago, it’s all good, call it a classic.</br></br>
So I'm stuck for a while, the world is shot down. Did I feel safe? Yeah, I felt pretty safe being locked inside of a prison during a worldwide pandemic. I was actually more worried for the people out there on the streets. I kinda felt like I was in my own personal fallout shelter or bunker. Or “Panic Room,” like the movie with Helen Hunt & Forest Whitaker. Yup, the perfect hiding place. Or was that Jody Foster? They actually look alike, I can’t confirm who that was at the moment, I’ll just go with Helen Hunt.</br></br> 
In 2020, they finally put me on a bus headed to Tehachapi. That was a real strange experience. Because due to COVID-19 restrictions, I got to ride on a big prison bus that usually carries like 50 inmates. But instead of 50, it was only three of us on the hour bus ride down here. During the ride, I got to look at the new world we live in. It really wasn’t much to see, everybody was inside, sheltering in place. When I got here, I had to deal with all the changes due to coronavirus. A lot of limited movement and things of that nature. Nothing that’s really noteworthy. Well, last month I actually tested positive for COVID-19, so I was put in isolation for two weeks. I never had any symptoms and I didn’t feel sick at all. And all that because I have a bad tooth that needs to be removed. I went to the dentist trying to get my tooth fixed, but you have to take a COVID test before dental will do any work. And that’s how I ended up in isolation for two weeks. Very frustrating because my tooth is still messed up.</br></br> 
Being inside a prison during the age of COVID has been like nothing I ever experienced before. I really can’t compare it to anything. The phone company that provides service for the prison has been giving us free phone calls on certain days, so that’s cool. And recently, me and bunch of other inmates got three months knocked off our sentence for good behavior during these rough times. It felt good to get the time reduction, but at the same time I felt bad because of the circumstances of everything. Like thousands of people had to die from a virus in order for me to get the three months knocked off my sentence. I didn’t really do anything to earn it. I just wish it came under different circumstances, that's all.</br></br> 
Most of my days are spent inside of my cell reading books, and doing GED homework that gets sent to my cell. I don’t have a radio or TV at the moment, so I don’t know what's going on out there in the world. Sometimes, I get extremely bored. The books help with that. I can’t physically go to the library because of COVID restrictions, so I use the half-decent book system they have, that consist of a bunch of authors and book titles and bar codes. I say it’s half-decent because it takes a week to receive your book. And then when your done it’s not like you could return it yourself, you have to wait for library people to come get it. And then you could only get one book. I'm done with that book in two days. So yeah I said half-decent but that might be too much praise.</br></br> 
As I write this letter, a nurse just came by doing temperature checks. It seems like the building I live in is going on a quarantine again. Some inmates are testing positive, so they're gonna be moving to the isolation building. Everyday something new up here, you never know what's gonna happen next. </br></br>
Don’t worry, my letter doesn’t have coronavirus, I feel fine, but I'm sure your taking precautions as you should.</br></br> 
Way back in February, when the news was starting to talk about the coronavirus sometime, I had a radio that I listened to a lot. The news was talking about the virus, and nobody was really taken it seriously. I remember leaving a building where they do groups at. I was writing in a crowded hallway full of inmates, no masks, no social distancing, but it was only February. Nobody cared. So, this inmate I know walks up to me with his handout to say what's up and greet me, instead of shaking his hand, I balled up my fist and gave him some “dap” or “first bump” and I said “hey man, corona”. He kinda looked a lil' crazy. I guess I was little paranoid because I was listening to the news a lot. Now looking back at that moment, I had in retro-spect, I guess I was just prepared. I never knew it would come to this though.</br></br>
It’s great that UC Irvine is giving inmates a pandemic voice, and an outlet to speak with the PrisonPandemic Project. I think it’s important to get a view of the pandemic, from a prisoner’s perspective. And it’s a good way to document history.</br></br>
I actually never attended college, but I have been on a few campuses up north. And it’s always cool, I love colleges and the culture that surrounds it. So that’s why I was excited to get your letter and eager to write back. Thanks for reaching out. You came to the right place. If you need any more stories or anything else, you can write to me anytime you want.</br></br> 
Best wishes.
