I got to say it's been nothing but hell with trying to adjust to this type of environment, not to mention with this pandemic.</br></br> 

I mean it's kind of hard to speak up on certain issues because it gets blown out of proposition at times depending on the situation and location. And with this virus it's been a mess! It's impossible to avoid contact with other inmates especially when you always have a bunkie, and the masks don't make a difference at all because these facilities were not designed to undergo these kind of conditions.</br></br> 

In all honesty, we are face to face everywhere we go, from the bunks to the restroom to the shower and during our meals in the chow hall with the exception of the day room and yard. And it's not fair because it all just gets swept under the rug and covered up. Not to mention the discrimination and misconduct of some staff. It's not fair when are very lives including that of families are at risk!</br></br>

What would be a short term sentences could prove fatal.
