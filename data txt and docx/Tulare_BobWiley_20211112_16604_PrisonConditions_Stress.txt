This story was told by a person incarcerated at Tulare Bob Wiley Detention Center.</br></br>

UCI: Okay awesome. You were telling me about what the COVID situation was like at your facility.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, so there was a breakout in the unit and then – it just seemed like they didn't know what to do, you know? So people kept getting sick in our unit. The numbers kept jumping and then finally they moved the people that tested positive to another unit after a bunch of people caught it. And it's just - it's been hard.</br></br>

Like there's no programs, you know. We only get out like 30, 15 to 30 minutes a day out of our cells. I haven't seen no church volunteers since all this started. It's just hard.</br></br>  

There's hardly any books. No resource - we have no resources. Like - and it's been hard. Like, I’ve been - I’m slipping into like a depression; just trying to get myself to get up everyday, you know?</br></br>

UCI: Yeah definitely. How have you been coping with this?</br></br> 

Caller: I’m just like trying to - I think my times up. They only give me 15 minutes.
