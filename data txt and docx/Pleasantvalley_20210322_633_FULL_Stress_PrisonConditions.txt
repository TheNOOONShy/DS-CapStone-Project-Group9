This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Pleasant Valley.</br></br>

Thank you so much for the card and the message. Something so small means a lot of value in here. I been going through some troubles and tribulations at the moment due to the fact I just got into a fight on 3/15/21. I'm so scared right now, I might be permanently blinded.</br></br> 

My eye vision is not OK. I got sprayed in my eyes. My vision right now is blurry.</br></br> 

I’m so sad and depressed a the system right now cause all of this could’ve been prevented.</br></br>

Long story short I’m enrolled in drug class, this other inmate has been very disrespectful towards female staff teachers. Not to mention he physically beat up a handicap person in our class. All this falls under me personally advising the manager of the classes that this inmate being disruptive in our class has been on too many altercations for them to be in our class.</br></br> 

They don’t do nothing in regards of the matter.</br></br>

So now I just got into this fight and sprayed when all things could have been prevented. So now I'm here scared for my life that my eye vision comes back. So sad that now I get more time away from my family when all of this could've been prevented.</br></br> 

I’m no angel but what’s right is right and what’s wrong is wrong.</br></br> 

In this story that just took place is totally wrong. To top it off, guess who is still in our class?</br></br>

That’s a little taste on the bullshit that happens in prison and how the system doesn’t give a fuck. So sad, sad to get more time for a fight that could've been prevented as told. Not to mention I might be permanently blinded for this bullshit. I'm so sad because my baby sister needs me more than anything in the world right now.</br></br>

Sincerely.
