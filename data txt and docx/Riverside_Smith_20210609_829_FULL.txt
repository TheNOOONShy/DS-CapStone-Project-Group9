<em>This story was told by a person incarcerated at Larry D. Smith Correctional Facility.</br></br></em>

UCI: What has the COVID situation been like at your facility?</br></br>

Caller: Well, it's a situation where I was in a place in a housing unit and I didn't really approve of the situation because, you know, there was a situation where somebody [assured] and [unintelligible] situation of COVID of – what do you call that – of politicking. It's like gang rivals, you know. It's a bad situation. And I couldn't move cells and stuff like that.</br></br>

And then, I was, like, one of the first ones to get the vaccination and I couldn't go to court because the systems was down and they was delayed. So, they did not call up for court, and when their systems went down, their lights shut out here and they had a power outage and, you know, can't get to a lot of people.</br></br>

And during some politicking rooms, rumors and about this, about that, you know. They labeled too many people as COVID defendants without the vaccination so fights broke out and stuff like that. It's just bad. It's a scary situation all together, you know.</br></br> 

I'm still looking to get rehoused to a better, you know, housing unit where I can be in a program or something like that. I'm trying to get into – during that time I registered to vote. They never got back to me. I did autographing designs, I did my GED. I never got my score back for GED.</br></br> 

Never got my test scores back and everything like that because of the COVID stuff. So, I really wanted to sue. I called a lawyer, I tried calling an attorney to sue, a paralegal. That didn't work out.</br></br>

So, and I'm still waiting on my next court date. They told me a court date but I'm not sure what went on, why the systems went down. You know, I could have been sped up in a way or, you know. I just don't know. I just don't feel too much faith.</br></br> 

My mom got sick from COVID and she got sick and couldn't really, you know, help her. She couldn't really help me out, put money on my books or nothing like that. My brother, he had fallen off a ladder at work and, you know, so he broke his back and a couple of discs and is fine and everything.</br></br>

UCI: Oh, no.</br></br>

Caller: So, even my brother [unintelligible] to my immediate family. And, you know, just about food situation. So, I told mental health here that I needed to be in a more singular room, you know, and they didn't put me in one.</br></br>

And said that just I was hearing too many voices, and I was hearing voices, and they didn't administer my meds right. It's just been horrible about this COVID-19, that's all I want to say.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, no, yeah. I'm sorry to hear that. Sounds like it's been pretty rough.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah.</br></br>

UCI: And how - what has the COVID situation been like at your facility, you know, regarding, like, your programming and visitation?</br></br>

Caller: Well, it's been just picking it up. You know, just talked to my mom. You know, she's old and she's real old and, you know, when she gets sick I just can't seem to get ahold of her anytime if I don't [unintelligible] call. Because, like, you know – and lucky, alright, now I have money on my books, you know, because my brother's girlfriend put money on my books.</br></br> 

Finally, you know, I asked somebody here, you know, if I could, like, ease in, you know, they could call my family for me, somebody that had, you know, money and more fortunate that I am to call my family and get ahold of my family. And the behavioral health, they check in on me here, but the room I'm in they don't check on you. But, they checking on A, B, and C.</br></br>

But things, like I said, things are picking up. So, at least I got a letter just now. I just got a letter just now saying you guys are a team and, wow, they wanted to hear the experience. So, it's been sort of scary, you know, and rough for, man, I don't even –</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, I mean, it sounds pretty scary.</br></br>

Caller: You know, in the Bible, you know, it's just we're in the end of days, you know. Revelations says, you know, [unintelligible] – it's too much to expect, to not expect the worst, you know. So, you know, it's just certain things to be wary of, you know. My heart tells me there's certain things. You know, don't hang around trouble. And, you know, trouble looks for you, you know.</br></br>

UCI: That's true. Sometimes that is true. I can attain to that, I heard that. And how has the vaccination situation been like at your facility?</br></br>

Caller:  Well, the vaccination didn't come until, you know – I really just had testing. [Unintelligible] emergency shutdown, you know. It's just testing, test, and test. They test, they test, they test. But, you know, the vaccine didn't come until, like, months and months either, you know. And I've been in here for seven months, you know.</br></br>
 
I've been waiting to go to court, you know. Last [unintelligible] I've been put on a hold from court because I was speaking out in court, you know, or something like that and they want to send me to Patton State. And so, I was waiting on a bit for Patton State, you know, wondering when am I, you know – they keep testing, they testing, but I didn't test positive for COVID the whole time.</br></br>

I'm put in the room, you know, and they're just now coming around with vaccinations. This is in, like, December. From December, you know. I've been waiting for this, for Patton, and everything like that and [unintelligible]. Right now they're telling me, well, [unintelligible] to not call the Patton State and then we can still give you a [unintelligible] for your troubles and all that, you know.</br></br> 

Maybe you can catch a [unintelligible] again, you know, if you behave. You know, so, I'm just behaving, doing my best, you know, taking my meds. I haven't been [unintelligible] or nothing for, like, trying to [unintelligible] or nothing or something. But, the vaccination came and I was, like, one of the first in my tank. Me and 10 other to try out the vaccination, you know, when it first came.</br></br>

And when I tried it out, you know, I been sitting in the tank, I'm hearing voice stuff and I get put on timeout and they put me in another tank where it wasn't vaccinated. Not even vaccinated yet, you know what I mean. But, they still, you know, ruffed me about, you know, well you don't have no choice where you stay and stuff like that.</br></br> 

But, you know, that's not safe. People not wearing masks and stuff like that, and people were coming with hives and, you know, stuff like that. It's a great deal, you know, just blowing up and just, you know, [unintelligible].</br></br>

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: You know, just start [unintelligible]. Yeah, you know, and then they want this brutality, you know, just take you down on anything, you know, in here. So, I read in their printed agreement telling, you know, my [unintelligible], you know, from court, you know, and do my case but the systems were down. So, I'm praying now that their systems are up and running, right, you know.

UCI: Yeah.</br></br> 

Caller: And hopefully by July I can hear something about my [unintelligible], you know, because I'm supposed to get a [unintelligible] conference done for me.</br></br> 

And then, I'm trying to get into a program because I'm about to out of the GED program right now. And from [crosstalk] for that even to happen. So, it's the chaplain keeps check on, you know, sending stuff in through [unintelligible], you know, that got me through.</br></br>

UCI: That's good, that's good. So, you've used it as a coping mechanism.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah.</br></br>

UCI: Good, and that's what I was going to ask you as well. How have you been coping with the crisis?</br></br>

Caller: With the what?</br></br>

UCI: How have you been coping with the crisis?</br></br>

Caller: Oh, the Isis?</br></br>

UCI: Crisis, as in, like, with the situation.</br></br>

Caller: Oh, crisis. Oh, the situation?</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, the pandemic.</br></br>

Caller: Praying. Praying and going to Bible sessions. Going to every Bible study I can and [unintelligible].</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, that's really good. I mean, there's definitely – how's your programming? Like, you said that they reduced visitations?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, reduced visitations. I couldn't get visits. I'm pretty sure my parents would visit, but what I'm waiting, you know, I don't think I get – I don't know, I just try to visit, you know, and just there's too much going with COVID right now. They always told me COVID, it's the COVID going. So, you just have to keep on testing and wait for visits and stuff like that. And I was like, wow, you know, bullshit.</br></br>

UCI: Right. And how has this affected your loved ones? How's the COVID-19 situation affected them?</br></br>

Caller: It affected me big time, you know. It's like I can't get nothing done. I get no numbers. You know, my ex, you know, I couldn't – I just didn't get nothing, no one. And my love life, it just put me in the slums.</br></br>

UCI: Wow, I'm sorry to hear that.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, yeah, it's alright. You know, I mean, I see the news, you know. The other thing is the TV huffing the news, you know, to calm down and the paper. Don't depend on the paper too much. The news, yeah, watch the news and stuff and knew what kind of happen, but and it's to get rid of COVID by June.</br></br> 

It's June now and it's still COVID going on, you know what I mean. This is June 15th, supposed to get rid of it. And they're giving out vaccinations. [Unintelligible] out of here. [Unintelligible] as possible then you can [unintelligible] out here.</br></br> 

This is hard. So, put me in a better spot, you know.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: Try to get in the program. He said, yeah, you can go to a program, any program you want. Well then put me – and, like, send me to, like, [unintelligible] or something like that. Like, [unintelligible].</br></br>

UCI: Bellflower?</br></br>

Caller:  Have you heard of Bellflower?</br></br>

UCI: No, I have not. Is that in Orange County?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, it's Orange County.</br></br>

UCI: Oh, interesting.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, I'm trying to get into the program. So, you got people that contact you by name and [unintelligible]?</br></br>

UCI: So, we're basically students and we're just conducting this hotline where everybody - people can call in and tell us your stories regarding their experience with COVID-19. But, yeah, with that we would like to thank you very much for participating in PrisonPandemic. Please consider telling your friends about us and seeing if they would like to call in.
