This story was told by a person incarcerated at CMC (California Menâ€™s Colony).</br></br>

Caller: Now what they're permanently doing, is that if somebody gets COVID, they quarantine that building, send everybody as they find them and then test them and check vitals everyday to see if there is any signs of COVID among the people that live together.</br></br>
 
Being dorm living is restricted to 65 people per dorm. And they have separate rearranged the living quarters to have pods, which is what they call it, which is every six bunks they are bunched up together and there is a space in between them that is six feet apart.</br></br>

But you have let's say bunk 12, 13, 14 in regular spacing, which is about three feet from one another. And then you have lower, which is you and your bunkee within three feet. And then there is space and then it will be 16, 17, 18 all together then another space, six feet. So it is not really like isolation as they seem.
