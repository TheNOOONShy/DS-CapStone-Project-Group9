This story was told by a person incarcerated at Sonoma County Main Adult Detention Facility.</br></br>


Caller: Programs initially were shut down but the schools, the college I attended, they did a wonderful job figuring out how to continue to facilitate learning through correspondence. Although they were not set up for that, they quickly pivoted and were able to come out with classes and provide classes still to the population. So I thought that was commendable on their part.</br></br>


The staff, they did everything they could to help mitigate any of the spread. Although, of course, there were always things that could be debatable. This was something that was unprecedented and they did what they could for our case count there. Although we did end up getting COVID cases and it started to spread a little bit, it wasn’t as bad as some of the other prisons that I heard.</br></br>


I don’t know the statistics, I don’t know the numbers, I don’t know any of that stuff. All I know is from my own experience. Where I was at, it kept getting quarantined, a lot of people kept testing positive and they, you know, the–– especially the Level 2. It was pretty much designed for isolation.</br></br>


So based on the design itself, it’s the old SHU and how they structured the quarantine, it really slowed down the spread of COVID-19. Of course, there’s things where I wish they would be more lenient on, but they did it for our protection and I left there not getting sick.</br></br>


UCI: Wow.</br></br>


Caller: Yeah. I left there. I even got my vaccination, I made it out with my vaccination. I was pretty fortunate to be at the Pelican Bay, on a Level 2 yard.</br></br>


UCI: Was there anything that was really troubling or concerning you at the time? Like I mean, just from the beginning of the pandemic? Like your experience?</br></br>
 
Caller: For me, no. Like I said, I had more freedom, right? When they did open some programming, because initially everything got shut down because they were afraid it was going to spread. Once they saw that nothing was spreading, they opened up a little bit and they allowed us to go to work or go to school. Very limited amount of people.</br></br>


I was in a computer coding program and they gave social distancing. They allowed us to go to class. And there were some programs over there that they started running, social distancing, disinfecting everything, sanitizing everything. Like they had a whole group of people working together to keep the area clean.There were guys that were going up and down the halls sanitizing everything, the walls, every day.</br></br>


Everything was getting sanitized like three times a day over there. They supplied everything we needed. We had gloves, we had masks, we had disinfectant, we had everything we needed. We weren’t short for anything. And I heard that a lot of other places wasn’t that blessed. So my take on it was that I was fortunate to be where I was.</br></br>


UCI: Yeah, so it sounds like, just from an idea from month-to-month when the pandemic started, they shut everything down and as it progressed and you had no cases, they started opening things up? Does that sound about correct?</br></br>


Caller: One more time?</br></br>


UCI: Like in terms of month-to-month, of the situation when COVID started, say March on? They closed and you guys were on lock down but then slowly started to open up?</br></br>


Caller: Uh-huh.</br></br>


UCI: Okay. Just checking to make sure that that’s what happened, just cause we wanted to know about the timeline. How has the COVID-19 situation affected your loved ones?</br></br>


Caller: Well, of course, visitations were shut down, everything was shut down and nobody was allowed to get visits. They did offer free phone calls here and there and that was a blessing because I got to communicate with some family members that I hadn’t spoken to in a very long time.</br></br>


I just went back to court and if I didn’t come back in time, I would’ve been stuck in reception and it would’ve been all bad.  But I came back right in time and that’s when the governor shut down all transportation.</br></br>


So as you can see I was very fortunate because I got to stay in a place where I was very comfortable. If I was stuck in reception at Wasco or something? Living conditions were bad before, terrible over there already, before COVID. I don’t know how it was there afterwards.</br></br>


UCI: Wow.</br></br>


Caller: For me, I was very fortunate to be back at Pelican Bay, in a situation where COVID didn’t really affect that region too hard.</br></br>


UCI: What was it like for you having reduced visitation and programming? I mean at the beginning?</br></br>


Caller: Well, you know, living at Pelican Bay for a very long time, I was very far distance from a lot of family members and my community already, so I wasn’t really getting visits that often. I just started getting some visits. So I was used to not seeing them for like a year. Maybe once a year, I might see them. And that’s just within the last few years I started getting visits. It’s just too far away.</br></br>


I heard now that they started video visiting because right when I left, I heard that they were starting it but I didn’t know anyone that actually went yet because you had to be not in a quarantined block to go to video visitation. So I guess something good came out of the pandemic over there because there was no such thing as video visiting.</br></br>


Before, it was your family who had to come all the way up here to see you, fly or drive. You know, 20 something hours to get up here just to see you. Now there is an opportunity for you to see your family through video visitation, so that something cool that the CDCR pushed state-wide.</br></br>
