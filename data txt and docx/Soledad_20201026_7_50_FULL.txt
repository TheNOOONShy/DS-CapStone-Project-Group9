This story was told by a person incarcerated at Soledad.</br></br>

UCI: What is the current COVID situation at your facility? Is everything going okay, or?</br></br>

Caller: Okay, so when we first started, we were one of the prisons that there were no cases. What they did is they did a prison raid here, and they brought in a special agency outside of the prison.</br></br> 

And those guys contaminated the prison. From that point on, the maximum amount of cases we had was 168. We currently have only about 32 active cases.</br></br>

We have a couple of wings that are quarantined because if they - if one person gets it, what they do is take that person and put them into quar- I mean in the - they have a wing that they use just for COVID dudes, and then they have a wing that they quarantine you if they don't know if you got it. Like, you know, the incubation period.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: And then there's two wings down right now that are considered quarantine. And there's one building that they use for quarantine.</br></br> 

So they really have three buildings for quarantine and one for active cases. They use the gym for that. It's only 32 guys in there.</br></br>

The biggest experience is this: before COVID, the average inmate was out of his cell probably about 16 hours a day. So from 6:00 a.m. till 9:00 at night, he was out of his cell. Now he's in his cell all day.</br></br>

He comes out for showers every 72 hours. He only gets three to five hours of yard a week. So we're in our cell 160 hours a week.</br></br>

UCI: That’s definitely a drastic change.</br></br>

Caller: They only give us one roll of toilet paper, one bar of soap. If you can’t go to canteen, or anything like that, you're pretty much on your own if you can't get a package. They did allow us to get an extra COVID-19 package, but you have to pay for it. It's not like they gave it to you.</br></br>

Everything in here we have to buy, even though the tax man pays or the taxpayer pays billions of dollars for prisons. We buy our televisions, we buy our clothes. The only thing they give us is three small meals a day, power to the cell, and water in the cell. Everything else we have to - our families support us.</br></br>

So our families are sending, on average, for a guy that has support from $50 to $200 a month for canteen, and then they're sending packages every 90 days that cost anywhere from $100 to $300.</br></br>

We have television, but we only get like a couple of channels. There's no - we are, we don't have access to media like you would have like you have a Direct TV package, and you've got like 30, 40 channels, we don't have that. They've got the basic channels, ABC, NBC, CW.</br></br>

There is no library where you can go to. There's no dining room where they're allowing us to go to that. So before the COVID, you can go to that. There's no dining room activity.</br></br> 

There's no library activity. There's no education. There's no vocation. There's no rehabilitation classes being given at all.</br></br>

They are giving like handouts, everything's handouts, and the groups that are more powerful, they started doing Zoom stuff where they record it, and they played on the system.</br></br>

I'm at a facility that is, the capacity that it should be if it was one man in a cell, it'd be about 1,400 people. We got like 2,000 people here right now. And they're talking about sending 500 people from DVI and then talking about sending guys from San Quentin.</br></br> 

So we would definitely be over capacity. So, in a prison, in a facility that's built for about 1,400 people, they're trying to put 2,800 here.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, that's not good.</br></br>

Caller: There's no visiting. There's no visiting at all. So you're basically getting mail, you get phone calls, because they have phones in the building, and they have phones on the yard. So you get access to the phone, but that's sporadic.</br></br>

UCI: Do you know how sporadic it is?</br></br>

Caller: Say that again?</br></br>

UCI: Do you know like how often you can use the phones?</br></br>

Caller: Oh, you can use the phone when you shower every three days. So, every 72 hours, they let you shower. And when you come out for a shower, they let out a small group of people. They don't let out more than 16 people at a time.</br></br>

Oh, to give you a logistical thing, the housing units, two of them hold 350, every other housing unit holds 250. And there's 10 housing units here, so we have eight housing units that hold 250, and two that hold 350. That's if they're double cells.</br></br>

UCI: So how have you been coping, like, emotionally and mentally, with everything that’s been going on?</br></br>

Caller: I’m a unique individual. I read, I read a lot. And I spend a lot of time reading. Oh, that's the other thing.</br></br> 

You can take college courses. They're doing like a distance learning thing where they give you the books, and then you know, they give you a workbook to work out of, and then you do the work, and then you send it in; they come and collect it. So that's still active.</br></br>

And then we have a couple of colleges, like down there by you. They have a DVD system where they have DVDs that you can watch and you can take courses on and then - but with Proposition 57, all the college programs are impacted because people can get time off.</br></br> 

So everyone's trying to take those. They're hard to get in. I was just a lucky guy.</br></br>

UCI: That’s good. So, do you have any idea of what needs to be done to make the situation better?</br></br>

Caller: Well, first of all, they should have no housing unit with more than 90 percent occupancy. That's the first thing because we live - everything we do is in groups. They have too many people in each facility, in each housing unit, of these prisons.</br></br> 

So, no matter what, there's no spacing. You can't even be in a cell by yourself. So, if they can get the prison system down to about 95 percent of occupancy, that would, that would be the only thing that could work.</br></br>

The other thing is if there's a vaccine that comes along, but the problem is before the vaccine, all the employees here go home at night. So they're exposed to COVID, and then they work in here. So we get - they have one nurse that infected like 10 people because she got it, and she was handing out their medication, and so they - everybody that she handed out their medication with got COVID.</br></br>

So one of our biggest things in here, and there's a thing going on with this stimulus check that they said inmates can get it. So that's gonna help these guys because a lot of guys don't have money, and they can't buy the supplies they need. They have to borrow or barter for ‘em.</br></br> 

Most of the most important things is like toothpaste, deodorant, stuff like that. You have to buy all that stuff. They don't give that to you.</br></br>

There's a perception that when they say they pay $80-$90,000 per inmate that they're actually giving us that. The inmate receives about $1,800 worth of services, that's including your medical, power to the cell, and all that, and your meal plan.</br></br> 

They - the meal plan, they pay - they budget $3.50 per day per inmate for three meals. So you can imagine what size those meals are.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: You have people here that weigh anywhere from, you know, 175 to 250 pounds. That's one of the things, hunger is a real issue in here. You know, mental health is - if you put in to see the psych, they come and get you immediately, that's not a problem.</br></br>

We've only had one death at this prison for COVID-19, and we've only had one suicide this year at this facility, which is kind of good because normally there's like five to 10 a year. So the mental health department, you know, they're really trying to help people. There's no visiting, so that makes people kind of feel weird.</br></br>

But one of the things is if they can give us some type of care packages, you know, with hygiene.
