UCI: And how have you been coping with the crisis?</br></br> 

Caller: Well staying, well staying positive, I guess. Myself, I’m a Christian so I pray a lot of course. I pray, exercise, exercise will be probably the biggest thing. Oh and the other thing is that the college classes that I-</br></br>

The class, the classes, the class assignments are pretty good, they’re keeping me busy.</br></br> 

UCI: Yeah, that’s good.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah that was good thing. And I, everybody have to, kind of, do your own thing you got to know how to cope with it I believe. And I myself, I’m serving life without, I’ve been incarcerated over 20 years, I’ve been in worse situation. I’ve been under lockdown, two man cell, for nine months so, I think I’m coping okay. Yeah, I build a tolerance.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah definitely. What else do you want people to know about your experience?</br></br>

Caller: I want people to understand that, we are very, we are in a very vulnerable situation and I- I know people out there are suffering from many social interaction restriction and other normal things that you cannot do. I want people to take encouragement from what we going through here. Such as lockdown situation right now we facing in California. This is something we go through everyday myself been through past 20 some years.</br></br> 

And there’s always light at the end of the tunnel. And always have to just stay positive and think positive.Things change and we are, we are, we are resilient, I mean we adapt to new environment situations so if I have any, if this recording to reach to people out there, I want to encourage people out there I don’t have much complaining, what it is right now. Yeah, we just got to learn to accept the new things and adapt to the new norms.</br></br>
