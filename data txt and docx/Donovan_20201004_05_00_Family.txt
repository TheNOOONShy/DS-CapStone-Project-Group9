This story was told by a person incarcerated at Donovan.</br></br>

Caller: Inmates' concern - a big concern is not being able to see our families because visitation is shut down.</br></br>Guys are worried about one small outbreak spreading to, you know, spreading quickly. Because we don't know what that will mean for the rest of the yard. I think a big part of it is the additional shock is over.</br></br>And the problem is this like continuing - it feels like a drawn out process for a lot of guys. And they're kind of wanting to get back to normal, just as everybody is. But seeing each other's family is the biggest issue right now.</br></br>UCI: Yeah. That</br></br>Caller: You know.</br></br>UCI: makes sense.</br></br>Caller: And, obviously, we can't do that.</br></br>UCI: How has this been affecting your family, if you don't mind me asking?</br></br>Caller: It has been difficult. There has been a lot of change in my family right now. And, without going into too much detail, I don't know how I will see them in the future.</br></br>Because, well, I could have been able to see them before. But, going into the future - if visiting opens up, say, tomorrow or something - then, I won't be able to see them. So - my family - it's difficult because there was no like, I guess, closure. And, again, without going into too much detail, but it has been difficult in my family.</br></br>One of my close family members - I'm kind of the only person that they go see. So they kind of feel isolated that they can't go out and see family. Because this particular family member doesn't have a lot of family in the area. So there was that one connection.</br></br>Letters are great. Phone calls are great. But there is still something lost between that face-to-face sit down at a table with someone. So it has been very difficult for my family that is here.</br></br>UCI: I'm sorry to hear that.</br></br>Caller: Yeah. Well, it's, you know, that's the way it is for everybody, unfortunately. You know? Not just people in here.</br></br>UCI: Yeah.</br></br>Caller: But there's a lot of guys who want to see their wives, a lot of guys who want to see their parents. Aging population has aging parents.
