Well hello there stranger, Ms. [redacted] and all others who are part of this project and may read this letter . . .!</br></br>

First and foremost, I’d like to wish all the lovely ladies involved a . . .</br></br>

Happy Valentine’s Day!</br></br>

Although I don’t know you, I’m sure you all are strong, smart, amazing, and a force to behold every day of the year, not just Feb. 14th… So please know that even a stranger can praise you all from afar based on your kindness by being involved in this project… You all are appreciated, needed, and special…</br></br>

As for any guys involved, thanks for your support and time, you’re just not as desirable as the ladies . . . kidding!</br></br>

Speaking for myself and a few others thank you kindly for the care packages we received . . . Honestly the jerky was right on time to cure my craving!!!</br></br>

Here is a little bit about myself just so you know a little more about at least one life your project has touched!</br></br>

My name is [redacted]. I’m 37 years old currently in prison for being in possession of a firearm! I am someone who has been incarcerated more than enough times to know better. This is my 4th term in California, I’m not a weirdo or violent person, I’m just a regular guy who likes to have too much fun and has become a victim of California’s revolving prison door.</br></br>

All due to my poor choices I assure you but by no means do I qualify as a bad person, lost cause, or unworthy of saving! Some guidance, helping hand, a little growing up on my end and I assure you I’m not much different than many of you except a lot more tattoos, and a lot of catching up to do….</br></br>

I was told by medical personnel here that I had COVID, I never felt any symptoms or experienced anything concerning, for that I’m blessed yet still confused on its potential for damage to people's lives and health.</br></br>

I do have elderly parents who use supplemental oxygen, live-in healthcare provider, prime candidates for worst case outcome with COVID! As of today I’m lucky to report they are still above ground, healthy as their ages and conditions allow. I do understand the possibility of never getting to hug my mother again if she does contract the virus, and honestly its a reality I’d prefer not to think about or stress on until that time comes because there isn’t anything I can do but hate myself for choosing to put myself in this position by my actions!! Honestly I just hope for the best, deal with the mess if and when the time comes!</br></br>

As for others I see them affected by no family visits, worry about loved ones, the normal. I think because they claim so many of us had the virus yet nobody really was affected extremely bad or lack of death within the prison, most people don’t take the situation as seriously as they should . . .</br></br>

I believe had the virus taken more of a toll health-wise or more people affected by the loss of loved ones in the free world… The average person here is too much of an idiot to understand what’s going on in other places, or too ignorant to take the time to notice what’s going on around them, let alone what’s happening elsewhere in the world!</br></br>

It’s a shame to admit because I’m forced to live with and dress like every other prisoner here, guilty by association, but honestly a lot of the people here don’t try to think bigger, content to accept this as a way of life, a badge of honor among the gangstas, or they are ok with being here because it offers them a better life than they could provide for themselves . . .</br></br>

I’m sure many of you smile to yourself thinking ‘this guy already admitted he’s been locked up multiple times so what’s his issue,’ but I assure you I’m one of the few who know they are better, can do better, think bigger, want more, care about the state of despair we as a country are currently experiencing, and last but not least, I’m still, even after multiple failures, unwilling to accept this to be my hand in life or be content to be here, without dreams of one day getting my shit together and move on with my life, making my story as a convict nothing more than a couple chapters in my life story, instead of it just being the story! And most importantly I know without a doubt that I have the courage, know-how, and ability to make it happen!</br></br>

So to sum up my personal COVID-19 story, convict-edition.</br></br>

Finally now at the ripe young age of 37, I’ve awoke one morning more man than free-spirited good-time kid, with the ability that comes with a certain level of wisdom found only in mature, usually adult-aged persons. Some are blessed/cursed earlier than others, some never figure it out but most “men” realize in their mid- to late-30s . . . </br></br>

When tomorrow is no longer certain, you do things with thoughts of tomorrow or down the road. When consequences are considered before action is taken, can’t party like you used to… All of a sudden you awake a grown up… Think different, see different, silly things matter, time is actually valued as important.</br></br>

People my age graduated high school, went to college, got married, made families, careers, bought homes, lived life… Years I wasted, yet at 37, still plenty of time to work toward 401k, buy house, have family, live life… If I grow up now, plan for tomorrow, I got plenty of time left to make it all happen but my chances are running out, now or never! My COVID story is a man who grows up in time, smart enough to know the difference, strong-willed enough to make it happen, found a respect for the future and my place in it.</br></br>

As of this moment I haven’t lost anything but time and whatever I freely gave up due to my choices to party and have fun! Clock is ticking either continue down the short-lived fun road with major consequences, or play the long game, long term investment short gains that will accumulate over time!</br></br>

I, my dear stranger friends, will accept the challenge, grow up, and do something more with my life, and thankful for the chance! Funny part of this is I bet I’m the only person I know who believe this possible or even that I’d ever consider growing up! I guess that will be a surprise for us all.</br></br>

By the way thank you again, for the letter, your concern, the care package, and the time any of you cared to spare just to read what I’ve written!</br></br>

My plan for a career is to get my Class-A license, do some long haul and save money… A single man, no bills, no kids, no real obligations other than putting my life together… Bottom yearly income $25,000-$30,000 a year minimum, better once experienced and find a good company! 37 years old, wise enough to live frugally and save $. Figure 5 years tops I will be in position to set myself up anywhere!!! So please if you, anyone, have the time and resources, please send me any and all information regarding truck-driving schools. I’m from NorCal area, [redacted] County but will consider relocating for promising opportunity. A solid career with minimal education to obtain . . </br></br>

Read somewhere long ago: “Failing to plan is planning to fail”</br></br>

And lastly but still important is my pitch of finding a pen-pal. Like I said I’m no weirdo, check me out if need be. Looking for a fun, intelligent woman who is interested in a good time, getting to know the mind and heart of a convict, must be open-minded, not faint-of-heart, interesting, honest, funny with a sense of humor, not afraid to flirt or be dirty, willing to share true self, not looking for anything more than some fun and pass the time! I don’t need any money or will I try to hustle you for anything down the road… I have 6-8 months left on my sentence and wish for nothing more than looking forward to mail, call, and passing the time!</br></br>

Trust and believe it will be a hell of a journey should any of you pretty ladies have a little extra time to share!</br></br>

I send my best to any and all, thanks for all that your project has done thus far. Looking forward to hearing back either from anyone involved in this project or even better any adventurous thrill-seekers willing to drop a few lines personally!!!</br></br>

Sincerely.</br></br>

P.S. Smile anyway!
