Dear PrisonPandemic,</br></br>


Nice to meet you! Hello. Well you picked the right person to write to because I love writing letters. I will share info with you as long as you promise to be my pen-pal for life. I am doing life in prison by the way for self defense slash murder!! Anyhow you must promise to keep writing me. I like college by the way. Well we can get to know  each other personally, by the way just so we are all comfortable with each other with all due respect I am no weirdo and I’m not a sex-offender! OR pervert!</br></br>


So now that I got that out of the way I hope you understand that I’m a solid dude...Well let me introduce myself I’m white 49 years old 5’ 10” tall from Los Angeles. Never been married and no kids I’m single and currently serving life in prison.</br></br>


So once again I love writing and I hope you or any of your friends are welcome to write me OH by the way you don't have to keep my stuff anonymous. I keep it real and 100% true and honest. Well since you would love to hear from my experiences I will write you tons of info.</br></br>


So your first question what has it been like during the COVID-19 pandemic? Well let me tell you being in prison sucks. So heres my story: I was transferred from Sierra Conservation Center in Jamestown to San Quentin State prison in June 2020 I was placed in the hole “ad-seg” as I was “quarantined” for 14 days. This was during the time when C.D.C.R. had transferred 15 inmates from Chino prison and some of those inmates were infected with COVID therefore spreading the virus from prison to prison.</br></br> 


So Im sure you have heard on the news about San Quentin and the outbreak. Well I was there! For five months! Okay when I found out that I was trapped in San Quentin with COVID there was only over 100 cases of COVID in my unit Carson section. Quickly within a few months it went to 600 then 1500 then over 2600 inmates infected with 26 inmates dead and one sergeant from the prison dead.</br></br> 


I actually was so scared and lucky that I did not get the virus because I never came out of my cell I refused to move and got a write up for refusing to house then it was my fan that saved me. I tied my fan to the bars of the cell and blew all the negative air out of my cell. I put newspaper and the lower half of my bars to block germs and hung up sheets on the top just my fan blew out air. I washed up in my cell instead of going out to the shower I cleaned my walls floor sink and toilet and clothes daily and luckily I did not contract COVID.


At the same time San-Quentin is a very dirty mice running around and the guards failed to separate the infected inmates that’s why 2600 people got COVID there. Anyway the end of September of 2020 I was transferred from San Quentin to Valley State Prison in Chowchilla I was so happy to get away from San Quentin what a dump. And let me tell you the guards and CDCR are lazy and crooked they don’t care about us.</br></br> 


Okay I got transferred to Valley State Prison and I was there from the end of September then at the end of November I got infected with COVID-19. Oh by the way Valley State Prison and eight men pods where San Quentin was cells. Anyway I was in a small pod or dorm with seven other inmates when one guy infected us all. I then was moved 11 times in Valley State within two months!!</br></br>


How unprofessional Valley State Prison is! They shuffled us around like sardines or goldfish in a tank… I went from B yard Bldg 3 -- to A yard Bldg. 3 -- then back to B yard Bldg 4 -- then to the gym -- then back to B yard Bldg 4 -- then to B-yard Bldg 1 -- then to C yard bldg 4 -- then back to B yard Bldg. 3. Valley State Prison is so unprofessional in their ways of dealing with sick people! Luckily, I did not get too sick just loss of energy, chills and flu-like symptoms.</br></br> 


Anyway I never got evaluated by a doctor just temperature checks and blood pressure. No Tylenol or Motrin. Valley State Prison really sucks. I actually went on suicide watch to get away from people.</br></br> 


Well after I got resolved in Valley State Prison I was moved to B-yard in 3 building where they asked for volunteers to work in the main kitchen. I went to work for two weeks working in the bakery making dinner rolls, hoagie rolls and cake. The free staff cooks and guards liked my work ethics so they asked me if I wanted a job but the position available was in the Vegetable Room chopping vegetables. I agreed.</br></br>


I worked in the Veggie Room for a week and a half but I was being mistreated and bullied by another inmate so I went to fight him but the guards handcuffed me. I lost my job then I went to work in the other kitchen as a volunteer working in the Scullery washing trays and serving food. It was nice. This was around the New Year of 2021. I made some good wine for myself for New Years out of pineapple juice and some jelly with apples.</br></br>


I got a pretty good buzz from the wine that I made. I usually am clean and sober but all the moving around and mistreatment I went through I decided to make myself a little short dog. I think I deserved it.</br></br>


Anyhow I ended up getting into a fight and I went to the hole for a couple of months where I ended up getting a total of seven write ups! I did this to raise my custody points so I could be transferred to cell living.</br></br>


I recently was transferred to R.J. Donovan in San Diego in March 2021, where I was quarantined for 14 days again. I take a psych. Medication called Seroquel for paranoia. I also have P.T.S.D. and Im bipolar. Since they refused to give me my medication for two days I had gotten so paranoid that I made a knife and then the next day instead of stabbing someone I turned it in and got into trouble for the weapon so now Im in the hole again until the end of July.</br></br>


Well as for your next question: as far as my safety inside? I feel that if Im staying away from people and staying clean which Im a very clean person then I’ll be okay. I do not get visits so thats out of the question.</br></br>


Well as far as how Ive been coping with this crisis. Its been a big mess for me. Ive purposely gotten into trouble just to be single cell and to be by myself. Well before I left my last prison Valley State in March 2021 I got my first COVID vaccine there.</br></br>


Valley State is in central California and they were pretty good about giving vaccines there. It has not been three weeks yet for me to get my second Pfizer vaccine but when the time comes and I recover from the side effects I will be informing you.</br></br>


Well I will write two more pages about myself to you if I don’t get a return letter out of this I will be upset! In your letter you mention that you cannot respond to everyone individually. Well listen, I am different! I provide info: So please write back to me. I will inform you of all incidents.</br></br>


Well as of the present moment I am currently housed in Donovan State Prison in San Diego, California. I am in Administration Segregation as known as “the hole.” I am in a cell by myself and I clean it daily. Anyway, I recently received the first stimulus 1200.00 check, but have not received the second 600.00 or third 1400.00 check yet.</br></br>


Anyhow to tell you a little more about myself, my occupational skills are layout carpentry and welders helper...painter...I like mountain bike riding, camping, surfing at the beach and fishing. Well I send you all my good positive thoughts as well. Oh by the way my name is [redacted]. D. is my middle name [redacted] -- but my first name is [redacted].</br></br>


Anyhow in your last part of your letter you mention that you believe in me. Well thank you. So since you say that you now must prove it and write back to me and share some of your life with me as well. Then I will continue to write more and more to share whatever you want. About prison life.</br></br>


Well once upon a time! Anyway I grew up in a small city called Hawaiian Gardens near Long Beach. Where are you from? So you’re college women? What is your major and what classes are you taking? I just completed one semester of Counseling 100 in a book called Becoming A Master Student. I got three weeks off of my sentence for that.</br></br>


Anyway my possible release date is July of the year 2047. I’ll be 77 years old if I live that long. Anyhow I only have one person who corresponds with me right now. She is a lady fried whom I grew up with. Then, all of a sudden you write! Well dont be afraid to keep writing to me because I really love to write because it makes me feel good.</br></br> 


Anyway I lived in L.A. from 1979 to 2008 then I moved to Blythe, CA. on the Colorado River on the Arizona border. I was doing good from 2008 to 2011 I had a job at the fairgrounds and I mowed several people’s lawns and worked in the fields picking corn and melons.</br></br>


I also went to the river to float on inter tubes; jet ski and go out on boats. I also fished the river and canals catching catfish; largemouth bass and bluegill. I had four girlfriends in four years!</br></br>


Anyhow in 2011 I was at the park along the river drinking vodka with a homeless man and he attacked me with a knife stabbing me four times. He cut my hand its I blocked the knife. I have 10 staples and permanent damage. So sorry for the sloppy writing.</br></br>


Anyhow I wook the knife away from him and I stabbed him back numerous times as a result he died and I lost in court and got second degree murder. If I would have just ran home and called 911 he would have been in jail.</br></br>


Anyhow my hand is really starting to hurt so I will take a break. Well I guess Ill end this six page letter to you and please write back to me with more questions or whatever you need to ask Im willing to answer anything you want. It was a pleasure writing to you and I really hope we can continue to correspond with each other.</br></br>


If you’re not interested in writing me please pass my address to someone who is interested. I will remain your friend for life, take care… well God bless you, your friends and family.</br></br>


With respect,</br></br>


Please write back! Peace out...
