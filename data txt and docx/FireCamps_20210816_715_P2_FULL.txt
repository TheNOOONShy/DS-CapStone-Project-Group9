This story was told by a person incarcerated at Fire Camp.</br></br> 

Caller: Hello?</br></br>

UCI: Hello. Hey, how's it going?</br></br>

Caller: It's going good. Right on, I got you back.</br></br>

UCI: Nice. Yeah, still UCI pandemic. I've already read the consent statement to you, so you can just keep on going with your story, and we should be able to cut it straight through.</br></br>

Caller: Excellent. Thank you very much. So, where was I? Oh, so we had cross-contaminated with other individuals.</br></br>

UCI: You were talking about -- you were talking about how conditions, CDCR in Jamestown is responsible for the outbreak at where?</br></br>

Caller: At Sierra Conservation.</br></br>

UCI: At Sierra Conservation Center.</br></br>

Caller: So the numbers -- Correct. So, what I was talking about was the numbers. So, on June the 20th, when we left, there was seven cases, I believe. Yeah, roughly seven cases.</br></br>

Within three weeks, there was over 100 cases. Active positive COVID cases. They were trying their best to isolate the inmates who were contaminated by putting them in the gymnasium on the A yard on the level one and two side.</br></br>

And on the level C block, which is for higher-level inmates three and four, they were putting them in a quarantine block. So, it was in-cell living, yet they were quarantined.</br></br>

Now, one thing that I find to be interesting, that I continue to bring up to staff is, I have personally been quarantined roughly 11 times since October of last year. Most of the inmates that were going from -- coming from reception to Jamestown, or going from Jamestown to a camp, or from other reception facilities to other facilities, we all have to go through a quarantine process.</br></br>

When we leave county jail, we get quarantine on the way into county jail, and we quarantine on the way out of county jail. We get quarantine when we hit reception; we get quarantine as we leave reception.</br></br>

So, the COVID-19 can't -- should not be coming in through the inmates. The COVID-19 is coming through -- through free staff and correction officers. So, I'm sitting there going, well, why am I the one quarantining when you're the one who's giving it to me?</br></br>

UCI: Exactly. Exactly.</br></br>

Caller: Because -- do you remember when AIDS was a big deal back in the 1980s and 90s?</br></br>

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: They had people going around, and they were pricking people with needles that had the AIDS virus on it.</br></br>

UCI: Right.</br></br>

Caller: And there was also a couple of cases where people were having intercourse knowing that they have HIV, they're HIV positive and they didn't tell the other person and district attorneys in New York and Los Angeles, in other major cities, Chicago, they were picking these cases up and charging attempted murder.</br></br>

UCI: Really?</br></br>

Caller: Oh yeah, most definitely.</br></br>

UCI: Jesus!</br></br>

Caller: My question is this - you can look that up; how, because, since the pandemic is so real and the Delta variant is killing people all over the nation, how is it possible to not hold these corrections officers liable for afflicting inmates and/or exposing them to COVID-19?</br></br>

UCI: I'm writing a policy memo on it right now.</br></br>

Caller: With all due respect, I understand that, you know, as an inmate, we have to do our time and that we have, some of us, certain crimes that we are accused of, and we have a debt to pay to society, but at what cost?</br></br>

UCI: But at what cost, yes?</br></br>

Caller: At what cost is the question? Because one death, I mean as far as I'm concerned, you can't put a price tag on human life. If one person dies, which we know for an absolute fact in San Quentin and Tracy and other facilities, there have been deaths. How do you apologize for that life that has been lost?</br></br>

Especially when, in my opinion, which is based on firsthand experience, they do not follow any proper contamination protocols. And the Director of Health at Sierra Conservation Center in Jamestown, California, was specifically notified by myself that we had made physical contact in the public in two specific locations.</br></br>

She refused to notify CDC or the local health officials to launch the track and trace program to notify these individuals that they may have come into contact with COVID-positive people so that they could have the option of say, I don't know, boosting their immune system through vitamins.</br></br>

Dr. [redacted] of the Sierra Conservation Center, who was given the exact information of where we stopped, what time we stopped, how long we were there for. The scenario was described to her in detail from a 602 that I wrote and a 22 form that I submitted and a letter that I wrote describing the women and children that were out in the present, in line, waiting for us to finish using the water fountain as we were exposed to a gentleman who had had direct COVID exposure, that was put in the transpac van with us.</br></br>

UCI: Where's the accountability?</br></br>

Caller: Now, is that a rhetorical question?</br></br>

UCI: Yes.</br></br>

Caller: Because I don't have an answer.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, exactly.</br></br>

Caller: The accountability lies, hopefully in my end because I've reached out to my people and told them to reach out to the local health officials to let them know that they need to do something about this because the doctor at Sierra Conservation Center has refused to do anything, and so has any and all personnel that I personally reached out to at the Sierra Conservation Center.</br></br>

Now, let's go back to their failure to put in place any logical COVID-19 exposure contamination containment protocols. Part of their containment protocol was to have the porters, who are inmates, that basically participate in slave labor, so they get out of their cells for additional time, they cut up a sheet, a CDCR issued sheet, they cut it up into three-inch strips, and they created a special barrier in a section of the C block where we were being housed for our quarantine.</br></br>

So, I'm a level one inmate, and I'm being held in a level three-yard, which is illegal, it's a violation of title 15 classification, but they were doing it out of convenience at the Sierra Conservation Center. They took this special CDCR sheet up, had the inmates do it, and that was the COVID barrier.</br></br> 

My question was, okay, so now that you're using this special CDCR issued sheet COVID-19 protection barrier, what about the recirculating air that we're all sharing with these men?</br></br>

If we're going to be inside of cell living, okay, and we're going to be in recirculating air conditions, why don't you have this whole entire block be a transpac block versus having us sitting here with other persons that have access to staff that are coming in and out who catch COVID?</br></br>

UCI: Absolutely.</br></br>

Caller: Because three people on the C block caught COVID while we're in quarantine. And I'm sitting there going, is the special CDCR issued sheet gonna prevent that COVID from coming in here? Furthermore, the porter who caught it was delivering our foods trays that were not disposable. I think I need an Amen.</br></br>

UCI: A fucking men. Goddammit. That is -- I'm just so happy that somebody like yourself was able to experience that so that you were able to relate that story, dude. That's -- that's nuts.</br></br>

Caller: That's the beginning of the story. That's just at the Sierra Conservation Story. Over at -- over at Delano, over at Delano, the reception area that I was in, it's even better, it's even more unbelievable.</br></br>

UCI: Oh, Jesus.</br></br>

Caller: The level of incompetence exercised by CDCR is paramount, to say the least. I'm literally looking at somebody at the windows of their souls; I'm trying to climb into the eye socket and trying get to the nuclei of the brain stem to explain this to these people. What you are doing makes absolutely no logical sense.</br></br>

You're putting us in a high-risk scenario that can be avoided through quarantining us in a dorm on the A yard where we would be completely isolated from everybody else. Why aren't you doing that?</br></br>

So then because I was putting in so many complaints, they actually started to do -- the protocol, but it was too late because the outbreak had already started, and they couldn't -- they could not contain it. I don't know what the numbers are over there now. I pray and hope that they're stabilized, or at least declining.</br></br>

What I do know is that they are now, because the Sierra Conservation Center of Jamestown is like a reception for fire camp; they have sent out mandatory tests and quarantine orders to some fire camps; which ones, I do not know. But for sure, they shut down this fire camp.</br></br>

So, Gabilan fire camp is not an active fire camp at the moment. We're currently under a two-week quarantine where they are using the PRC test, which has been recalled.</br></br>

UCI: Wow.</br></br>

Caller: So, when the nurse appeared shoving a swab up your nose, and you're like, "Oh, okay, is this the rapid test or the three-day test?" "We're not sure."</br></br>

"Oh, is this the PRC test?" "Oh, yes, it is." "Well, hasn't that been recalled?" "No." Okay, you don't know what you're talking about.</br></br>

UCI: Wow. So the information is not even getting to the staff. Forget the staff think that they're doing the right thing. Sometimes the information doesn't even get to the staff.</br></br>

Caller: Right. It would be nice to have the information, so we at least know where we stand. But they don't provide it. The typical answer is, from staff, because I typically would -- will grill, every time they gave me a COVID test, I would be like, "Okay, is this the rapid test? Is this the long-term test? Are you guys going to be able to sequence the test if I do test positive to find out what variant I have?"</br></br>

Because I'm fully aware that if I have a common cold, I can come up positive with the COVID test, because you guys aren't sequencing the results. Anyone can manipulate a statistic. I'm fully aware of this.</br></br>

So, when I hear the news, and they say, "Oh well, 53 percent of people have the Delta variant." I'm like, "Okay, but you tested 10 people, and 5 people and one maybe gives you 53 percent." I'm not stupid.</br></br>

So, when I'm asking these types of questions to CDCR staff, the nurses, they may be subcontractors, I'm not sure, so I can't really say that with 100 percent confidence, but they don't know. They have no answers.</br></br>

And then when you go into depth about the different variations or the absolute fact that COVID-19 is a manmade virus, which more than likely is, was biological warfare gone wrong, they have no clue. You start talking about the fact that there's a patent on the virus, and they sit there dumbfounded. And it's amazing. Those are more opinions.</br></br>

Let me get back to the facts here. And I'm sorry that I'm running on. But I've been holding on to this information and trying to reach out to a legitimate source for so long.</br></br>

UCI: That's incredible. I'm so happy that we were able to provide some agency and a voice for you. Yeah, keep going.</br></br>

Caller: This is the ultimate platform. Huge shout-out to the Prison Pandemic Project at UC Irvine because it takes the time to hear these voices. We are being silenced. This is, what do they call it? Censorship at its finest. The inmate is typically abused, silenced, sheltered, forced into a hole, and we cannot speak about what's going on behind these walls.</br></br>

Me, myself, personally; I exercise my first amendment right every opportunity I get, and I have no fear of the repercussions. So, I will gladly speak about these things again and again and again.</br></br>

UCI: Amen.</br></br>

Caller: Do I do one more callback or?</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, go for it.</br></br>

Caller: Alright, let's do one more. I'll give you a call right back.</br></br>

UCI: Yep, yep.</br></br>
