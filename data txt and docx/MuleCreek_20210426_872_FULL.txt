To PrisonPandemic,</br></br>I received your letter April 22, 2021. From the beginning of government involvement of personal medical death until now where they will struggle to get immunity through a vaccine I worried how long my prayers would last. I pray daily mostly non-verbally. I am in an environment of government operation. When that environment is new CDCR uses control. So to know there is an archive in Irvine thank heavens.</br></br> The state’s best response is record. My criminal record began at the state level in 1986. Here goes my convictions, 1986: burglary and armed robbery, 1990: attempted burglary, 1993: assault with a deadly weapon, 2000: corporal injury to a spouse, 2005: murder lying in wait, 1990-2002: seven probation/parole violations.</br></br>Since 1986 has not been free of a prison on jail for over a year straight. I’m 1989-90 so I graduated high school. I played varsity basketball for high school in Tacna, Arizona, Yuma County. My highest point total for a single game was 31 I missed two shots. I am only six feet tall I was a guard. Trust me eight minute quarters 31 points is a peaceful thought.</br></br>Back to the pandemic. My mother died of stroke at 74 years of age in 2020. She was in Oregon! Without a doubt the testing has to be mobile and done in large numbers like I witnessed here in prison early on. Bed movers of the infected at Mule Creek was done horrible.</br></br>When a person tested positive they began quarantine in the gymnasium. Weekly tests continued in the cell blocks where the non-mobile bunks existed. As long as you did not show infection you stayed where you was at. When the non-infection test showed to the individual the goal of CDCR was to fill the bunks again in the regular housing.</br></br>I was one that did not test positive for COVID-19. The people that did was put right back where I was at. Since my Pfizer vaccine in February they completely stopped testing me. So the testing is a current failure and the vaccination housing of inmates is non-existent in CDCR.</br></br>It took the state awhile to realize how serious the Federal Government was going to take the pandemic. Now once the prison has community support and COVID-19 as an excuse continue programs have to be well advised before given the control. I am a murderer. I billed one person with a .38 revolver. Police reform begins with conviction.</br></br>My case has to show less forgiveness for the convictions to begin properly with the police! The murderer has to be written to prove fear, prove education, and even me to prove record! I am in a place for murderer to find a heart and plea for forgiveness. But guess what I believe in reform and education my call would show me un-educated in murder and lean to voluntary manslaughter.</br></br>Once a police officer is fingered out as the educated the conviction will stick. Remember I will share my stories just ask away and remember correspondence needs small financial peace and support. I have been in prison since 118 days after September 2001. I waived my appeal and for one murder I carry three life sentence. I have been violent in here.</br></br>I have a staff assault, they knocked my teeth out. They are smart at what they do until the witness happens to an individual. I am mentally ill from meth abuse. I don’t believe in conspiracies. I rather believe in abuse. God is powerful and suicide is easy. So remember this when you ask because I will try to answer for my God in heaven when it is all said and done.</br></br>
