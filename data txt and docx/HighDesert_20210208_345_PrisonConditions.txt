This letter was written by a person incarcerated at High Desert. </br></br>

That California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitations has been trying to fight this crazy battle with the virus. But lockdowns with infected cellmates is obviously not the answer. I was negative the three and a half months I was in reception. Only to be moved from reception to another prison where the whole yard has been infected. The correctional officers housed me in the hot housing.</br></br> 

The block I was housed in was infected and moved me in with three different cellmates that has caught the virus. I really feel like the COs don't care if I'm healthy and COVID-free. One of the COs made a comment of "you're gonna catch it anyways, so who cares, get it over with."
