This story was told by a person incarcerated at Solano.</br></br>Caller: Okay, I am currently at CSP Solano.</br></br>We’ve had a COVID-19 outbreak here. I mean this is what they’re telling us. But some of the issues that we’re dealing with here, I have like, let me see, I have like 13 points to my agenda here. That are some of the things that I would like to go over with you.</br></br>  One, the first is the probably the most important, is they have exposed us to the COVID-19 virus and through their ineffective and irresponsible collection and testing protocols here. What they’ve been doing is they’ve been bringing medical staff into our dorms, and they’re bringing medical staff, and the medical staff are not changing their PPE out. They’re testing guys through the nasal swab, and they’re taking, putting the collection into a glass tube, and then they’re moving on to the next inmate. They’re not changing their- they didn’t change their gloves, they didn’t change their PPE, they didn’t change anything.</br></br>  So, prior to that, none of us were sick. We were all healthy, and for me and myself, I was in Building 16, in Dorm 16, and none of us were sick in there. And then they came and tested us, and they used that procedure. And then they came a second time to test us and used the same procedure, and then we all started coming down with the COVID virus at that point.</br></br>  After that, they said that we were, they condemned our dorm, and they started mixing the population and circulating the prison population by moving us from Dorm 16 to Building 7, which is on a whole ‘nother facility. To the B, to the Facility B gym, and now currently we’re in the Facility C gym. And they’re doing this with hundreds of men. So, it’s like, it’s like something that the virus is thriving in, is this circulation, this, it’s like they’re transferring us inter-institution, but the virus is thriving in that condition.</br></br>  UCI: Right.</br></br>    Caller: So, a lot us, yeah. So a lot of us got really sick, and we have all types of symptoms. Body aches, congestion, high fever, loss of smell, loss of taste, the chills, bone aches, lethargy.</br></br>  UCI: Mhmm.</br></br>    Caller: A number of things.
