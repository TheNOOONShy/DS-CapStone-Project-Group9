How can you say something like that? They're not treating this virus like it's real. This is life or death! I was sentenced to six years, not death.</br></br> 

I'm scared of this virus? Hell yes! I have a little girl that I'm trying to come back home to and raise. I'm forced to sit here till my release date. All I did was have drugs on me. I didn't ransack the capitol. They even got a pardon from the president.</br></br>

I'm just trying to come home safe and COVID-free to my family. I miss them and worry about them so much. It becomes hard for me doing time I shouldn't be doing. I'm going on 24 months for a possession. Hopefully something happens where drug charges get to go sooner because of the pandemic.
