This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Mule Creek.</br></br>

COVID has turned many men's sentences from a five, 10, or 20 year term into a instant death sentence. No judge, nor jury, no trial. Just death row for men who otherwise would be finished paying their debt to society in months or years. Or in [redacted] case, already paid.</br></br> 

Only to be condemned by a courtroom full of microscopic executioners. Being in prison through this pandemic has given me worse anxiety, hopelessness, and PTSD, than any act of violence I ever experienced on the street, or in my 20 years as a gangster.</br></br>

The scariest part is that the people charged with keeping me safe from this invisible death just don't care. [Redacted], left me with a truly dark outlook on how cruel the world can be, but he’s also my inspiration to live and love everyone closest to you. So genuinely and completely every single day, because tomorrow is not promised.</br></br> 

I now spend every waking hour working to become free again, and in the fastest time humanly possible, because I’m afraid of facing another year like we just had.</br></br>

In a place where my life is only viewed as a prison number and patient file. Life is too short, spending loving every human being you come in contact with, because they may very well be the last person you share a moment of gift of life with. Rest in peace [redacted] 2021.
