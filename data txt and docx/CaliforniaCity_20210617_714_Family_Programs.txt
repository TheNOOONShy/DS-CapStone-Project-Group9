This story was told by a person incarcerated at California City.</br></br>

UCI: I see. And how has the COVID situation at your facility affected your loved ones?</br></br>

Caller: Oh, man, they just [unintelligible]. Actually, I had one person that almost passed away. And it's just hard, you know? It's hard when you really can't see - well, actually had some visits away for a while. They're just barely getting back to us. But, yeah, it was hard, not being able to see us.</br></br>

And that's what I'm saying. They were supposed to give us those tablets, but I guess they never, they never came through. Now they're just letting us visit, but it's been like a little struggle. Not like that but just missing, you know? Missing your family and loved ones. All stressful. It's all stressful, and you're just in your cell all day. You can't even come out.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, I understand-</br></br>

Caller: I mean, they're trying to open it up a little bit.</br></br>

UCI: You said they're starting to open it up a little bit?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah. We come out for, like, an hour or two sometimes. They let us out. We take turns.
