This story was told by a person incarcerated at New Folsom.</br></br>

Caller: So basically, the whole safety and procedures, these memos they sent out to us about safety precautions and all this crazy kind of stuff, they don’t care about it. They pass out the paperwork, but the COs are not pushing these issues to make sure that everybody is sanitized, clean, and taking the steps. So, and with the, what is that, the new delta virus, which also indicates that you can be fully vaccinated but you can still catch the virus and may not get sick or anything but still pass it on to other people.</br></br> 

And when you go outside, most of the yard officers nobody is wearing masks. Going through the little rotunda to go to medical, you know, these people are not wearing masks and this and that.</br></br>

And then come to find out that the warden is signing numerous medical, religious, medical religious passes for our COs not to be vaccinated for religious belief and medical relief. Even though one of the COs was working over in medical when I went and was talking about this and was telling the other CO about it in front of me.</br></br> 

Okay, this guy was saying that he caught COVID, but he's not going to take the vaccine and he feels that he’s, I forget the word for it, that he can’t catch COVID because he already had it, that he’s not taking other people’s safety into consideration because the men didn’t wear masks. The man is standing right in front of me, putting on handcuffs and stuff, and you know, what about my safety?</br></br>

So you’ve got all of these COs running around here that are unvaccinated, that are not taking the protocol and the safety procedures and stuff and caring about everybody. Not only, not just the inmates, but what about the coworkers? So as far as all the safety protocols and everything that they’re putting out, it’s not what it seems.</br></br> 

Everything is basically totally different from what they’re putting out to be. So, the safety procedures is not there.
