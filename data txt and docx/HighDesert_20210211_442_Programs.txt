B yard staff are strategically depriving inmates of phone calls, showers, disinfectant, dayroom, canteen. The strategy is to give a few inmates (randomly) these rights for a small amount of minutes every two to three days. Therefore keeping staff in the clear by staying within their operation guidelines. This sneaky strategy is a form of cruel and unusual punishment and manipulation of rigging the system.</br></br>


Also the number of things that delay our program on day to day operations have grown and another opportunity for staff to abuse and manipulate. On these days, that program is delayed. I’ve witnessed staff relaxing in their offices on their cell phones or having large gatherings, eating and drinking, paid to party meanwhile inmates confined to their cells trying to cope with this indignation, has become a normal way of life.</br></br>


This is criminal.</br></br>
