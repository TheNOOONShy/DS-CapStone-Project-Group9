I began my journey to cope way before the COVID-19 pandemic, way before any panel ordered a state prison population reduction. Way before I had any hope of getting out of prison, I was actively involved with mental health and inmate participation program groups. I’d not only participate in these programs but I’d also become a certified facilitator.</br></br> Groups like anger management, domestic violence, parenting, celebrate recovery, release and re-entry... just to name a few, helped to give me the courage to productively progress through the uncertainty of incarceration.</br></br> Lastly, I cope with this crisis by my faith. Since that first day I was removed from all that I’d known to be my norm, my God has allowed me the grace to get through. Daily I read my Bible and repeat of any and all that I’ve done to get here. Also, I thank God for His constant love and care for me till today. He continues to do so.</br></br>
