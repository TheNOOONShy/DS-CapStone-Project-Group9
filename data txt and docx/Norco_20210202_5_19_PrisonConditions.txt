This story was told by a person incarcerated at Norco.</br></br>Caller: Okay yeah so, they do pass out, they do pass out masks now every couple weeks. But the problem with that is, for example, the last- matter of fact we should be getting masks tonight. But two weeks ago when we received masks, the officer who brought them to us, he handed them out and he didn’t have on gloves.</br></br>UCI: Mmm.</br></br>Caller: He just brought them over, I don’t know where he came from, but he handed them to the officer in my building and neither one of them had gloves. And so we were, you know, now so now we’re using masks that are possibly contaminated already from the jump, you know. And right after that, that’s when we had another outbreak.</br></br>
You know so, we all we do get temperature checks now just about every day. We get tested now. We get tested and actually testing us every- so they tested us on Friday and we tested again yesterday on Tuesday.</br></br>
Since the outbreak, we’ve been testing like twice a week. I was told after I contracted the virus, to the dorm I’m in now, is that the recovery dorm and it’s not a recovery dorm. And so, gosh, you know, honestly, they’re just really shuffling us around.</br></br>UCI: Mhmm.</br></br>Caller: And um that’s really what they’re doing.
