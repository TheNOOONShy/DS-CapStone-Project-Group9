This story is told by a person incarcerated at Corcoran.</br></br>Caller: It sucks, man. Hey, it sucks to be in here and to be helpless, man, and be at the mercy of other people. Let me tell you something that I think don't make no sense.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>

Caller: These employees that come in here, they test them for coronavirus and they still let them come into work before the test comes back.</br></br>

Now they got the what you call it test, you know, do it right on the spot, but before they came out with that they test them every week, swab their nose, but they still let them come in until the results. Before they came out with that new testing that they have, before it took, like, seven days to 10 days to get the results back, and they were still coming in and working, man. You know what I mean?</br></br>

Then, when the results come back then they say, "Oh, okay, you can't come on grounds, you have to go home and quarantine." But, they already came in and, you know, passed the seed around to everybody, you know. All right, have you been infected?</br></br>

UCI: I have not, fortunately.</br></br>

Caller: All right, man, you stay - I'm glad for you, man. You stay safe, man, all right.
