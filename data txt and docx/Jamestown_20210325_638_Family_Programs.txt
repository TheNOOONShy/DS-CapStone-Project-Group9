Staff is not efficiently allowing us access to phone sign ups and/or to the phones when you’re on the phone access roster. Half of the privileged inmates are not getting their one phone call per day.</br></br>

Let alone two or more as consistent across state institutions operating within the designated programming incentive criteria. Further hampering our immediate family ties as well as our mental and physical well being.</br></br>

The population, as well as myself, are aware of the potential safety and security risk posed by enforcing the DMS while understaffed. We don’t expect staff nor the population's safety to be compromised by such insufficient and reckless management of institutional operations.</br></br>

But in light of restorative justice, other factors should be considered and implemented ensuring a safe and efficient environment, for not just staff and society, but the inmate population too.</br></br> 

As quoted from Supreme Court Justice Ms. Sotomayor, “society is measured by how they treat their prisoners.” A reasonable compromise, which doesn’t compromise the safety of society, is to continue to run phones and incentive programs. Such as canteen and packages regardless of the amount of custody staff.</br></br> 

If for nothing else to keep in tact and promote good conduct while maintaining humanity, self-worth, and healthy immediate ties.</br></br> 
 
It’s 11:45 am on Monday, March 15, 2021. School, medical, and other essential assignments are being performed by the inmate population. But phones are empty, canteen continues to not be ran, whether bag and drag or window shopping. And despite R and R staff ensuring packages would be ran today after not doing them yesterday, no packages or yard is being ran.</br></br>  

Nor has it been ran consistent with the DMS since amendments to these officers' employment contracts.
