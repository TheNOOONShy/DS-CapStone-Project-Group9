This story was told by a person incarcerated at Santa Clara Main Jail.</br></br>

You know, the officers don’t be wearing gloves, and then when we do have an outbreak; when we do have an outbreak in the pods they don’t put up notice for everybody to try to– to try to, try to– let us know to start you know, taking precautions.</br></br>

So, some of us; thank God they upgraded the cleaning spray. You know, to where it seems like it’s effective. One of the inmates, they did some construction work right? And they tore up the bathrooms, put in new towel, they power washed the floors during COVID.</br></br>

I was like, “Damn man, they doing us hella dirty.” I’ve been doing time in [unintelligible], California, and Elmwood DOC for 16 years, year round, and only have five months out of those 16 years of free. And that five months was sporadic.</br></br>

So, I pretty much did a life sentence back here.
