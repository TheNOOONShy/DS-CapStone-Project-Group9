This letter was written by a person incarcerated at High Desert.</br></br>

Wow. Receiving this letter from you is like you heard my cries. A couple of days before receiving your letter I was filled with so much indignation and I wanted to tell someone so bad what we go through in here. It’s very rare that the things we complain about in here makes it past the gates. A majority of grievances get denied and die as quick as they started.</br></br>

I’ve been in prison 17 years, things have changed a lot over the years but there’s still things that haven’t changed a bit. And those things that haven’t changed is what made this pandemic Hell on Earth. I’ve never feared for my life in prison the way I have during this pandemic. And I’ve been on yards where there are stabbings and killings daily.</br></br>

At the beginning of this I said if COVID makes it to this prison I’m going to get it and that came to be true. And watching it all unfold in real time right in front of me until the virus made it to me was the worst. The mistakes that prison were making before my eyes were unsettling. Us inmates were making mistakes also but leadership was setting all the examples.</br></br>

And what makes things bad is you see the director on T.V. and hear him giving you all these promises that took months to see and some we are still waiting on. The two biggest lies “we are doing all in our power to keep you safe and communicate with you,” and we are finding ways to give you more connection with family and loved ones.</br></br>

I’ve never felt more alone in prison than now.</br></br>

We have to create a disturbance to get what we are required to have. I really don’t know where to begin but I’ll give you a couple situations I’ve been in.</br></br>

Before the corona, the attitude with C.O.s is they give us as less as possible, especially this yard. The C.O.s call this the piece of shit yard. So imagine if we were getting next to nothing before the virus, imagine now. Before they would find ways not to run program, program meaning open up yard, dayroom, phones, showers, time out the cell.</br></br>

Now they don’t have to find ways. They blame everything on testing or COVID related, short of staff. I went from talking to my family once or twice a day to once a week if I’m lucky.</br></br> 

I haven’t been to store in a month. We had to create a protest to get to store. We had to protest to get phones and when we do that they don’t like it so then they find legal ways to fuck us. Or they’ll run phones for a small group for 30 minutes and shut ‘em off for the rest of the day. And in the books it will say they ran the phones.</br></br>

So not too long ago COVID hit the yard. My building someone had it. They quarantined the whole building and I thought that was that. We quarantine for two weeks and it will be over. But everything they did after that is what led to the whole prison catching COVID.</br></br>

So they came around to test us all and before getting the test back, they had inmates passing out food (the C.O.s were supposed to during quarantine). Then they get results back and the inmates that were passing out food with no mask on tested positive, and a bunch others. And for some reason all the inmates that tested positive were moved to another yard with another inmate population.</br></br>

Then they tested us all again and before they got results back they moved around 30 inmates to a yard where they weren’t on quarantine, then they got results back and they were all positive spreading corona. Then for the next 2 months they shuffled inmates around, spreading corona through the prison.</br></br>

Meanwhile, medical and C.O.s kept us in the dark whenever I asked what was going on medical and C.O.s made it seem as if they had a secret. Basically I couldn’t get info from either group.</br></br>

I wasn’t told I had corona until 3 weeks after the fact, and when I told the Dr. I still had symptoms, she told me to drink plenty of water, and I had to demand my own follow-up. For a month the C.O.s were making our food trays because finally all inmates were quarantined. The food was slapped on thin paper trays and all mixed together. For more than a month, food was cold and wet and when I filed a complaint, I was told the food temp was checked and it was up to standards.</br></br>

It’s been horrible, they will move two sick inmates out of a cell and turn around and put two healthy inmates in that same cell. Medical knew this was going on and said nothing to the C.O.s. The C.O.s blame medical and medical blames C.O.s and we are the victims. Animals. Worse. I used to treat my dog better than they treat me.</br></br>

For 17 years instead of healing, prison culture keeps that anger and hate in you. And now I’m getting out next year more fucked up then when I came in at age 21. I was a young boy looking for change, instead I got abused mentally, physically, and emotionally.</br></br>

High Desert State Prison. (B-yard)</br></br>

B yard staff are strategically depriving inmates of phone calls, showers, disinfectant, dayroom, canteen. The strategy is to give a few inmates (randomly) these rights for a small amount of minutes every two to three days. Therefore keeping staff in the clear by staying within their operation guidelines. This sneaky strategy is a form of cruel and unusual punishment and manipulation of rigging the system.</br></br>

Also the number of things that delay our program on day to day operations have grown and another opportunity for staff to abuse and manipulate. On these days, that program is delayed. I’ve witnessed staff relaxing in their offices on their cell phones or having large gatherings, eating and drinking, paid to party meanwhile inmates confined to their cells trying to cope with this indignation, has become a normal way of life.</br></br>

This is criminal.</br></br>

Please help us.</br></br>

What do you do when you’re in prison and you believe that everything about prison is making you a worse person? Is it natural to fear the prison system and prison guards? If I’m suffering from trauma and the trauma I’m suffering from is caused by things that are unjust in prison, what do I do?</br></br>

My whole life I’ve been coping with the unjust day to day struggles prison has to offer, but lately the unjust I’ve been coping with is starting to take its toll mentally and physically. I’m getting out soon and the realization of me being in the free world scares me. For the last 17 years of my life, I’ve trained my brain to sweep anything that bothers me under the rug, along with bottled-up anger.</br></br>

The prison I was raised in is not the prison they try to paint for you now. I can’t go more than two days without being flooded with anger. The mind games that the C.O.s and this system hand us is cruel and meant for one thing: to break us. And the ones who benefit from that is prison system and COs.</br></br>

The first thing you learn in prison is medical and C.O.s don’t care about you or your life. For someone who had a fucked up childhood and no guidance, I had a little hope for prison but I was fooled for thinking the prison system cared. In a way I was betrayed, I was tricked. I thought I could move forward and pass my mistakes and make a real change in my life.</br></br>

Instead, I was treated like I committed a new crime everyday. 17 years and I’m still treated like I was sentenced yesterday. For the C.O.s, you living in a cage and eating slop is not enough. Somehow they have the job to punish us everyday reminding us, not letting us move past our mistakes. How can one learn from his mistakes if he isn’t allowed to move away from them?</br></br>

Now in the days I’m supposed to be in regret or feeling remorseful, instead of ridding myself of hate, I’m holding onto it. I know I could be mistaken for a stupid person for all the mistakes I’ve made. But I know the everyday anger, hate, and frustration I live with because the injustices I see and live in is not safe, is not normal.</br></br>

I’m getting out soon, I shouldn’t feel broken, defeated. I shouldn’t have anger. After 17 years, I shouldn’t still be doing drugs to cope with childhood traumas and now adulthood traumas. I haven’t been diagnosed with PTSD but I know I have it. Just in prison I’ve felt scared, close to death, threatened, verbal abuse, physical abuse. I want to learn more about addiction, trauma, rehabilitation, but prison isn’t the place. Prison is where you experience traumas, threats, unsafe lifestyle practices.</br></br>

A lot of people in prison come from dysfunctional families or harsh environments and suffer from a number of traumatic events from childhood and adulthood. Many of us suffer from PTSD and are totally unaware of it or don’t realize how we cope with it in unhealthy ways.</br></br>

This along with a number of issues puts us at a disadvantage or completely disabled. Therefore making the smallest responsibilities impossible, let alone being a productive member of society . So the bait is before prison, and prison is the trap. Us unlucky, undeveloped minds (youth) who were totally unaware that a majority of our behavior stemmed from trauma we were coping with.</br></br>

We were tossed in a hate-filled, racial segregated, broken, corrupt prison system. A lot of us come to prison in need of real help.</br></br>

I myself came to prison with hopes of change. But there was none around me. I tried on my own but the lack of educational opportunity, the lack of rehabilitative reentry opportunity was out of reach. I soon gave in and fell in line with other seeds planted in CDCR soil. It’s easier to get a hold of an unhealthy, unsafe coping mechanism to your psychological issues than it is to obtain a safe, educational one.</br></br>

A lot of us are unaware that the drug use or acts of violence are ways we cope with the trauma we inherit in the ghettos and prison. To add to the laundry list of issues and disabilities, CDCR programs, plants, and grows hate, frustration, indignation, hopelessness into us broke men.</br></br>

The picture prison paints for people outside is we are giving opportunities for rehabilitation, but the truth is prisons have an unspoken, unwritten agreement to activate violence, distress, and confusion into the hearts of its inmates.</br></br>


In doing so secures CDCR officers long term profit, riding on the backs of our mental health. The game prison plays night and day fills us broken men with rage, frustration, and helplessness. At times I feel like a dog tied out of reach from rehabilitation.</br></br>

Is it normal for a man to have so much hate and anger? But the C.O.s antagonistic demeanor and pain operations fuel and generates so much hate. I know deep to the bone prison has a major role in me developing psychological issues to add to my already existing trauma.</br></br>

Because of prison, I don’t think I can ever truly be normal.</br></br>

The poison of our minds and the destruction of our well-being starts with our surroundings. We as humans adapt and pick up what’s around us for survival. When our brains are not fully developed and warped from the streets.</br></br>

The influence we receive in prison can determine our future mind state. So wake up, pay attention to what’s going on around you. Not only have you lost your freedom. They’re after your mind.</br></br>

Everyday they take a piece of it until you no longer have a purpose. You think you’re just doing your time. Remember you’re living and you’re in a war. Everyday the system attacks you, and you don’t attack back, you’re losing the war.</br></br>

Every time your anger is aroused by something unjust that’s an attack on your mind. You have to hit back. Little by little, they are breaking you down.  Everyday you don’t feed your mind, they are winning. You’re on autopilot, you’re not institutionalized, you’re asleep.</br></br>

Wake and see what’s going on around you!
