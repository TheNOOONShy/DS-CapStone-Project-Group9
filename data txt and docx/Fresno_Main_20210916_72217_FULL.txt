This story was told by a person incarcerated at Fresno County Jail.</br></br> 

Caller: Okay, so the update is we're still in quarantine. No visits. No court. No anything. Emotions are high. We're very concerned.</br></br> 

We did a swab test two days ago, and according to the physician here, it's called the - the charge nurse, that's the MCO I think, Medical Chief of whatever, that's the equivalent; we might get off in three days. However, if somebody comes out positive, we're going to stay in quarantine and deal with it as accordingly.</br></br>

But it's just no - no more court. We haven't had court since what? Three weeks, so close to a month. So our rights have been kind of - and there's no due process.</br></br> 

That's what concerns us. Who do we talk to? Who do we turn to? Due process, you know? Who do we ask and say hey, you know? If we get arrested, we're supposed to be within court in three days, you know? I mean, all those rights are taken from us.</br></br>

And my concern is, why is - why is - is she anticipating like massive death or, you know, the end of the world or something? Because she wants to record these things for what civilization, for - I mean? Is there like anticipation something severe is gonna happen to humankind, you know? That's my question.</br></br>

UCI: Oh, we want to gather stories so people can know what it's like for you guys. We understand that it's very difficult and is very different. We want to archive these stories for the public to hear.</br></br>

Caller: So, you want to archive them not for a future like race? Just, you know, just what - archive, just to me, seems kind of like, you know, preserving our story, human story, you know? Just kind of scary, you know, because we have this other wave coming supposedly.</br></br> 

Well, I'm not saying supposedly. It's supposed to come, the Delta? Whatever you call that. But we're still concerned about the - the pandemic, this - this coronavirus because we don't - we don't - nobody seems to has - have it here. We do temperature checks every day.</br></br> 

And - and it's just really, really overwhelming because we're all in fear. But, you know, men like us, you know, bad boys, we show our fear in different ways. And - and we don't really express it in healthy, and - and there's no one here to teach us to express, you know, healthy, healthy emotions. So it's like we're all trying to, you know?</br></br>

There's 40, okay - our pod is about the size of a Starbucks, so - and there's 48 of us in here. So, imagine being in a Starbucks with 48 people. You know, trying to move around, trying to be happy, trying to make light of the situation. And for the most part, we are happy.</br></br>

I mean, you know, we're not fighting. We don't - we - some of us, you know, like to read scriptures or, you know, give quote, unquote, quotes, you know, they've read before. And it's all encouraging. So, it's like a transition.</br></br> 

This pandemic, in one sense, has destroyed the lives of a lot of people, but in a deeper sense, it's brought us humans together. I've seen that. And we've overcoming a lot of boundaries that we had before.</br></br> 

So, you know, all of us want to become human beings now - better human beings. That's what it seems. That's our main goal because we don't know when our mother is gonna die or our father, our cousin, our - we just don't know.</br></br>

So, it's like death has opened our eyes to a different, new reality, and it's a more peaceful reality per se. So, that's - that's encouraging. That's - that's good news.</br></br> 

And perhaps that's what it takes, you know, to become better human beings. I'm not sure. But you know life always it has its wildcards. So, do you have any questions, yourself? What would you like to know about, you know, us?</br></br>

Some of us are in here for murder. Not me, you know. But some of us are in here for murder, so it's very stressful, you know? Some of us are attempted murder. capital crimes, you know? And it's very stressful for them.</br></br>

There's no family members that we can see, you know come see and visit. So, there's gotta be an avenue, you know? A vehicle for us to - you know, at least express some kind of feelings towards the outside world, you know, instead of just being bottled up in this little cage here. And, you know, it just feels like no one's really caring about, you know, us because of our history of crimes and being bad boys.</br></br> 

I just want to say it like that, because for lack of better words. I don't want to say anything harsher than that because all of us do have love in our hearts. We do have families that we love and care, so we're not, like, incapable of kindness.</br></br>

That's what we need most of all, I think, in institutions. I have 26 years' experience in and out of prisons and institutions from Pelican Bay to San Quentin to about 20 different prisons. So, I'm speaking from experience, okay.</br></br>

And I don't mind giving my name because I don't like talking without someone knowing at least who - if I die, I want to know who they heard. But I'm 50 percent Scottish and I'm 50 percent Latin. And that's just what I want, you know, people to know because it's something, who I am. It identifies me as a person.</br></br>

This non-like, anonymous thing, it might be for some, but not for all of us. We want to know - we want people to know, you know, if - who we are, you know? This is my way of giving back to the community, okay? Because, we don't have - we don't have different ways of doing so, you know?</br></br>

And prison and jails don't provide us, you know, avenues to give back to our community. And that, for the most part, is what we need. We need kindness.</br></br> 

We need to learn kindness. We need - we learn how to be kindhearted, and that's what is going to help us grow as humans and overcome our obstacles, you know? And environmental influence absolutely plays a part in our transitions into criminals, being criminals, you know?</br></br> 

Because there's different cultures all over the world, and the more selfish and unkind a culture is, the more likely they are to become criminals. And this is - as I said, I'm speaking from experience. I turned into a criminal at the age of 14.</br></br>

But I don't want to get off the pandemic thing, so - but it has to do with - it's all entwined, though. And this is very encouraging that you, your professor. Anyway, it doesn't matter. I'm just saying thank you. Whoever that is.</br></br>

I appreciate taking the time to write a beautiful note. It's very encouraging. And so, do you have any questions that you might want to know or any interests that your fellow classmates might have, you know? Questions you might be pondering and would like to know about our environment, our conditions, our mental health?</br></br>

I mean, 'cause we're in a psych tank too. This is where they take - bring the people with medications who take psych medications. Not all of us are here because there's actually thousands that actually take medications, but there's 45 of us that are in this tank. So, it's bedlam.</br></br> 

You know, it's always like this psychiatric uproar, you know? Something's always happening. And - but, you know, nothing that we can't overcome. Just - just people emotionally overwhelmed, and they express it differently.</br></br>

So, yeah. So, we're locked down. We haven't stepped out of this cell since, what is it? Almost a month we've just been in here. Just caged in. And we're strong men, though, you know?</br></br> 

Not everybody can do that, you know? Stay in a Starbucks for a month, you know? It's just like, you know? Are you okay?</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, yes. I, first of all, want to thank you so much for sharing all of that. It means a lot to us. And I completely agree with you.</br></br> 

Kindness is super important, especially now during this pandemic. Kindness is so important, and it's so important that we show it to everybody.</br></br>

Caller: Yes. Yes, it is. It is very important. Some people don't even consider it as something that humans need, or helps us grow, you know? But it - I think it's the ultimate source of life.</br></br> 

Love. Love is my guide, you know? I follow love wherever it takes me. Everything I do, I say, "What would love do?" That's my question. Would love do this? Would love do that? You know?</br></br>

My issue is that I do, do evading. I do grand theft auto, you know? I'm bad in a lot of ways. It's - it's not - I'm on medication, you know?</br></br>

When I stop taking my medication, I transition back into a bad boy, you know? But when I'm on my meds, I mean, I'm great.</br></br> 

I care about the community. I mean I give - I give, you know, time and respect and go to soup kitchens and help, you know, help feed. You know, I do things that are good, but just somehow when I - I don't want to be mentally ill. You understand?</br></br>

So, it's like, I say maybe if I stop my medications, I can prove it this time that I'm not mentally ill, and I can do the things I do wholeheartedly without, you know, dependent on some kind of psychiatric medication, psychotropic. So, it's like I do that then, then I don't see the transitions back to not caring, being selfish, being unkind, and stealing.</br></br> 

You see, there's a transition there that I don't - there's no triggers that I, "Oh, okay I'm doing something wrong. I need to get back on my medication." It's just one night I fall asleep, and the next night I'm in a high-speed chase. You know what I'm saying?</br></br>

So, it's like medication is very important for people out in the community to take and make sure there's some kind of support system. Because if there's no support system, and some one's there, you know? No one's there to help, you know, somebody with their medication and their issues, they're more likely to commit some kind of crime, to put themselves in jail.</br></br>

'Cause there's some of these people in here that don't need to be in here. They're just mentally ill. They talk to themselves. They're walking around in circles. And they have no clue where they are or what kind of - what kind of environment they're in.</br></br> 

They don't realize that they can get back. They don't realize that, you know, they don't realize anything other than their mental illness. They just exist. I call them the existers. They just - they just exist. You know what I mean? And without any kind of - it's sad, you know?</br></br>

Because we are a primitive society in terms of the psychiatric community. You know, the psychiatric community thinks they're really advanced, and they're not.</br></br> 

You know when somebody goes into a psych - psychosis, becomes, you know, self-mutiliated, you know? They're self-mutilating themselves. They handcuff the person and they put them in a cage. A cage. Handcuffed. I mean, this is primitive.</br></br> 

This is caveman's freakin' thinking. You don't do that to somebody who's a patient. You want to give 'em love. You want to give 'em kindness. You want to give 'em warmth, you know?</br></br>

Then here comes a psychiatrist bitching and yelling that you're causing a disturbance. And then you - 'cause we're used to being mistreated. I've been mistreated all my life. You know, bring it on, I mean.</br></br> 

I mean, mistreat me all you want, it's just something I'm used to. Most of us in here are mistreated, been mistreated.</br></br>

So, our way of dealing with that is we react in ways that are unconventional. We just - just, we act out, you know? Become bad boys, you know? And that's not good. That's not good for us. That's not good for our families or the community.</br></br>

But it's a pain. Pain that draws us into our psychosis, you know? It's loneliness. It's emptiness. It's a sense of failure.</br></br>

I mean, because when you're in jail, you don't have a way to give back. And I think, for the most part, institutions have to find a way for us to give back. I wrote letters to the captain asking them if we could wash wheelchairs and - and -and handicap implements for people that are in the hospital, the hospital is right down the street.</br></br> 

You know, we can bring 'em here and clean them and disinfect them, you know, for the community. You know, something even that small, even - even if we can help in the tiniest ways, helps us mentally in the highest ways, you know? And I tried to express that, but I got no word back. I mean, it's like, who cares, you know?</br></br>

So it's like, you know, it's frustrating. Because you know what, I mean, when we're on our last leg and we feel that we might die of - of this COVID, we do want to love. That's the end goal is to love somebody. Love something. You understand what I mean?</br></br> 

That's like each man's death wish is to love and be loved at - at his end, you know? And - and we don't know. We don't know if it's gonna happen or not to us. We're waiting for the results.</br></br>

And we call it the invisible enemy, you know? We don't - anyways, it's your turn now. I want you to talk and.</br></br>

UCI: I - I completely agree with you. Everything. I agree with you. Love, support, kindness. It is so important that we show it to everybody.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, yeah. If you don't have it, you're gonna become selfish, and selfishness, looking out for number one, is - is primitive. It's a caveman's priority, you know?</br></br>

It's - don't - don't ever have your kids do it, don't do it yourself. I mean, just always look out for somebody who's in need.</br></br> 

Oh, I wanted to ask you. You know what? I'm gonna have to call you back, though. I'll call you back because I -</br></br>

UCI: Of course. Of course.</br></br>

Caller: I - I need the number - we need the number for that pen-pal thing from UCLA School of Law. Somebody gave it to us before, but they gave it to us wrong, and - and the letters came back. 

UCI: Okay, okay. Let me -</br></br>

Caller: I'll - I'll call back later and talk to you. Okay? So-</br></br>

UCI: Okay, thank you so much for sharing. Thank you for sharing your story.</br></br>

Caller: Okay, bye.
