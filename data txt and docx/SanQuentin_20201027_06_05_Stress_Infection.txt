This story was told by a staff member at San Quentin.</br></br>

UCI: What has it been like for you, having to cope with this crisis? When you were at the prison, and now that, now that you are no longer working there?</br></br>

Caller: It was so, not only just, you know, incredibly stressful, so it was very stressful to [unintelligible]. I did and because oftentimes I’d have to be in a room alone with an inmate with the door shut. And, you know, the mask situation did not come about until, I think, late June, early July. That’s when mandatory masks were a policy, although it wasn’t enforced. So not only was the patient terrified that they were going to get COVID from me, somebody who goes in and out of the prison, but I was terrified that I was with a patient who had not yet been tested, because in the beginning, there wasn’t any testing.</br></br> 

We’re talking about in June, all of June. So there was limited testing that was afforded to San Quentin, for whatever reason, and when patients came down with COVID-like symptoms, they were first being tested for the flu. And we know that the flu tests are not 100 percent. So if they - there’s a lot of false positives. So when they were tested for the flu, if they tested positive for the flu, they would not be, it would not be followed up with a test for COVID, and they would be sent back to the unit.</br></br> 

So if indeed, this person, in June, was infected with COVID, they were going back to the crowded housing units, without adequate ventilation, without adequate sanitation, without hand sanitizer. And they prevented hand sanitizer from being distributed because it had alcohol in it, and they didn’t want inmates to make pruno or drink it. And they were sending these inmates back to mingle with the general population, to sleep in a cell with a, you know, a possible non-COVID-infected inmate, and go to classes, or you know, do whatever they needed to do, just move around the prison.
