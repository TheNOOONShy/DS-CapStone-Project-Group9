This story was told by a person incarcerated at Chuckawalla.</br></br>

UCI:  Would it be possible for you to kind of give me like a breakdown sort of like month to month to see how the situation has progressed at your facility?</br></br>Caller: Well, you know, it seems like now every week we're getting put on quarantine. You know, now that the wardens in Sacramento have finally just stepped up and, you know, took reins of the situation, it seems like now every month is a quarantine. You know, now they're testing more. You know, and, you know, since some higher ups pretty much got, you know, got on them about doing what they're supposed to be doing, now they trying to play ten-hut-one-two right now.</br></br>You know, but back then, you know, they were just trying to move everybody from different yards and different institutions and everything. You know, so now all of a sudden when you got Sacramento involved, now everybody has to, you know, toe the line.</br></br>UCI: I see. So, it's like what you were saying earlier about how they're kind of just doing it to look good or whatever?</br></br>Caller: Yes, yes. I mean but when you making a lot of money like this and you know your job could potentially be on the line for you not doing your job.</br></br>When your bosses step up, guess what you going to do? You're going to make it look like you're doing your job.</br></br>UCI: Yeah, yeah. That makes sense.</br></br>Caller: Yeah, you know, I'm a realist. I've seen it over and over again.
