This story was told by a family member of someone incarcerated at Centinela.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah. Thank you so much. Is there anything else you would like to share about you or how it's affecting you? I know it's your loved one.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah it is my loved one and it's just super stressful, the fact that you're not getting what you need to eat. I mean, he's- hold on, sorry I thought I heard my daughter crying.</br></br>

UCI: No worries.</br></br>

Caller: He's lucky enough to be able to have money on his books to be able to eat but they're keeping their store from them. They're not allowing them to go to store. So just the constant stressing of, "Oh my god he's not eating," "Oh my god he has COVID." It's just- it's been very very very stressful.</br></br>

And the fact of how they're just releasing people back into other sections of the prison and who knows if they don't have COVID? I mean these C.O.s are walking around positive with no masks and yelling at inmates to wear their masks, but theyâ€™re not following protocol either.</br></br>

So I think- it's been super super stressful and we went a long time without him catching it, but it's just the lack of care for the C.O.s because at the end of the day they really don't care about the inmates. I mean they are people too, no matter who, you know, what their crime, what they're in there for. So, it's just a sad situation.
