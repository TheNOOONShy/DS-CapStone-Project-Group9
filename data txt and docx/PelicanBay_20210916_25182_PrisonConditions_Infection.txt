This story was told by a person incarcerated at Pelican Bay.</br></br> 

UCI: But you mentioned that sometimes they just shut down your yard time. Do they ever tell you why?</br></br>

Caller: Because the thing is, when they shut the program down, that's when ... Usually, that's when a CO gets sick, you know? So, they, like, they shut only the building with the officer wards. You know? But then, like, two or three days, they end up slamming the whole prison.</br></br>

UCI: Are you all regularly tested?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah. Like, yeah. Well, I haven't taken the vaccine shot yet. So, they come and, yeah, they come and test me every, I'd say like every four days or something like that.</br></br>

UCI: Are they testing the individuals who did get the vaccine?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah. Like, they'll test them every, maybe every 30 days or something like that.</br></br>

UCI: Have you seen a lot of people either getting the vaccine or not getting the vaccine?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, the majority had it. They have it already. It's just, I don't want to take it because I feel fine, you know? There's no reason for me to take it.</br></br> 

So, yeah. You know, I be hearing on the news that some people be blood clots and stuff like that. So, yeah, that's why I don't want to take it.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, absolutely. You're totally entitled to that viewpoint. Have the correctional staff been getting the vaccine?</br></br>

Caller: Some of them, yeah. Not all of them.</br></br>

UCI: And are they still requiring everyone to wear masks?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah. Yeah, that's mandatory, right there. Yeah, if we don't wear one, they'll give us a write up, you know?</br></br>

UCI: Oh, they will? And what happens when they give you a write up?</br></br>

Caller: Well, usually, they'll take our privileges away, like TV or phone time. Or 30-day yard or canteen, you know? Stuff like that.</br></br>

UCI: So, have you noticed, then, because they'll give you a write up if you don't wear your mask, that there's a lot of people wearing masks?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah. Yeah.
