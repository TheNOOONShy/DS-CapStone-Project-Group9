This letter was written by someone incarcerated in Valley State.</br></br>

Since the pandemic we have been short of things we are suppose to have (yard, dayroom, visitations). I haven't seen my family in months. I barely can call home to them because sometimes we don't have program running.</br></br>

It's bad that we can't come out of our cell, it hurts even more when we can't call our folks. It's hard to get visits going on right now. And when we do call home, we only get 10 minutes to talk to them.</br></br>

We all feel like we should get at least 30 minutes to talk to our people. The only thing good, is we get two free calls a month. Thank you for being an ear and listening to our problems as well. I pray you have a blessed day and stay safe.
