Hello, I received your letter from the PrisonPandemic Project. I do not receive much mail so I decided to contact you, just to answer some of your questions and so. You can also write back to me if you would like.</br></br>

Well, let me start by telling you that this whole Coronavirus situation has been terrible for the past year in custody. It started last March when the facility decided to shut down our visits. Being here in custody without being able to see your loved ones has been a real struggle.</br></br>

You see, when you’re behind bars most of the time, it is only your family you’ve got. Somehow, for some strange reason, who you thought were your friends somehow disappear on you, even though my mother warned me. Especially when you have three small children under 10 years old like I do. But I have had to stay strong. It is very hard but I do it.</br></br>

As far as the virus itself, different people are affected differently. I’ve seen some in here that have had the virus and no effect at all, as if they didn’t know. Others I have seen near death. Personally I caught it two different times along with a handful of other inmates. I, however, am still coping with ringing in my ears, shortness of breath, and lingering headaches.</br></br>

When I first got it, I went to see a nurse and am currently being treated for any of my complaints, even as I stay awake at night not being able to breathe. Vaccines were available for a while, but I’ve only know one person who got one.</br></br>

If you have any more questions or you want to write back, feel free.</br></br>

Respectfully,
