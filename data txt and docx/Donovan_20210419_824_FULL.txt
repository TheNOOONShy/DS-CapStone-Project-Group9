This story was told by a person incarcerated at Donovan.</br></br>

UCI: So how has the COVID situation been like at your facility?</br></br>

Caller: Right so first of all I want to thank you guys. I’ve received one of your letters sent by a college student, am I right? And I highlighted some of the questions which is something similar to what you just asked and first question here is, “What has it been like being inside during this time either at the beginning of the pandemic, middle, or now? How do you feel about your safety inside? What has it been like to have reduced visitation from family, loved ones? How have you been coping with this crisis? How have the vaccinations been going at your facility?”</br></br>
Right. And to share a little bit of my experience right, as far as the beginning, the middle, and now, this stage. In the beginning of the pandemic. It was- it was very difficult and uncertain and that was due to experience the family- my family, loved ones, and situations of those visits cause, as soon as they implemented the COVID around here, they shut everything down. We weren’t getting no contact visits, the program itself as far as payroll, phone calls, your yard time was limited as well.</br></br>

UCI: Ok ok, and so the reduced visitations and programming affected you a lot.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah no doubt, no doubt. I’ve been in- I’ve been in prison myself for 23 years right? But it was just crazy to see, you know the- you know the outside pandemic also take a major affect. Here, within the prison environment right.</br></br>

Another little note cause I- prepped a little bit of- of feedback here to share with you guys. Because they said it’s a research project and it’s feedback and all that, I’m privileged to be part of it. So a second thing I wrote here was initially there was a lot of fear and now because of the way things were being handled, right?</br></br>

Well we saw here and think you might- you probably heard this already from RJ Donovan inmates, the way they were isolating inmates that were coming out positive with COVID-19. They were throwing them all inside, you know being inside the gym facility. And people were mixing and all that, where ever you know they weren’t really being supervised, and thank God I never tested positive but you know, I was within proximity of that gym.</br></br>

And it was strict going down, right. It was coming around, building to building but thankfully by- by the time they got it under control, which was, let’s say like February of this year. They kind of slowed down the vaccinations and the ones coming in as well.</br></br>

UCI: Ok and how has that- how has the vaccination situation been like for you guys?</br></br>

Caller: Right so the- I think I wrote a little bit about that too, here somewhere. Ok so initially it came around- they came around asking or telling the- the priority inmates. Probably like the older inmates, I’m 38 so they were asking what like- 60 and older. People that were like- with mental conditions and all that “Would you like a vaccination?” and I’m going to say like, hypothetically, 10% of them chose to get it.</br></br>

And then after that round of people that got vaccinated right, with the first shot of Pfizer, I’m going to say about like, a month or so later they moved out to the next group of people which was like. I think like 40-50 year olds or whatever or people that have asthma, heart problems and all that kind of stuff. And then on the final stage, that’s where I came in.</br></br>

The remaining people were like- asked if they want to take the vaccination. Not everyone has tooken it and so, you know there’s still the question about- you know. How our contact visits are going to run. And as a matter of fact, today- on this day- the Prison Administration chose to go back down to what’s called “Phase One” and until about two or three positive cases of- of staff- I think it was staff.</br></br>

I’m not sure. It could’ve been inmates and so they- they went back on alert, you can say, right. They- they’re limiting the- the program again. We’re- we can only interact with our own building wherever we’re out.</br></br>

UCI: Ok ok and so how- how do you feel about, say the- the- what is it called? The guards coming in with the, you know, bringing in the COVID or with the-</br></br>

Caller: *talks over* well you know the- you know I got you on- issues, comments. Issues and questions among inmates and you know, people talking and all that, we feel- I feel personally that there should have been more control, in that area right? And obviously we always said here, us inmates, we can- we’re not going- we catch this stuff is by the guards bringing it in. Right, the contaminated cases or whatever they said.</br></br>

So here’s the- the very good example, right? I’m going to say in the beginning- no. Around, November last year? They had what’s called free staff, right. Free staff are like people that do like maintenance work, run factories like a shoe factory- launch-warehouse- whatever.</br></br>

They chose to come in, contaminate it without no- making a proper notification and what happened there is. They chose- they didn’t earn their- their salary and. And as a result, they created a spread, you know what I mean? So one facility, which is CR, got shut down completely because of that. So it wasn’t handled right. It wasn’t being monitored properly.</br></br>

UCI: Ok and you pointing out- pointing out that topic is how- or. What would you do in that situation? What would you implement in the facility to help people incarcerated, lived through this process? If you want to.</br></br>

Caller: Well I mean, the number one answer to something like that is- the way it should have been prevented is they should have completely banned free staff from coming in during the peak time of the pandemic. Or even, for the matter of the entire time of the pandemic.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, definitely. Can you hear me? Hello?</br></br> 

Caller: Hello?</br></br>

UCI: Hello? Can you hear me? Oh yeah I can hear you, you cut off for a bit</br></br>

Caller: Right</br></br>

UCI: I don’t know if you want to continue off or if it cut you off in the middle of the sentence</br></br>

Caller: You know I actually am out of time but I’ll try to call another day as well too. But just, I wanted to touch bases with you guys to let you know that we do appreciate you know, the letters coming by my way and I think a couple other inmates that I talked to have received their letter from the- the University right? Writing about our experience and all that, so really appreciate it.</br></br>

UCI: Of course, we appreciate it as well and if you guys can call another day that also- we appreciate it so, uh</br></br>

Caller; Thank you. Thank you so much. You guys keep up the great work. Hopefully something good comes out of it.</br></br>

UCI: Thank you. Something- something will, I hope. Have a good day.</br></br>

Caller: Alright brother, God bless you. Take care</br></br>
