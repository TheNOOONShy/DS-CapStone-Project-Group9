This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Delano.</br></br>

Taking the precautions in this pandemic has, as information or data received the way I see it was, “live and learn.” But why not, scientist knows the complexity, or this virus so mandate a procedure or guideline ahead of time, to save lives! I believe we that are incarcerated should be informed in a timely manner of updates, procedures and plans not after the fact.</br></br> 

This past year has been hard for me. I was scared of catching this virus and the same fright for anyone I know or family. You can see it in some of these guys were that they were feeling the same. Oh my god! When CDCR cancelled all visits.</br></br> 

Some guys took it hard. Especially when they know their family or loved one had medical conditions.</br></br>

This past year was physically stressful. There’s five(s) housing units here. At one time, for a couple of months, two other units, building 3 and 5 along with 1 has to quarantine. Only 2 and 4 had little movement.</br></br>

Like yard and get to walk to a dining hall for our meals. I, fortunately, has not quarantined. And since all the other guys I work with has quarantined, I had to work seven days. Multi-tasking at work just to feed this facility.</br></br>

Building 1, 3, and 5 since they were quarantined had to be cell fed. After making those trays, push those carts to their unit then go back to serve for building 2 and 4. When all done I had to go get the carts at the buildings.</br></br> 

Wash those trays and the trays from the ones that walked to chow and all pot and pans used and the whole culinary. Do you know how hard and stressful it is to do this since the pandemic started? A few times only myself and another guy would be the only workers.</br></br>

Many times, I wanted not to go to work. But I had too. I didn’t want to get a disciplinary for not showing because I go to Board or Prison Hearing in September 2021 and getting a disciplinary could set me back another year for review.
