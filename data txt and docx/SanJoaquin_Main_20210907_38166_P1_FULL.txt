<em>This story was told by a person incarcerated at San Joaquin County Jail.</br></br></em> 

UCI: Great. Okay. So, tell me about your experience.</br></br>

Caller: Okay. Well, I have a little story I'd like to read to you guys. Of course, I've been reading you guys stories almost every day for the past week or so and this being one of the final ones unless I could finally dig a couple more off the tablet if I get my hands on it because it's been taken from me.</br></br>

UCI: Absolutely.</br></br>

Caller: But I think I might be able to get it back tonight from this one CO. He's pretty cool. I'll explain to him the circumstances and see what I can do.</br></br>

But before I get into this story, I just want to tell you it's like sort of another day of tragedy for me. I had something happen earlier today that just has me a little upset, but I'm working through it.</br></br>

Just to begin the story, it goes back to the last time I was in jail between November-December, and I got out January. While I was in jail, I had a girlfriend at the time that was taking care of my business for me and trying to close up jobs and write checks and keep bills paid and stuff like that. And in doing so, of course, she was in need of using my truck to do it, my work truck, because I perform construction jobs and work on rooftops.</br></br>

So, what I had at the time was a fully-paid-off, it took me two years to pay it off. It was a fully-paid-off $74,000 truck, a big Ram pickup, 2500, extended bed, just big, big truck with all the fixin's. And while I was in jail, with her needing to use the truck, I guess she let a lot of her friends use it too.</br></br>

And one thing led to another, they ran it out of oil, diesel exhaust fluid, and everything else. And they blew up the engine. So, when I got out of jail, I had no means of transportation because I took the truck - I had it towed to the dealership. And they said it required a $29,000 repair. So, the truck was garbage.</br></br>

So, yeah, my friends joke with me often, saying that when I trip and fall, I fall upwards. So, yeah, getting me out of jail, it took me two months of scrounging and renting cars and finding ways to drive to work to keep the bills paid.</br></br>

But after two months, I managed to get to the dealership, and I purchased a brand new $116,000 GMC, same thing, 2500 diesel, big daddy truck. And so, I've had it a couple months now.</br></br>

And when I went to jail here, not only did I lose my house because of being in here just too much and it turns out my girlfriend didn't pay the bills while I was in jail. And so, I [unintelligible] to fill out this COVID thing, saying we only had to pay 25 percent of the rent.</br></br>

And then they evicted us for not paying the full rent on having this big back bill owed. And when I tried to pay it, they refused the money. They said that they just wanted to evict us, and it was a big deal.</br></br>

So, even though I'm in jail now and I've been evicted and I've lost a lot, these ex-boyfriends of my girlfriend that I was in these little battles, little conflicts with, they knew where my mother lives. They went to her house and found my brand new truck sitting there parked in front of her house, and they slashed all the tires. So, I paid $1400 for replacement tires, and insurance only covered a portion of that.</br></br>

And that portion went into my bank account. And it turns out my ex-girlfriend - her previous charges are identity theft and fraud and things like this - she somehow still has access to my account and wiped that out. So, I received nothing. I just paid into the pain, just the $1400 for the tires that I had to buy.</br></br>

And a friend of mine stepped in, one of my partners, and he took the truck. And he got the new tires for it, and he brought it over to his house a county away, you know, a 30-minute drive away, two cities, three cities over.</br></br>

And somehow it took this long. It took them a month and a half or so. They somehow figured out that it would be at his house. I don't know how. I guess they had his number, and they reverse-traced it back to his address.</br></br>

And they wound up over at his house yesterday, and they slashed the tires again. So, I just found that out today. So, I'm a little upset and trying to just work through it and the 1400 bucks I lost.</br></br>

But it is what it is. I'm not going to let it get the better of me. Part of me wants to get out of here and [unintelligible] I was done with this, thinking it was game over for me. I would have no more conflicts with these people.</br></br>

Part of me wants to get out of here and just go find them and make sure their car never drives again, the white Cadillac that was driving by and did it. And I know exactly whose car that is. But whatever. I'm going to leave it alone and just work through it.</br></br>

So, with that being said, I now have this story that I called The Proof I would like to read to you. This is probably the final chapter in what I think has become a book with all these different stories. They're now in chapters with My Story being the first one, Faith in Humanity being the second chapter, and then Why We Love, and then from there possibly The Concept of the Power of the Positive, and then Today, and then finally here The Proof being the final chapter.</br></br>

And there'll be a couple more in there if I can scoop them off my tablet. One's called The Story of Love, and it's just about the way the relationship went between me and my ex-girlfriend. But, okay, here we go with The Proof. I'll read it now.</br></br>

All my life, the better part of me has been more than worthy, filled with decency and the good intentions of pure innocence, as I'm sure it is the same for most of us. But as life carries on through various endeavors, chapters, the challenges one may face can change in many ways. Oftentimes, one can easily be led down the wrong path in our flight to self-gratification. Perhaps with the tests, we are given all sorts of chances to make all sorts of choices, good and bad.</br></br>

Throughout these events in our lives, I know that, for myself, it often made the most sense to display my loyalties to those that mattered to me with the use of brute force and even violence if necessary. And it's within this sort of behavior that it becomes a priority to put one's own self above all others, to even steal when possible just to get ahead, to match brute force with brute force, to fight fire with fire, and so on, anything really to assure that me and my people I care about maintain a progressive movement forward in life while receiving minimal setbacks in the process and all while enforcing a "take no prisoners" frame of mind towards anyone that stands in my way.</br></br>

I was fortunate that, having lived a life in this manner for so long, I never actually brought any harm to anybody along the way. I feel blessed with this, having never found the need to actually strike out in force against any known enemy, because the intentions and willingness were certainly there, although there were a few occasions where I had called upon the thunder and lightning to do my bidding to smite the wicked in defense of innocence.</br></br>

But when this would happen, my adversaries would always quickly change their minds about whatever it was they were up to, and they would instead turn and run for their lives, as I would then allow them to escape with no harm done in hopes that the next time they choose to hurt somebody, they may stop and remember what happened last time when a virtual super hero seemed to materialize out of nowhere, jumping from rooftops, jumping over cars, and running through traffic to get to them.</br></br>

I once chased four men all the way back to their 'hood deep in Oakland, 15 minutes away from where the encounter had started. I had come upon these men punching a woman in the face through her car window. I gave chase as they then called ahead and had over 20 people waiting to ambush me in this narrow alleyway.</br></br>

I'm not sure what they were thinking, really, but they proved no match for my lifted truck as I attempted to run them all down. But, like I said, they moved very quickly, and I allowed them all to escape.</br></br>

With this privilege of being able to defeat my enemies by way of pure willingness and the ability to do so, I have actually never hurt anybody in my life, in a way allowing me to maintain that pure innocence we are all born with free from sin. I do partake in cage fighting, but that is handled in a positive manner where we all willingly agree to have our heads beaten, and it just goes that way. And we do it for the love of the sport.</br></br>

And it's not uncommon to wind up having a beer afterwards with the man you just beat down as he happily tells you that your punches felt like sledge hammers and he'd never been kicked so hard in his life as he appreciates your ability to do so. And we all appreciate having a place where us natural-born warriors could safely indulge our talents.</br></br>

And now with the test of all tests as to who I am and as to who I've become, with this opportunity to fail once again or perhaps finally shine bright like a diamond, recently I have endured some serious tragedies and trespasses upon myself, with my girlfriend having rekindled some relations with her recent boyfriends, which is true to form for her, as I've heard she has always toggled between two relationships at a time of her most recent boyfriends.</br></br>

If she gets mad at one, she runs back to the other. And also I'm certain that she corrupted the mind of a young apprentice of mine that I pulled from jail during one of my recent visits to be one of my soldiers.</br></br>

During my many visits to jail, I tend to handpick the strongest and most capable men available to work for me installing roofs when they are released. Oftentimes, I wind up hiring the leaders of different groups of men in here and their strongest men as well. Whether it be from the group of Whites, Blacks, The Others, The Northerners, or the [unintelligible], I unite them all under my tutelage, in a way, having become the boss of bosses L.O.L.</br></br>

It's always given me a great feeling inside, being able to provide a future and a new way of life for these men and to give hope to those around me. I truly care about these people and just want to see them do well with their lives.</br></br>

But in this recent event, I met a 22-year-old kid from Colorado. He had only been here for a month and had no place to stay, no employment, and really wanted to train in mixed martial arts with me. So, I took him in. It had been almost six months of me lending one of my rooms in my house for him to stay in and teaching him a trade so he can survive on his own soon.</br></br>

But I couldn't quite get his head right. He was always fixated on these negative thoughts. And when I caught him trying to steal from me for the second time, I was forced to kick him out.</br></br>

Then, during a conversation about how he needed to do better in his life, he raised his voice to me as if to want to fight about it. So, I walked away to get some fight gloves to inform him that, if he wanted to fight, then we could do this.</br></br>

It was as I walked away that I'm certain my girlfriend, who was in the garage with us at the time working on a motorcycle, had told her what was unbeknownst to me at the time as her new boy toy that he'd better get something, because when I return, I'm likely to kick his little ass.</br></br>

As I returned to continue the conversation, simply holding the gloves in my hand, I noticed that he was frantically digging through a pile of tools on the ground. He had grabbed a ten-pound ball hitch from a truck, which was a ball for a pool table made of solid steel and connected to a metal bar as a handle.</br></br>

I didn't believe he would actually do anything with it as I continued to approach. As I made it back to where I had previously been standing to finish our conversation, with him having his back to me as he was still trying to pick his best weapon of choice, he then swung around, screaming, "Let's do this!"</br></br>

He caught me three times with it as he was swinging wildly, with my first thought being grateful that he must have put down the ball hitch and instead had been hitting me with his little baby fists, as I had felt nothing. But as the blood then began pouring down my face like a faucet, I immediately knew better.</br></br>

So, I then quickly dodged his next blow and locked him up in a bear hug so he could not swing again. I picked him up off the ground and slammed him face-first onto the ground in that same pile of tools. He then went limp as I scolded him in asking him the question of just what the fuck did he think he was doing?</br></br>

I then walked away, knowing that if I struggled around much, that my scalp just might begin to peel down my head, as I knew I was wounded severely but I couldn't see it. I went inside and called 9-1-1, and I was shocked that both she and him disappeared. When the police arrived, they refused to let me press the charges of attempted murder on him, stating that, without the third-party testimony of my girlfriend, it was my word against his.</br></br>

With my girlfriend claiming she didn't see anything when they called her on the phone, stating that she was busy building a motorcycle and wasn't paying attention, the two of them then spent the next week together but not until after immediately doubling back to my house that afternoon and robbing me of a couple thousand dollars' worth of my items after I cleaned up myself and went to work.</br></br>

The next day, they sold those items and purchased a gun for him to come back and finish the job. So, then I went and picked up another assault rifle to protect myself even though I was on probation and prohibited from doing so, as my Second Amendment rights had been stolen from me for no reason greater than because I said so.</br></br>

And then, with his failure to kill me with his pistol, as he was then robbed for his gun by the people driving him to my house once they realized whose house they were driving him to, it was at that time it was reported to the police that I was in possession of a firearm. And they came to my house and arrested me for having it after searching and finding it behind my bed.</br></br>

I'm in jail now, facing a two-year sentence, as I can tell you the system has truly failed me. My family has been torn apart in my absence due to the fact that I've now lost my house being here, and my employees are out of work, and I have customers wondering what to do as I've left five houses with roofs unfinished. And it's between the hardship of these events combined with others, including taunting phone calls from my girlfriends' ex-boyfriends with the topic being how they recently spent time with her, that has me wanting to take my revenge when I am released.</br></br>

But sitting here in jail for two months now has seemed to slow down the pace of me so desperately needing to get ahead of all this and make it right. It's given me a lot of time to sit and reflect upon all the ways I have failed myself and those I love. I should have and could have made better choices that would have produced a completely different outcome.</br></br>

I've been fortunate in gaining both clarity and newfound strengths in here - some mental strengths and some physical strengths - being that I am now well-rested, well-fed, and have nothing but time to work out. I'm in the best shape of my life as I'm nearing my prime. I've always known in my heart that simply being good and maintaining a positive outlook is the best way to happiness.</br></br>

But when these things happen to me that seem to cut so deep into my soul, it strains my ability to do well as part of me wishes to strike back at those that have wronged me and attack these evils with the complete power of all my might.</br></br>

But I know there's a bigger picture to all this, one that requires me to stay focused and hold the line for the greater good. I can't allow a person's actions and willingness to hurt me change who I am, because in the end, what it would cost me is myself and the purity I so value within. I refuse to give up on that.</br></br>

I won't let anything in this world change who I am or what I am. And it hasn't exactly been easy, but it seems to come naturally for me to be able to turn the other cheek with direct actions towards myself and be able to forgive and move on.</br></br>

I sometimes feel impenetrable by the evil ways of others in this world except when it comes to something bad being done to someone else. Those are actions I will not tolerate and must always step in to intervene, as it's hard for me to accept the suffering of others. With that being said, it is within this battle that I choose to ignore the bad things being done to me, thereby taking away its true power to hurt me.</br></br>

Instead, I choose to turn it all into something good, something wonderful even. I take it all in great stride, allowing myself to grow and evolve into an even better person from it, stronger than ever.</br></br>

I'm confident that if I just hold on and stay the course and continue to do good and only good things, that eventually all that I will ever receive from this world in return will be more good things as a result. I intend to set the example for those around me, especially for my children, to show them the way to making this life into and maintaining it as being a permanently-wonderful and amazing thing. I will show them all the power of what can be achieved in this world by maintaining positivity no matter what comes their way.</br></br>

In essence, I will give them all the proof they will ever need, as in this case, I already know that I am bigger, stronger, and more capable than my adversaries. There is nothing to be gained by hurting them. The only way to achieve the result that I am after is by displaying the wisdom that I have gained by all their actions against me and proving to them that we can all do better with our time here by letting go of all the hate.</br></br>

It's funny to me now as I have sat here reading through all these stories that I have written. And I'm not sure how I've missed seeing it this whole time, but as I was able to gain some serious wisdom as a teenager by taking seriously what I was taught by the adults around me, I was taught about our history and the mistakes that were made before us and the costs of those mistakes. I was able to then review all the facts and come to my own conclusion that peace and love was so vital to our existence, just as our parents before us eventually realized in the '60s.</br></br>

As it's clear to me now, where I had assumed that the parts attached to me as having been "that hippie kid" had died off eventually with me having been forced in a way to become a beast of sorts as a requirement necessary to accomplish all that I had in a world where hard labor was my only option to accommodate the needs of the responsibility I took on in becoming a father of four, that even with all my muscles and having this great physical strength and capable skillset, that my greatest strength, my most valuable asset, and my best virtue is now proving to be the knowledge I had gained so long ago, as it had truly always been my true self underneath all this bravado and not some profound spiritual breakthrough that I am now suddenly having.</br></br>

It has allowed me to succeed where I may have otherwise failed. And in the end, this is who I am, who I was, and who I will always be. And it makes me very proud that when I leave this world, I will leave with that as being my legacy.</br></br>

Yeah. I just want to read that whole last part again, but it is what it is. And, well, that's the end. I feel I've said it all. There's nothing left to say, really [chuckles].</br></br>

UCI: Oh, my gosh. Thank you so much for sharing that. That was amazing. I mean I haven't personally talked to you, but I've just heard wonderful things.</br></br>

And we're just so grateful for you and for being vulnerable and sharing what your experience has been like and, you know, just all of it.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah. I seem to have fallen in love with the whole experience of expressing myself on paper. It's kind of interesting and neat. It really feels good, and I appreciate you taking the time to listen, you know? It's important to me, and it's been wonderful.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah. Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: And with that, I would like to say that I didn't see it until I just finished this last night. I added that whole last page about how I wasn't sure I missed it this whole time.</br></br>

The little hippie dude in me isn't dead. He's right here just, you know, been in control the whole time. That's just who I am. I just added that last page last night.</br></br>

And it was upon the completion of that page I realized that was the final chapter in what's now a book, it appears to me like, with each of these stories being individual chapters with My Story being the first one and then into the Faith in Humanity and then perhaps Why We Love into Power of the Positivity and so forth with this being the final chapter. And I'm going to try to do my best to work it into its own little book.</br></br>

And I want to call it The Eternal Flame Within: the life and legacy of one man, written by a cage fighter fighting for his life from behind bars, which I think is interesting. Like, this grabs the attention of somebody, but it really has nothing to do with being a cage fighter. It's more about a spiritual struggle, you know?</br></br>

UCI: Yeah. Well, it has really touched a lot of us. And I, personally, was crying through a lot of that. But we just want to say thank you and for you being so vulnerable and calling us and taking the time to share with us your story, because it is important to us and for others to hear it and to know what's going on and just all the things that you've shared with us. Is there --</br></br>

Caller: Well, that's neat to hear you say that. It really is, yeah, because I mean these are just feeling that I have and thoughts that I have rolling around in my head. And these would've just been stories sitting in my sock drawer, as they have been for the past two years, you know, just doing nothing. So, this has been an amazing thing.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah. It's awesome, and we so appreciate you calling in. I know you said it's kind of the end. And so, that is definitely something to keep in mind, but we're so grateful for you. So, did you have any other questions or anything for me?</br></br>

Caller: I did. I was hoping...You could edit this out if you'd like [redacted].</br></br> 

UCI: Yeah, absolutely. And your stories will be up on our website at some point. And so, when you get out, everything's anonymous, but I'm sure you'll be able to know which one is yours.</br></br>

We don't edit it in any sort of way except removing information that's identifying. And just from hearing your one story, I don't think that's the case. So, that's just something to keep in mind too when you do get out, is go to our website and definitely --</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, yeah, definitely.</br></br>

UCI: - try and look through stuff. But thank you so much.</br></br>

Caller: And I did want - and you could have them contact me if there is a possibility of this - if you guys know anybody that works with publishing or anybody that could help me, authors that have other books or anybody that could help me turn this into an actual book and iron it all out and make it work, have them contact me. I'd really appreciate it.</br></br>

Otherwise, my uncle just recently retired. I might try to work through him for somebody if you guys don't have anything. But I would [unintelligible] your guys' university because you've been so [unintelligible] with these stories and putting it together.</br></br>

UCI: Absolutely. Yeah, absolutely. We'll keep everything in mind, but thank you so much. And I really hope tomorrow is a better day for you.</br></br>

Caller: Oh, you know what? This is going to cut off in a few seconds, but if you don't mind, if you have the time, I would like to call back, and I have a couple more things to tell you.</br></br>

UCI: Sure. Go ahead, yeah.</br></br>

Caller: Some very important things. I just saw them. I'd let them slip my mind. I'll call you right back.</br></br>

UCI: Call me right back.</br></br>

Caller: I'll talk to you in a minute. Okay.
