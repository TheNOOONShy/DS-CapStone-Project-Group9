This story was told by a person incarcerated at Theo Lacy.</br></br>


UCI: So, what has your COVID situation been like at your facility?</br></br>


Caller: It has its pros and cons, you know? It has its pros and cons but, for the most part, it kind of sucks because it keeps away from my family, you know? As far as visit goes, they have barely started to give us our visits back. But, for the most part, no contact, no visits, so, yeah. That sucks.</br></br> 


UCI: And, so, you said there’s pros and cons so, like, what, can you be a little more detailed?</br></br>


Caller: Well, as far as the pros go, I mean, it’s small things, it’s small victories for us like laundry. We get laundry every day; we get to turn in our laundry every day so that’s cool. You know, people like to stay clean, you know? And, we get a lot of cleaning supplies to clean ourselves and whatnot, as opposed to, you know, once a week or having to fucking bitch and beg to get cleaning supplies to clean your cell, you know?</br></br>


UCI: Yeah. And, so, you mentioned reduced visitation and just, because I also want to hear about it is programming. So, I just wanted to know, like, if you could talk a little more on that and how that’s affected you?</br></br>


Caller: As far as, shit, as far as program goes and the COVID, when the COVID first hit, it hit hard in December of last year. Shit, I was in one of these pods and, fuck, one person got it and we just thought he had a regular cold. Hold up, excuse me. Okay, yeah, one person had it, and we thought it was a regular cold and, next thing we know, it was just a complete outbreak. So, they ended up moving him out, then moved him and his celly out, they quarantined him, and then a couple other people started getting sick.</br></br> 


So, they shut down our pod, our sector, which is 16 cells to a sector, there’s six sectors. Six sectors, there’s 16 cells to each sector, okay, so, they locked us down, our sector down. They tested every one of us, all but two people didn’t have it. All but two people had it. And then, what was strange about them is they ended up moving us to another pod, to another sector, where there was people that didn’t have it. That shit didn’t make no kind of sense. But, I mean, it was a 30-day quarantine, and they just kept testing us and testing us and testing us. And then, next thing we know, all six sectors are fucking contaminated. They have the, the virus is just spreading like crazy. That was crazy, that was crazy, that was a crazy month. December, January, February, that was a crazy month.</br></br> 


UCI: And, so, my bad.</br></br> 


Caller: No, it’s just being on lockdown, you know?</br></br>


UCI: And, so, programming had recently started for you guys?</br></br>


Caller: Yeah, it’s slowly but surely is coming back.</br></br>
 
UCI: Okay, and you also noted, you noted reduced visitation and, how long has it been reduced and how long has it started to open up little by little?</br></br>


Caller: Well, visiting’s back. They’re giving us, right now, they’re giving us two visits per month, which is cool. You have to make a, your family has to make an appointment, then you get an hour. No, you get a half hour. And then, they said as, as the county goes through tiers, I guess we go through a yellow tier next, and then we’ll be getting more visits after that and, slowly but surely.</br></br>


UCI: Okay, and how has the COVID situation been like for your family or your loved ones?</br></br>


Caller: It’s crazy. You know what, I gotta go, man.</br></br> 


UCI: It’s fine.
