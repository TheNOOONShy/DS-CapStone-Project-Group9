This story was told by a person incarcerated at Chino.</br></br>

UCI: What has the COVID situation been like at your facility?</br></br>

Caller: Well, I first - me, myself, I first caught COVID, I was in a different dorm. So I caught COVID and then they moved me to a - they isolated me to a single-man cell for 14 days. I was there for 14 days and then after I got cleared, they put me on a dorm where COVID hadn’t hit.</br></br>

UCI: Mmhmm.</br></br>

Caller: I was there, so now that I’m here in this unit, COVID hit here. And everybody caught it here in this dorm, and they should’ve moved the people that caught COVID but everybody refused to move because they figured that pretty much they went on - everybody went on isolation here.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: So, everybody just decided that they were pretty much going to catch COVID again. Whoever wasn’t positive was going to just eventually become positive. I’m guessing that’s what they were thinking.</br></br>

And in order for the process to go through and we could just get off of quarantine. Now we’re on quarantine.</br></br>

UCI: Mmhmm. Gotcha, okay.</br></br> 

Caller: That's the process.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, yeah, yeah. And, so how has the vaccination situation been like at your facility? Like do you think, you know, they have been handling it well? Or do you think they’re kind of not doing good at, they're really doing their job well?</br></br>

Caller: I think they’ve been handling that well because they do encourage you [unintelligible] and take the vaccination and the booster. I mean me, myself, I’m not vaccinated but I’m thinking I should be vaccinated. They told me that I caught COVID and I can catch it again.</br></br> 

So I caught it once and I’m not vaccinated myself but there’s people who get vaccinated. You just have to request the vaccination. They don’t force you to take it.</br></br>

UCI: Mmhmm, gotcha. And so have they been providing, like, good information about the vaccine, like, in terms of, like, have they been telling you guys, like, what’s in it, what the side effects are going be, or anything like that?</br></br>

Caller: What was that? You’re getting cut off a little bit.</br></br>

UCI: Oh, sorry. So, have the correctional officers been giving you guys, like, information about the vaccine, like, such as what the side effects will be, what’s in the vaccine, or anything like that?
