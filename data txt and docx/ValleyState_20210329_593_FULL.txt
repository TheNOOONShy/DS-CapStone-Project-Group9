This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Valley State.</br></br>PrisonPandemic project,</br></br>Let me just state that we as prisoners have a far different experience to the pandemic than you free worlds people. It’s scary and it's hopeless because we know there is absolutely nothing the Department of Corrections can do to protect us. Literally every single one of us will catch the virus.</br></br> 

The few that don’t are the blessed few. There is no safety precautions or measures that can stop the spread of any virus in a state penitentiary. And any protocol CDCR implements is only to look good on paper for the politicians in Sacramento.</br></br>	It is more for the effect of keeping lawsuits at bay than protecting our lives. Hell, they kill us every day in subtle ways by denying or delaying us standard preventive medical care. We have a doctor here that systematically denies us treatment of any kind during regular times. He sure won’t save us in a pandemic.</br></br> 

Staff treat us as if we brought the virus to them instead of them bringing it to us. I told one officer I’ve been self isolating for 13 years inside these walls. The virus began in China. How the hell did I get it?</br></br>They have all these social distancing protocols in place that we can be punished for not following. Yet at the end of the way we are locked in a cell with eight men in it. There is no such thing as social distancing in prison.</br></br>When a man tests positive they make the entire cell to different units in the prison furthering the possibility of more transmission. They should just quarantine us where we are. They move the exposed people to one unit and the positive person to another.</br></br> 

When I went to the unit for the people who came in contact with an infected person. The officer of the unit greets us by saying if you don’t have the virus now you will by the time you leave this unit. Welcome to hell.</br></br>

Our privileges and freedoms have been taken away due to the pandemic. There is a fear that we may not even get those liberties back post pandemic. There is a long standing notion in California prisons, once CDCR takes something away from us we never get it back.</br></br> 

They took away our weights in the 90s. They took away our tobacco in the early 2000s. Now due to the pandemic most of our liberties are gone. Chances are we may not get some of them back.</br></br>On a personal level I am having a real difficult time. Our mental health services have been disrupted due to COVID. I have not had regular visits with mental health. I am bi-polar. I have a personality disorder also.</br></br> 

I am prone to suicidal ideology and thoughts, and too aggressive and violent thoughts as well. I attend regular therapy sessions in normal times. COVID has reduced us to emergencies only.</br></br> 

If I’m having harmful or self-destructive thoughts I must fill out a request for a visit and wait seven to 10 days to be seen. By then I could be dead or kill someone else.</br></br>Our mental health system is subpar as it is. COVID makes it even more so. They are not even trained in treating guys like me that have personality disorders and are sociopathic. The pandemic has also had a huge impact on inmates serving life sentences.</br></br>

Those inmates are required to participate in self help or rehabilitative programs in order to prepare for parole hearings. Some of those guys are having those hearings without being able to participate in those programs due to COVID.</br></br>COVID has really turned our small world upside down. There are a wide range of negative impacts on us as inmates. At this point it feels like relief may never come.</br></br> 

PS. One way you may be able to help is to start up a prison penpal program. Many of us could use friends and positive or emotional support. If you ever do sign me up.
