This story was told by a person incarcerated at an ICE/Private-Contractor facility.</br></br>

Caller: And that whole prison was doing well until, from what I believe, one of the - from what I had heard, one of the staff members is the one that started bringing it in.</br></br>

And then it was just spread like wildfire after that, you know?</br></br>

UCI: You can't make that up, dude.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah. So, that's exactly what happened. So, yeah, it's a rough ride.</br></br>

UCI: That's, you know, that's - what's it called? I want to let you know that the project has actually gotten that story more than a few times, where we've been finding a direct correlation between the way that the CO's are treating COVID at certain facilities and what happens to the inmates are directly related.

Caller: Yeah, and it sucks because they weren't mandatory- like, they didn't have to get vaccinated, right? It wasn't mandatory for them to take it.</br></br>

UCI: Crazy.</br></br>

Caller: So, you know, it was like one at a time was coming in sick or whatever. And, yeah, there were a couple of CO's that actually passed away and, obviously-</br></br>

UCI: Oh, my goodness.</br></br>

Caller: -another couple people that passed away [unintelligible], it's all on the website. On their website, it tells you how many people died.</br></br>

UCI: Well, there you go.</br></br>

Caller: And then, that all started from people being transferred from LA county without them being tested. They just started bringing people in, you know? They bring in busloads of people from LA county that are sick, and that's how you start contaminating, you know?</br></br>

UCI: That's right. There was no consideration, it seemed.</br></br>

Caller: No. of course, not. They don't care. They don't care about your wellbeing. They just care about their paycheck. But what are you going to do?
