This story was told by a person incarcerated at Chuckawalla.</br></br>

UCI: So what facility are you currently housed at?</br></br>

Caller: Chuckawalla.</br></br>

UCI: And what is the current COVID-19 situation at your facility?</br></br>

Caller: Ridiculous. Pretty much within the last month, my entire yard has been exposed. They, I just personally just got over it a couple of weeks ago. They put me in central medical for four, five days.</br></br> 

Pretty much treated me like I was in the hole. And they put me in a building with another hundred and some odd inmates that were, also had COVID as well. There’s no quarantining process.</br></br> 

Like, there was no really legitimate quarantining process. They just had us in an open dorm, you know? Walking around, mingling amongst all of us. They took our vitals twice a day, more or less in my opinion for show more than really for any medical purposes.</br></br>

And then before we even were technically tested to see if we had COVID anymore or not, as long as we stopped showing symptoms for 14 days from the day that they quarantined me, took me back to my original building.</br></br> 

UCI: So they didn’t even give you a second test to determine if you didn’t have COVID-19?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, no. Once I tested positive, they stopped testing me.</br></br> 

UCI: And when you say that they treated you like you were in the hole, what did you mean by that?</br></br>

Caller: It felt more like I was on a disciplinary action than just being sick. You know?</br></br>

Caller: Like the entire time from, they were checking our temperatures twice a day. And when it hit me my temperature was high, and from that second when they made that call to take me from this building and put me in central medical, they, there was about 10 officers who were in the building.</br></br>

I was delirious. I was, you know, I was very dizzy and discombobulated. They were telling me I had to leave. I was panicking about college work that I needed to bring with me.</br></br>

We were arguing. It was a big scene. They took me out, locked me in a cell pretty much, and the doctor would come and check me periodically. I was vomiting everything up. I didn't eat for days.</br></br> 

The doctor came in and said I could have a Pedialyte, and they didn't bring me that Pedialyte for probably four or five hours after that moment, and I'd already been beyond throwing up food and stomach acid and everything else. Me asking four different people to bring me that first bottle of Pedialyte.</br></br> 

When I asked for something soft and easy to digest to give myself nutrients like a booster and Ensure, they said to me that I could have another Pedialyte, and that was it. The whole thing, they gave me two Pedialytes, that was it.</br></br> 

UCI: So how was COVID-19 handled at your facility at the beginning of the outbreak?</br></br>

Caller: Very lightly. They have an announcement on the intercom system like five times a day about “We’re all in this together. And we should all wear masks.”</br></br> 

And half the time I see officers not wearing masks, the time we got sergeants that pretty much hate us as inmates and just yell at us just to yell at us. It’s not even about actual safety precautions, it’s just an excuse to ride our asses about anything.</br></br> 

UCI: So is it being handled differently now?</br></br>

Caller: No. We’re actually doing the exact same thing, and as traumatic as an experience as I just went through. I perso- strongly feel that within 90 to 120 days, whenever I’m susceptible to get this virus again, I’m going to go through the exact same debacle.</br></br> 

I was just going to say the other yards that are already going through this again, on their second wave, they’re doing the exact same thing they did last time they got it.</br></br> 

UCI: Okay, so they’re not really separating the yards in case like one is contaminated?</br></br>

Caller: No. So, my yard for some reason was the only yard that for almost a year didn’t get the virus. The two buildings that they kept regular, they cleared out one of our buildings as the contamination building, you know. I’m making quote fingers as I say this.</br></br>

And as the only yard that didn’t catch COVID for almost a year, they were taking inmates from those other three yards that were contracting the virus and bringing them to this yard. Then they were having officers work that building and then come into one of our buildings to work another shift, a double shift, without decontaminating in any way.</br></br>

Pretty much, I’m almost positive that, you know, I mean, obviously it had to have been the staff that exposed us to it. It's not like I left and went to Walmart and came back. But I’m almost positive it was one of these officers that was pulling a double that came and brought it to my building. You know?</br></br>

UCI: And are the guards also wearing face masks and using hand sanitizer or anything to protect you all, and themselves from COVID?</br></br>

Caller: They’re wearing masks and yeah, I mean, you see them with hand- little bottles of hand sanitizer, but that's - the sanitizer thing has been a standard issue for every correctional officer long before this, this COVID thing. But honestly, there’s a lot more that they can do, you know. The way my building is designed, there’s a secluded area that's upstairs, that they can work from and not have any direct contact with us, and could have kept us a lot safer than the way they did.</br></br>  

UCI: Okay, so what would make the situation at your facility better?</br></br>

Caller: Less inmates. They’re not, they say that they’re socially distancing us. They’re, my - the guy I sleep next to me on both sides of me is no more than, no less than three feet away from me. Not actually six feet apart.-</br></br>

We’re too overcrowded even with the bodies that they just randomly started picking out and sending to other prisons, without righteously, you know, taking us to committee and telling us, “Okay this is what happened.” You know? They just took a couple hundred bodies from every building and said, “You’re going to the prison next door.” But it still wasn’t enough.</br></br> 

UCI: Before they transfer the inmates, are they getting tested?</br></br>

Caller: You know what, I don’t know about that Maybe in the beginning honestly, now they probably are. But in the beginning I don’t think they were. They were just grabbing bodies and taking them.</br></br>

UCI: And how has the COVID-19 at your facility affected your loved ones?</br></br>

Caller: Honestly, my family and my emergency contact had no idea about any of this until finally I was able to make a phone call myself. And between not having access to a phone for a couple days, and then being too sick to even get off my bed for a couple more days after that.</br></br>

None of my family knew for at least five days that I was sick. And I know inmates that had pneumonia and were in the hospital inches away from death, and their family still didn’t know until they came back and personally called their family.</br></br>

Their family was calling the prison, they said, “Oh he’s fine.” Well, meanwhile, he was actually in the hospital. They’re just trying to keep this under wraps as much as possible.</br></br>

UCI: And what has it been like for you to have reduced visitation and programming?</br></br>

Caller: Oh my god. If it weren’t for being able to do college out of, you know, through proctors right now, I would be absolutely nuts. You know that’s the only thing we have right now. And that's the few of us who are already enrolled in college that are doing that. The rest of these guys are, you know, we’re like a pressure cooker ready to explode with frustration.</br></br>

UCI: How have you been coping with the crisis?</br></br>

Caller: I could probably do better. I mean, I already have anger and control issues as it is. And this whole experience, this whole year has been unbelievable. Like, I don't even think I have words to describe how frustrating it’s been.</br></br> 

UCI: It sounds like it's not going very well and I’m sorry that you’re going through that right now.</br></br> 

Caller: Well, thank you. We appreciate that you guys are doing this for us. It’s nice to know finally that people like you helping us, are helping us give a voice to truly how corrupt it is in here.</br></br> 

UCI: What else would you like people to know about your experience?</br></br>

Caller: Just that when they call these prisons and the staff members are telling them that it's not as bad as we make it out to seem, that honestly it's the other way around. That it is the way it is that when we call home and we say, “It's like this”.</br></br> 

They don’t take it serious, they treat us like we’re the problem when they’re the ones contracting the virus. And all they do is, when they come to work they get their temperature checked and they get asked a survey. And then they come in here and they contaminate us and they expose us to this and they make our lives a living hell because of their incompetence.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah. I’m sorry that’s a really frustrating situation.</br></br>

Caller: Yes. Yes it is.</br></br>

UCI: We have about, I don’t know how many minutes we have remaining but if there was anything else you wanted to add or if you just wanted to continue talking, this is your time.</br></br> 

Caller: Pretty much, I just, like I said, thank you guys for you know, I don’t know if guys are volunteering for this, or if this is a job, either way thank you for, for taking your time and doing this for us. It means a lot.</br></br> 

UCI: Yeah we just wanted to let you know that we’re out here thinking about you guys  and hopefully this will help to make some reform or at least bring some awareness. But if there isn’t anything else, I wanted to thank you very much for participating in PrisonPandemic.</br></br> 

Please consider telling your friends about us and seeing if they would also like to call in. And I’m not sure if you know that we have a P.O. box?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, you know what, actually someone just brought me the letter by for the mailing list and all that stuff, so I already signed up for it.</br></br> 

UCI: Oh, okay.</br></br>

Caller: So that’s what you’re talking about right?</br></br>

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: Okay, yeah, I’m already signed up for it. I look forward to starting to get the newsletters and everything.</br></br> 

UCI: Okay.</br></br>

Caller: Pretty much we’re going to run out of time here. But thank you again for everything you’re doing for us. We really do appreciate it in here.</br></br> 

UCI: Yeah, of course. I hope you take care. I’m sorry, it's a really frustrating situation. But please take care and we’re out here thinking about you.</br></br>

Caller: All right thank very much. You have a goodnight tonight.</br></br> 

UCI: You too.</br></br> 

Caller: Bye.</br></br>

UCI: Bye.
