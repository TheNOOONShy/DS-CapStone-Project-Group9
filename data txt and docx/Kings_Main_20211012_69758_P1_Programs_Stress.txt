This story was told by a person incarcerated at Kings County Jail.</br></br>

Caller: I go out there to – to society, and it's affecting me. It's affecting me in communicating with - with people, my community members. It's affecting me in my – in relationships or lack thereof, you know? It's affecting me in communicating with people at work sites, you know?</br></br> 

I can’t even – it’s cause I've been out of this – I’ve been out of this for so long. I've been in and out, in and out, in and out; always over some dumb — this stuff that make no sense, you know? All behind drugs, you know?</br></br>

When I was out recently, you know, it was kinda, it was difficult – it was difficult, because I was – I was under the influence, and I'm trying to get assistance. I'm trying to get help.</br></br>

At the same thing – at the same time, the way I'm going about things is not – it could be done better, but I was under the influence, you know? I'm trying to seek help. I’m trying to – I was going to the mental health. I went to mental – here in King County Jail.</br></br>

I'm going to certain places, and certain places are requiring – are requiring a phone, you know? And I can't get – I can’t use the phone because I don't have a phone of my own, you know? I'm using other people's phones and I’m just doing – I was just a mess.</br></br> 

I'll submit. I ain’t gonna lie. I was a mess, you know? But when you're a mess, you know, and you're looking for help and you’re trying to get help, that's when you should be able to find it.</br></br>

You should be able to get help. You should be able to get assistance. When you're a mess, and you know that you're a mess, and you ask for help, and you're trying to seek help; man, that's – that’s when a person should come, you know?</br></br> 

And give you the help that you need, you know? Programs. Give you assistance, you know? </br></br>

I reached out, tried to ask the parole probation officer for – for assistance. That's what parole is for, you know? They're there. They have resources. They have assistance.</br></br> 

I got out of prison, ma'am, and you know – look, I'm right back in jail. And look, you know, it's been happening and ongoing, you know? Ongoing, you know? It - it sucks.</br></br>

And I admit to them – I asked them for a program. I asked them for a program to get into a program to give me – so I can get some vocational trades. The skills that I have acquired just throughout the years, just, you know, make them known.</br></br> 

Just – maybe I can hone in on those and – and sharpen them. And things that I haven't learned, that I haven’t – that I don't know, I can learn, you know? You know, like I said, a vocational trade.</br></br>

There's programs that have counseling, that have mental health, that have, you know, job readiness on — on-site – on hand. I mean, they have all these different things and all – and these programs – different programs in different cities, different states, you know?</br></br>

Programs that I don't qualify for here because of whatever past charges or whatever past charge or whatever; you know, cause on parole, certain programs are only for parolees or don't accept this, well you know what?</br></br> 

There's programs in different cities, different states because they have a wide range of – variety of different things because it’s a lot bigger – the population’s a lot bigger, you know? So, how about something like that, you know?</br></br>

But, you know it’s – it’s – I feel it's – it’s not right, you know? It’s – I – I pray to God about this all the time, you know? Let me – let me get help. I've never had a.
