Hello PrisonPandemic Project,</br></br>

First of all, thank you for taking time to consider the health and welfare of many prisoners like myself.</br></br>

As you can see, I am serving a 43 year to life sentence. This is the first time during this 19 years that I have been able to express myself.</br></br>

It is sad that such a terrible plague has gripped us all. I was recently released from isolation due to COVID-19 exposure. I can hardly believe the way this prison is handling the pandemic! And those who have not come down with it. However I do not wish to elaborate due to possible retaliation.</br></br>

Again, I do appreciate you and your colleagues’ concern and the work you do. Some of the inmates treated COVID-19 as a hoax. That is until so many of us come down with it.</br></br>

Since I have just become aware of your organization, I do not have any artwork suitable for submission. However, I will pass along your address and the nature of your work to anyone who may be interested in your cause.</br></br>

Thank you.
