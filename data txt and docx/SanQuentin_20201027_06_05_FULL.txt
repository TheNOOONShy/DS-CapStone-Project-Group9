This story was told by a staff member at San Quentin.</br></br>

UCI: What was the COVID-19 situation at this facility when you worked there?</br></br>

Caller: Well, I saw it arc from zero cases to get up to almost 75 percent of our patient population, prison patient population infected by COVID. That was the reason why I left. So, at the time that I left, San Quentin was still about 50 to 70 percent of the inmate population was affected.</br></br>

The housing situation was still conducive to the COVID spread, although they had reduced some of the population in the dormitory setting, which were about 200 placed inmates per dorm. That was dorm three, four, and five, and then dorms one and two were only 100; they were a special population.</br></br> 

They did create a gym setting, but still the cots were less than six feet apart, and the ventilation systems were not adequate to filter out an airborne or aerosol contaminant, like COVID. The housing units were still five stories tall, open-barred, and social distancing was impossible. There was absolutely no way to physically distance, including staff.</br></br>

The situations with masks were such that officers would put on, some, most officers, I would say, would put on their mask if their superior were around. But most of the time, they chose not to wear their mask, or wore it with their nose exposed, or around their chins. I had witnessed personally, not last month, officers going around the tiers, meaning the housing units, talking about how COVID is a joke, that they hope they get it because then they get a paid vacation. Not issuing sanitary supplies, from the very beginning to the very end, in the quantities that were needed to ensure that inmates were not getting exposed or infected with COVID.</br></br> 

The medical care was simply monitoring for those who were COVID-positive, and there was no separation, in the beginning and in the middle, that infected patients were still housed with un-infected, or non-positive COVID inmates. So it was pretty bad.</br></br>

I am still in touch with former colleagues, and it’s still, the pervasive problem is getting the corrections officers to buy into wearing their masks. It’s still an issue, and it’s an issue so much so that it’s been commented on from staff to superiors in meetings, public meetings, and there’s just no way. There’s literally no way to enforce mask usage.</br></br>  

UCI: Mmhmm.</br></br> 

Caller: And that’s what we’re being told, that's what we're - they were being - well we were being told kinda what the current staff are being told at this point.</br></br> 

UCI: Mmhmm.</br></br> 

Caller: Or they would tell them this truth, and say, “No, everyone’s compliant.” But these are the management team, who are not on the ground, who are not in work spaces where inmates are, they’re sequestered on a different floor, so they have absolutely zero opportunity to make sure that there is mask compliance.</br></br>

UCI: Thank you for sharing. Do you, are you aware, while you were working at this facility, if any of the officers that were working had tested positive?</br></br>

Caller: Many! 270.</br></br>

UCI: Okay. Thank you, again. And what has it been like for you, having to cope with this crisis? When you were at the prison, and now that, now that you are no longer working there?</br></br>

Caller: It was so, not only just, you know, incredibly stressful, so it was very stressful to [unintelligible]. I did and because oftentimes I’d have to be in a room alone with an inmate with the door shut. And, you know, the mask situation did not come about until, I think, late June, early July. That’s when mandatory masks were a policy, although it wasn’t enforced. So not only was the patient terrified that they were going to get COVID from me, somebody who goes in and out of the prison, but I was terrified that I was with a patient who had not yet been tested, because in the beginning, there wasn’t any testing.</br></br> 

We’re talking about in June, all of June. So there was limited testing that was afforded to San Quentin, for whatever reason, and when patients came down with COVID-like symptoms, they were first being tested for the flu. And we know that the flu tests are not 100 percent. So if they - there’s a lot of false positives. So when they were tested for the flu, if they tested positive for the flu, they would not be, it would not be followed up with a test for COVID, and they would be sent back to the unit.</br></br> 

So if indeed, this person, in June, was infected with COVID, they were going back to the crowded housing units, without adequate ventilation, without adequate sanitation, without hand sanitizer. And they prevented hand sanitizer from being distributed because it had alcohol in it, and they didn’t want inmates to make pruno or drink it. And they were sending these inmates back to mingle with the general population, to sleep in a cell with a, you know, a possible non-COVID-infected inmate, and go to classes, or you know, do whatever they needed to do, just move around the prison.</br></br> 

So, it was then given, we were given an opportunity to work from home one or two days a week. The technology was 100 percent inadequate to do our jobs. And that was difficult and stressful because we were trying to meet the same expectations as if we were in the office, and really received no guidance or help on how to properly do our jobs. And then, on top of it, on July 1st, everyone got a 10 percent pay decrease from the state of California, so essentially Governor Newsom, because of COVID, the state of California did not meet its budget.</br></br> 

So we received a 10 percent pay decrease, a two-day furlough, no increases, no step increases, annual step increases, which most of the staff were needing and looking forward to. And working in an unsafe environment with cavalier management, that was dishonest, appeared to not care about the health and well-being of the inmates, and, sorry, I’m just going on and on, but, and essentially did not, they did not make any effort to enforce the mask policy.</br></br>

Caller: The most frustrating thing about my experience is that CDCR is a closed system.</br></br>

UCI: Mmhmm.</br></br>

Caller: There is very little opportunity for outsiders who have expertise and knowledge in mitigating these issues to come into the prison and offer real solutions that could’ve wholly stopped the irresponsible spread of COVID. There were some UCSF doctors who were allowed to come into San Quentin. They then made the recommendations of decreasing the prison population by up to 50 percent, and that was the immuno-infectious specialist, and the disease control physician, and that was ignored.</br></br> 

UCI: Mmhmm.</br></br>

Caller: And then the major outbreak happened. But CDCR spoke to folks in Sacramento to tell every media outlet that they're, they are, you know, ensuring patient’s safety, that they hold the patient’s safety, in the highest regard, and they’re doing everything they can. And in actual, that might be in theory, but in practice, it’s absolutely not happening. There’s a huge disconnect from Sacramento to what’s happening on the ground, and there really isn’t any way to, to oversee or to make sure these policies are actually being implemented. That’s the frustrating part, is that they’re actually able to get away with it.</br></br>

This is the reason why I left CDCR. And, it’s a job that I loved. It’s a job that I felt I could do some good and really change the way that, you know, inmates were functioning. And the fact that I had to leave because of mismanagement and gross negligence was pretty heartbreaking. So it wasn’t my choice, I don’t have a vendetta, it’s not malicious.</br></br> 

I have a phenomenal job now, so I have no, you know, no motivation to, you know, make something up, or to overstate what had been happening, but, it’s a closed system. And most people don’t even have a clue of what’s going on, because there’s no way you can get in, so it’s frustrating.
