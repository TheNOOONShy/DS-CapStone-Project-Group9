This story was told by a person incarcerated at Mule Creek.</br></br>

Caller: We have the phone calls and all. But even just speaking with you right now, my emotions are kind of raw because it's like, you don't really have an outlet in here, you know, it's not something that you express in an emotional way, you know.</br></br>

You talk about it with everybody, and everybody's complaining about it. Everybody's aware of what's going on in here. But to actually have any kind of healing or closure from it, it's, you know, it's not easy in here. It's very hard. But, after doing - you kind of become - you kind of get used to, you know, how to deal with things and just, you know, kinda shrug it off.</br></br>

But it doesn't mean it's easy. But you just learn to let it go over time.
