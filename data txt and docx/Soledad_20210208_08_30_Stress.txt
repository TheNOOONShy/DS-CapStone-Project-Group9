This story was told by a person incarcerated at Soledad.</br></br>Caller: It's just it’s really stressful 'cause you don’t know what’s gonna happen.</br></br>Everyday there’s some change. They’re either gonna move you or some people die or it- I mean you never know what you’re gonna get. They vaccinated all the police and all the staff. Where’s the vaccine for the inmates?</br></br>Inmates are sitting around here, they doing all this work, they can’t even get a vaccine. It’s sad. I have a strong proposition, and I read and stuff like that, but it’s sad to see people suffer in here like this.</br></br>It- I mean, if you can communicate, you can communicate, but it’s like you’re not being heard. I mean there was a guy in my building, he kicked the door all night long. We told them what the issue was, the police said, “Oh well, you know it don’t bother me.” I said, “Man, he’s not in here, he’s not even in here doing more than 90 days and you guys are just letting this guy kick the doors? You guys need to check on him, man.”</br></br>We had a guy try to commit suicide in here, in one of these buildings I’m in.  And then in the other one, the guy actually did it. So, you know, suicide rates are up in here. Normally we don’t have any of that stuff happening here.
