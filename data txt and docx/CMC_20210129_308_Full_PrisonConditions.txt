Dear PrisonPandemic Project,</br></br>

I love you and appreciate you! I'm a private person, and I don't have any privacy in prison even though I have my own cell! People will literally sneak into my cell and go through my things and collect information.</br></br>

I know that the world doesn't revolve around me because there are too many appealing people on the internet that are look-alikes, and others who have their own distinguishable identities. I'm not in any way trying to make it seem as if I'm better than anyone else.</br></br>

I believe that my color coordinating expertise separates me from the wannabees. It's flattering to me when people post identical styles on the internet that I wore.</br></br>

There aren't many people that I know that can truly say that they were trendsetters. It's another thing when someone is being an imposter.</br></br>

Two things I can elaborate on about the pandemic is that it's dividing people and bringing racism to the forefront, in my opinion.</br></br>

Sending you good thoughts. And hoping you believe in yourself just as much as I believe in you. I thought I'd steal some of your words. Pray for me!
