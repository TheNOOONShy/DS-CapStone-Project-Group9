This story was told by a person incarcerated at Chuckawalla.</br></br>UCI: I can't imagine how it would be. Can you tell me about how your routine and your daily life has been impacted by these things? I know some people have, you know, told me about visitations being cancelled, things like that.</br></br>Caller: That’s horrible right there, I mean mental health wise. I mean they’ve offered you two free phone calls a month since, I don’t know, February or March, or something like that. But that by no means does that take the place of a visit.</br></br>UCI: Wow.</br></br>Caller: I mean they’ve like allowed us to get two packages a quarter which is kind of unheard of but still, I mean, unless you're like, people - be really got money or something, who can even afford that?</br></br>UCI: So just to clarify, it sounds like the two phone calls were like a policy change that they, they’re now giving those away because of, they took away the visiting restrictions?</br></br>Caller: I don’t know. Well that’s in place of visiting.</br></br>UCI: Got it, right.</br></br>Caller: So, they got, I guess CDC got along with GlobalTel, and I don’t know who’s paying for it. I don’t know but we’re getting it now. They got it all set all the way through like next May, so I know there’s not supposed to be, and I’ve heard there’s not visiting in 2021 so, you know? I don’t know and that’s you know?
