12-02-2020</br></br>Hello and thank you for the message.</br></br> 

God has sustained us through this challenge. I know you guys are in the same boat. What really makes me sad is all the news upon news of people outside who lost their jobs or their lives due to COVID for us.</br></br>

A little bit depressed my little sister passed away. I didn't get to see her or some friends that die. Maybe we learn a little bit about loving each other more. We don't have visits. It's been seven months are there room has gone from all day with everyone to one hour 45 minutes with 1/4 of the building.</br></br>

Our yard schedules have also been dramatically reduced and boring around all over the hours of the day and every other day at night time only. This limits out ability to go to store. My family has been very very supportive.</br></br>Deuteronomy 8:3</br></br>God bless you all.
