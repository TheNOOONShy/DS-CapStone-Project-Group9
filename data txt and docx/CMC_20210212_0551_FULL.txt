This story was told by a person incarcerated at CMC (California Men's Colony).</br></br>

UCI: We are looking for anything that you want to tell us about your situation right now. It can be about the effects. It can be about your prison conditions. It can be about how you are feeling about COVID. So anything that you feel comfortable with sharing with us, without identifying you are, you can tell us any of that.</br></br> 

Caller: Oh, OK.</br></br> 

UCI: So I could give you, I could give you some questions that we already have, or if you have information you want to share with us.</br></br> 

Caller: Well I’m just trying to figure out exactly, like I said. I'm trying to make sure I word it correctly. You know, cuz it did affect me, not the way it did other inmates here.</br></br>

At least at that point in time, I didn't get affected as much because I completely lost a little bit of my sense of smell. And not so much anything else. But now that I'm kind of looking at it.</br></br>

Like I'm having a hard time breathing and stuff like that. I think it affected me more than I thought. And I think the way a lot of guys here- I think the way they feel was that we weren’t quite understanding how- where they’re just kind moving inmates from one dorm to other dorms, kind of just moving guys around.</br></br>

And putting them into a facility where other housing units were like “well we’ve been resolved, considered resolved,” which means they've been at least two weeks to get a positive test and will resolve already into bringing in those who just tested positive so some guys were kinda questioning that trying to figure, well, why are they doing that? We couldn’t figure out why, what was the reasoning behind it. So-</br></br>

So I’m not sure exactly what kind of questions you have.</br></br>

UCI: Okay well we are just looking at- well first I want to ask what facility are you currently housed at?</br></br>

Caller: CMC West.</br></br>

UCI: CMC West?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah. California Men's Colony.</br></br>

UCI: Okay. Thank you. And then we're asking, has the conditions changed since the beginning of the pandemic to now? Like have the people in there been changing the way that they handle COVID since the beginning of the pandemic to now?</br></br>

Caller: Uh, you know that’s they- I know they've done things where they’ve like, inside the dorm, they set up like quote unquote pods. You know, cuz in there, like the pods are like, indoor pods are six feet apart, you know, but, but basically, within a pod area, it’s- you have four bunk beds, and you got two guys for each bunk.</br></br>

And so now they want us to practice six feet social distancing. But, but yeah, the bunks are basically within three feet of each other. So it's kind of hard to practice six feet of social distancing.</br></br>

And I know at one point, they had reduced the amount of men inside each dorm, but now they're starting to fill them back up again. So I'm not sure what- how they're transitioning guys in and out. So it's so- I guess they’re doing some stuff.</br></br>

And you know, at this point in time, we have dorms that are only going one, one dorm at a time to use the yard, use the phone so that way we're not crossing any other dorms. So they've done stuff like that, trying to reduce it.</br></br>

And, and you know, it can be frustrating, because some guys are gonna want to be outside and basically getting one hour, pretty much an hour a day going out, you know, but-</br></br>

And they’re starting to get jobs up again so guys are starting to go back to work. And so that’s- so guys are feeling good about that, and I think that's more than anything else is that- I think sometimes we feel confined if not we’re able to go out and have the quote unquote freedom to go out and do things like before the pandemic hit and stuff like that.</br></br>

UCI: Right, I understand. And is there anything that you could think of that would make the situation better at your facility?</br></br>

Caller: Uh, you know I think communication, to kind of get an understanding of what's going on. See you know, it’s uh- we’re trying to- you know, ask officers, you know, say “hey what’s going on?” They’re like, you know, “we’re not quite sure what's going on,” compared to communication against when the higher ups down from the medical to officer that gets- so we're getting lost in translation, so to speak.</br></br>

And so like, there are times we're- we’ll ask the officer, “Do you know what with this?” Like, you know what, I don't know, cuz I'm not really getting a full answer. So I can't answer your questions.</br></br>

And the one that above me he can’t answer my questions cuz no one's really kind of getting the, I guess, either an explanation or and I think it’s so new, the pandemic, that I think everybody's still trying to figure out, what, you know, how do we go through this? How do we approach it? In- and there's nothing- there's also a big reason why I think something been done the way it was being done.</br></br>

You know, cuz I'm thinking well everybody's been hit with this first time, no one really knew, or knows, even still, like, how do we handle this, you know maybe we’re still learning to try to figure things out.</br></br>

You know, we still have guys who are still- have not returned back to the home dorm and stuff like that. There’s still some guys in the medical facility. And so, some guys were hit harder than others. And you try to do the best you can I guess.</br></br>

UCI: Has this situation in your facility affected your loved ones at all?</br></br>

Caller: Yes it has, I haven’t really been able to communicate with them. I've had family actually pass away but like that, and so they're concerned and stuff like that. Cuz they're not able to use the phone and stuff like that when I first started out, so matter of fact, actually, I got someone else who needs to use the phone right now so I need to go.</br></br>

UCI: Okay, I just want to let you know, thank you so much for participating in PrisonPandemic and please consider telling your friends about us.</br></br>

Caller: Okay, I will.</br></br>

UCI: Thank you so much.</br></br>

Caller: Okay. you’re welcome. Bye bye.</br></br>

UCI: Bye bye.
