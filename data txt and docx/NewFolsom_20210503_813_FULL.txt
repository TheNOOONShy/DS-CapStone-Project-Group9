UCI: Okay cool. And so, what has your COVID situation been like at your facility?</br></br>

Caller: Well, it’s been - it’s been, I’ve been down 25 years, you know, so, and, you know, there’s been a lot of people in here caught COVID-19, you know. It’s been like, we’ve been on lockdown, and you know, they, they did not give the vaccine, the vaccine inside the prison, you know. It’s working slowly, you know, because, I guess, I guess that, I guess it’s just up to, I don’t know, they - they, they’ve been kind of slow on the vaccine, you know, I - I only got one shot since I’ve been here. I haven’t caught COVID-19.</br></br>

Right now, we on lockdown, you know, 'cause they doing quarantine, you know, make sure nobody, you know, get infected with the COVID-19 from other inmates. You know, that got it is the problem, you know.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: Still there?</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, yeah.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah.</br></br>

UCI: And so -</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, so basically, mm-hmm?</br></br>

UCI: Oh no, no, I’ll, I’ll let you keep going, my bad.</br></br>

Caller: Well, I was saying, you know I’ve been, it’s been like very difficult, stressing, you know, just very stressing, you know. It’s, things been going kind of like downhill, you know kind of bad, you know.</br></br> 

Been on this lockdown, you know because of the COVID-19 virus, you know, say it’s going around, you know, and they need to get more vaccines in the prisons so they can, you know, give shots to the inmates so, prison inmates so they, so they won’t spread the germs around because we usually getting it, they usually getting it from the streets from the staff that come with that COVID-19 virus. They bringing it to the institution, to us, and we get sick and next thing you know we in, we in the hospital, you know?</br></br>

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: And so, you know, it’s been kind of stressing, you know I been, you know I just hope that, you know I - I get released on May of this year, of 2021. You know, I’d be glad to get up out of here 'cause I’m tired of this lockdown. I’m tired of you know, wearing these, you know, I got to wear masks regardless even if I get on the street because you know it’s still, you know, the - the disease been going around pretty bad in prison, the COVID-19 virus.</br></br>

And, and we’ve been on lockdown, you know, and stuff like that, it’s been very difficult, you know not getting yard, you know. We barely get yard. It’s very difficult and it’s stressing, you know, I’ve been down 25 years, and it’s difficult. I’m - I’m ready to get out, you know.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, and, and on, yeah and on that note, how you said that you’re wearing masks, is there anything else that they provide you for your safety?</br></br>

Caller: Now what’d you say?</br></br>

UCI: I said regarding the note, yeah regarding the note on, like, how you said that they provide you masks, is there anything else that they provide you for your own safety?</br></br>

Caller: So, for the COVID-19?</br></br>

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: Is that what you said?</br></br>

UCI: Is, yeah, yeah.</br></br>

Caller: Well, you know, they come by, you know they give us, test us, you know like, you know have to make us, rub the things in the nose, you know, and they do, they do tests to make sure, to see if you’re sick or not, so, so there’s stuff, they do do that, you know? And you know they just got, they have us on lockdown for, 'cause they were searching for weapons, you know, and stuff like that, and - and a lot of people been committing suicide since I been here in this prison, you know?</br></br>

Some people die a normal death and some people be committing suicide, you got to go on these, you know, BSAS lockdowns, you know, suicide watch, you know, because it’s overcrowded. The prison’s overcrowded and it’s very difficult, you know what I’m saying? It’s very stressing, you know?</br></br> 

Some people can’t cope with a celly, you know, and it’s very difficult, yeah, it’s time, you know, and I know that this week, 'cause of, they doing a lot of time, they stressed out and depressed, and stuff, you know stuff like that, you know so, a lot of them, you know, been put in BOP, on - on program, for their, for mental health, you know, they have, people have mental problems, you know, going through issues and stuff like that.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah - yeah. And so, like you said about programming, how has it been with reduced visitation and programming?</br></br>

Caller: Would you say that again?</br></br>

UCI: I said how has, yeah, how has it been for you to have reduced visitation and programming?</br></br>

Caller: It’s been very, it’s been very stressing for me, it’s been very stressing and - and did not get no visits you know, not getting no visits, from nobody, I ain’t get no visits from my family, nothing. It’s very difficult, you know, and I’ve been going through it, you know, I’ve been, I’ve been like, I haven’t, you know, nights I don’t, can’t even sleep, you know, I just be stressed out, you know? 'Cause I'm ready to get up out of this prison, you know?</br></br> 

I’m already mad that, that I, you know, that I’m locked in here, you know, I don’t like, you know, being in prison, I don’t like being behind these walls, you know. It’s - it’s very stressing, it’s not really, it’s not cool being locked in a square box cell, where you barely can move, you know, you got two people, you know, in the cell, you know, and it’s very stressing, you know?</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, and  how have you been coping with the whole crisis?</br></br>

Caller: Not well. I’d say not well, you know I, you know, like I said, I’ve been up and down, you know, I’ve just been going through it, you know I just praying that they release me this month. When they release me I go to my board [unintelligible] board for non-violent case, you know, under three strikes law, hopefully they release me, and let me go home, you know, give me a second chance.</br></br>

I know one thing, I will never come back here ever again. Never, I never come back to prison. I’ll never commit any crime ever again, you know, if I ever getting a second chance to get up out of here, I would never, this is like a nightmare. It’s like living in hell, you know?</br></br>

Everyday drama, is always something going on, is always a difficult time, you know? You know, me myself, I just try to stay out the way, you know I just try to stay to myself, you know that’s the best way I think, be best for me, you know?</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, and so in regards to this whole situation, how would you have made this situation better, in regards to, like, how your facility handled things for COVID? How would you have made it better?</br></br>

Caller: Well, I don’t know how to make it better, 'cause nothing’s better, and I, all I can say is the only thing that can make it better, but for me, I would think about my mom, you know? That’s the only reason why I’ve been living all these years, 25 years, than having to commit suicide or nothing, you know? I’ve been thinking about my mom, you know? She’s been my main goal, the reason why I live, the reason why I struggle everyday to stay alive, and - and hope that getting the release day, on you know, getting out of prison, you know, and that’s, and now my day is coming up, you know and it’s May this, of this month, you know?</br></br>

But for the board, I had the chance of getting out, finally getting this, you know, to set this above me, you know and get this, get me to get my freedom back, you know? I’d better be living on the streets and free, walk, go where I want to go, I ain’t got to have nobody tell me when I can go here, I can go there, or when I’m locked down, I ain’t got to have nobody control me. I could be a free man again, you know?</br></br>

UCI: Of course. And so, I just wanted to rephrase the question. That, that, you answered the, the question that I said good. I just, I was just referring to, like, you know how with, with COVID, certain facilities haven’t handled protocols correctly, so they don’t give out masks or anything like that so I was, I was wondering like -</br></br>

Caller: Oh, okay.</br></br>

UCI: If you, yeah.</br></br>

Caller: Oh yeah, they give out masks, yeah they give out masks here. They do give us masks, that’s one thing they do give us. They give us masks, that’s cool, you know.</br></br>

You know they keep the - the disease from spreading around, it must because I, you know, I got to mask myself, you know, they give them to you so they protect, so we protect each other now, you know, so they, they been, and that’s been a good thing about the prison. They started giving out masks, masks, I mean masks and that’s a good thing to keep the, that COVID-19 virus from spreading. You know, and that’s a good thing, you know?</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, and they don’t give you guys like any cleaning supplies, like any towels to wipe things down, anything to, to remain sanitary?</br></br>

Caller: No. No, you got to go and, you got to go and ask for the cleaning supplies, like disinfectant and stuff like that, and the cleaning, if you don’t, if you don’t have that, if you don’t have that, they, you know, that, that’s a, that’s a risk that you, you around a lot of germs, you could catch, you could catch COVID-19, you know? You get to be around those, you got to ask for disinfectant.</br></br>

They, they do hand it out every now and then, but they very strict on it though, they very strict on disinfectant, giving disinfectant out. You know and, you got to, you got to stay on them, you know, you got to stay on them, and let them know that hey man, I need to clean my house, I need to clean up my area, clean around, I need to have disinfectant to clean the walls and stuff and, like, that, you know soap to wash my hands, you know?</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, and how you, you mentioned your, your mother, how has she and, and other loved ones -</br></br>

Caller: Oh yeah.</br></br>

UCI: Been affected?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, I’m sorry, they want me to get off, they want me to get off the phone, can I call you tomorrow?</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, of course, you can always call 5:00 through 9:00, Monday through Friday.</br></br>

Caller: Okay, thank you.</br></br>

UCI: All right, thank you.</br></br>

Caller: I have to get off the phone because they, they locking, they’re locking the prison up.</br></br>

UCI: All right, thank you.</br></br>
