This story was told by an incarcerated individual at Mule Creek.</br></br>

Caller: Trying to get things coming that we supposed to have. Basically, it was actually harder during the pandemic, I could say. And yeah, but I'm just trying to hang in and just stay positive as I'm in here.</br></br>

I just want to see it, you know, get better overall for everybody, you know. Everybody and they families, and hoping that this is just over with. I know they opened up a little bit, so I see when I watch TV, these people going to concerts and things like that.</br></br>

But I heard about another outbreak in L.A. I'm not sure if it's, you know, true or not. But, I just pray that my family's safe I could say. And it has been quite an experience being in prison, though.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, the pandemic has definitely done a lot of damage. I agree. How has the vaccination situation been like at your facility?</br></br>

Caller: I actually got vaccinated. A lot of people have been vaccinated, both of them. You know, a couple of them refused. Like the COs, they don't want to take the vaccination or whatever. But you can't force nobody to do something like that. But I feel everybody would be safer if everybody would just comply with the rules that are set, I would say, you know?</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, I do agree with you.</br></br>

Caller: Hello?</br></br>

UCI: Hi, I'm here, I'm here.</br></br>

Caller: [unintelligible] A little hard [unintelligible] I do think [unintelligible] and get it. [unintelligible] is like that.</br></br>

UCI: In trouble? What do you mean by in trouble?</br></br>

Caller: Just like, you know, situation [unintelligible] mental breakdowns and things like that, you know? Just trying to just stay out of the way and just make sure I'm able just to get home. I got a couple more years until I'm released.</br></br> 

So, I just try to stay on the right path as I could say, but during the pandemic it makes it a little bit hard, you know? Or like certain things that we can't do that we used to be able to do and that makes time easier. As in getting into groups and I could say like the yard programs, and things like that, you know. It's to a limit, I could say.</br></br>

Especially like when the pandemic was really in the prisons, it was pretty hard. We wasn't going outside like that. And it's stressful. [unintelligible] situation. Now we can, you know? Fighting our cases and things like that and just trying to get out of prison. So, it's hard.
