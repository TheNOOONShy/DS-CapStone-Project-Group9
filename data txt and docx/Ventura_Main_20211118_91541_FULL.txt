This story was told by a person incarcerated at Ventura County Main Jail.</br></br>

Caller: Well, do you know what COVID means? Why it was called COVID and the 19th? Because people got it wrong. Do you know what Corona means? If you don't, [unintelligible].</br></br>

UCI: You can go ahead and tell me what you think it means.</br></br>

Caller: Well, I'm going to read it out of the dictionary for you, okay? Because that's what you didn't do, and I'm not saying anything bad about you, but that's the problem with people. People are not reading. And, so, the whole time that the news and everybody, doctors, they didn't even tell us what corona means. That's why everybody's walking around with a mask on their face because they – they know – it – it was all wrong.</br></br> 

Airborne, air means aliens obstruct respiratory, okay? And, so, that's why – do you know who's talking to us in our ear from above in space, our heavenly bodies? Our heavenly things above us? The guardian angels [unintelligible] it's in everybody's holy bible. [unintelligible] the finger, the one finger pointed at the ground, the one finger with the holy one, the Father and the Son; okay?</br></br> 

When you point it down at the ground, you point at the [unintelligible] that you're pointing at the ground to where you're going for disobeying the Lord God; okay? It's word. That's what the God Father hat was. It was God the Father the Most High; right? The head of the body. And, so, you got to look at the definition to God.</br></br>

It's going to say superior being. But anyways, about these other stars in the sky [unintelligible] the stars. And, so, we're one body with – with how many [unintelligible] and it's in everybody's holy bible and they haven't seen them, so they didn't know what Corona means. I'm going to read it to you right now; okay?</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, okay.</br></br>

Caller: Are you there? And, so, my point is anything you see on the news and doctors tell you, don't believe them. Look it up yourself because they're going to give you the wrong information. For instance, when you walk around on the street, people have masks on. But somebody could come up and hurt us and – and tell us, and nobody could ever I.D. them because nobody gets sick from breathing on each other.</br></br>

We get sick from our heavenly beings above us. It's in Psalms 8 verse 3 and 5 [unintelligible], okay? But here – here's the definition to Corona; okay? And I'm going to give it correct here because it wasn't the vaccine, so I'm going to test you – not test you. I'm going to ask you do you know what's in the vaccine?</br></br>

UCI: I do not.</br></br>

Caller: Okay. And that's a fair answer. And, so, the reason why you didn't know is because everybody has smartphones. God gave us all smartphones so we could be smart and – and be healthy; right? But nobody's even looking up anything; right? And, so, nobody's here – here goes the definition of Corona; okay?</br></br>

UCI: I'm sorry to interrupt you, but I would prefer if you had a COVID-related story to tell me about, like, the conditions –</br></br>

Caller:I do. I do.</br></br>

UCI: - the conditions where you're [unintelligible] –</br></br>

Caller: I do. I'm – I'm getting – I am. I'm getting to that condition, but you have to know what COVID means because everybody doesn't know what COVID means. You got to tell the world what – what Corona means first; okay? I'm going to read it to you; okay? Right here. Can you hear me?</br></br>

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: Man - okay. Man is not doing everything. That was [unintelligible] the 2nd Thessalonians Chapter 2 verse 3 through 12, but here goes. I see my things above me. My boss is my guardian angels [unintelligible] and you can, too, but you have to repent they said.</br></br>

So, look, here's the definition to Corona. It's a crown-like part structure or process, a luminous – number two, a luminous circle around one of the heavenly bodies. Do you understand what the luminous circle around one of the heavenly bodies mean?</br></br>

UCI: I do not.</br></br>

Caller: Miss? Okay. And, so, that's why you didn't understand because you didn't look it up, so it's your fault as it's the news fault –</br></br>
