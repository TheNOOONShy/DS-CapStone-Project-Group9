I pray this letter finds you well, in the best spirits as well as health. I’m well, thank you for asking. I received your interesting letter and would love to help. Just one question: How did you get my number and name? I’m interested, please let me know.</br></br> 

Now as for me having or contracting the coronavirus 19, I have not, or do I know anyone that has it? I have plenty of war stories where I’ve been affected by the pandemic. Our yards are locked down and we have no school classes, full classrooms, big main yard, library, church, or activities. We are locked in our cells. This has affected behaviors and bad attitudes. No working, just basic jobs, kitchens and little maintenance, janitors as well.</br></br> 

I am in the SAP program, eight women for two hours a day. And school, a GED of our teacher showing up and mine has only been here one time in three months. We receive homework packets.</br></br> 

So, all together the prison is less than 2,000 women. They just started bringing counties to the prison and closed a mini security prison to live here. So, women are coming. It's just a matter of time, we all catch it. I feel at times. I am aware of the new vaccine. Hope we receive it when approved.</br></br> 

The quarantine is two weeks, one cell one person in quarantine and temperature check for two weeks after. We get quarantined if we’re out of the prison longer than I think 12 to 24 hours at least. I was having surgery in Bakersfield, California.</br></br> 

We sit two at a table in the dining hall. And have yard three times a week and two times a night a week. One hallway at a time. There’s four hallways per unit. Most rooms have eight to six women. 505 medical unit and 506 EOP has less women in their cells. Four to six women, some one or two per unit.</br></br> 

It is here but I have to say we haven’t had a pandemic yet. Very blessed and thankful for the warren. I know there's more at CIW and people have even died. San Quentin the same. Not being careful, I guess.</br></br>

A lot of women have been released because of corona, as you know. I haven’t been a lucky one for early release.</br></br> 

If you send me some questions maybe I can be more helpful.</br></br> 

I don’t have family that’s been affected either. Thank God. But a lot of women have. It's been terrible for them.</br></br> 

Well, I'll close in hope I kinda helped. If you need more information, please ask questions I can easily answer. Happy holidays!</br></br> 

P.S. If you want me to call me let me know.
