This story was told by a person incarcerated at San Quentin.</br></br>

Caller: And you're in the cell by yourself on the bunk, boom, because the cells are tiny.</br></br>

So eventually the- within a week, the- the plant operations engineers came through to start putting power to the cells because the guys have little chargers and things to- for batteries, for CD players, to listen to radio. There was no TV, there was no nothing. And a lot of guys, a lot of us, you got to have a TV, that's how you see the world.</br></br>

Otherwise, you got concrete walls, and the cells are tiny. The cells are four and a half feet wide by 10 feet. And you got two guys in there, and it's rough.</br></br>

But this was just single cell, which I understand now that they've started moving people back. The viruses burn through, there's less cases, so a lot of guys are now still single cells. They gutted the chapels, they pulled all the pews out of the Catholic chapel, all the benches are out and the seats and everything, and they took all the churches apart and made them bed for COVID.</br></br>

They did the same thing to PIA, which is the Prison Industry Authority. That's the mattress factory and the furnish factory that guys are work in, they gutted the whole thing in space for beds. The gym, which was for recreation.</br></br>

They set up tents on the lower yard that look like field hospital tents, big ones big like- put guys in there, just so they can spread people out because they've known for years that this is- there's no way for social distancing. I mean, you can't even keep a social distance from your cellmate or your cellie or cell next door. If you go to the bars, there's bars, there's not doors, and that thing is bars it’s wide open out into- And you got a guy you could- if you could, you could just reach around and grab his hand, let alone be socially distanced from a guy in your cell.</br></br>

So if he's got it and you don't, well, you're there- you're quarantined with him. It's- it's San Quentin was built for single cell. It was built for like a maximum of a couple of thousand.</br></br>

And when I got there in 2010, there was over 6,000 people. They had people in the gym, they had people triple bunk. Well, once they get away with it long enough to have two guys in a cell, that's- they welded the bunks in.</br></br>

They have two guys in a cell that was built for one. That's it- that becomes normal. Do that for a decade and it's well, it's just what we do.</br></br>

Well, it's unhealthy and it's- it's wrong. But that was kind of a digression from the COVID but that was absolutely what made it spread like wildfire. And people were washing, they were giving us little bottles of sanitizer thing, but not much.</br></br>

And once we hit quarantine, it was basically “good luck.” The doctor might come by, you know. The nurses did come by every day, and they check temperature with a gun, and they'd have to go there and they, you know- and they would check your- your blood oxygen by putting the thing on your finger. So I mean, there was that.</br></br>

They did- medical was doing everything they felt they could do- that everything that custody would let them do. But- and they're saying “you gotta get these guys out of here.” And custody is saying “sorry, we-” now they never have there- there's nothing to- as precedent to tell them how to operate, to tell them how to do this.</br></br>

So they were making decisions by the hour. And you had guys from death row, I heard- I was- when I was in the clinic. I heard the nurses talking and saying, “Yeah, a couple of guys came in from death row, one of them was saying he didn't want any treatment for COVID.</br></br>

"It's my way out of here.” So what is that: suicide by COVID? And the nurse and the doctor that were talking, just talking, chatting about it, we're saying, “Man, that's terrible.” While the guards are saying, “well, that's what happens, oh, well,” until some of their numbers started to die, too.</br></br>

So I don't know what the total number is at this point, but I know that it's more than 25 that we've lost. And most of them have been inmates, but there have been a few guards, a sergeant. And it's a shame, these guys didn't have to go like that.</br></br>

But prison is hard on health anyway. And if you don't eat well, or you don't stay active, or whatever, you put yourself in a compromised position. It was the worst disease that I've ever encountered, I wouldn't wish it on anybody.</br></br>

And the goofy thing now is I want to get back from this, I want to- I've got the antibodies, I know I've got em. But I cannot donate blood to people who are doing plasma, because I've been in prison. If you've been in prison more than 72 hours, you have to be out more than a year.</br></br>

So they're missing, they're missing out on, you know, some few thousands of guys that have paroled out of prison in the last 90 days, that could be giving COVID- giving plasma, they probably would be willing to do that. So who knows. It's just- it's just the insanity of it all.</br></br>

But it was- it was really bad. And there are guys there that were very sick too, they're still there. Now, I know that there's some efforts to try to get some- not early parole, there's never really been early parole.</br></br>

As a lifer, you have to go to the board. So hopefully, I know, in my case, it helped, that COVID was in fact, active. I went April third.</br></br>

So March 18 is when they locked us down. So I think that had- played, you know, had to play in something. 65, you know, that's the age.</br></br>

So all of this in there. But there are guys that- that got exposed, that got tested positive that hasn't- it hasn't affected. So how do we advocate for these guys? There was a huge amount of people that were marching on San Quentin and I have photos on the phone that people have sent me, and big banner that said Incarcerated Lives Matter, which I think is very cool.</br></br>

You know, and just for us sitting in- in the quarantine with the guards going “Sorry, I got nothing to tell you.” “Well, when are we going back to our-” “Well, I got nothing to tell you. Just shut up and and hang loose. We'll figure it out.”</br></br>

Meanwhile, you know, but just knowing that those people were out there doing that. It was a big deal. We had a couple of guys who went on a hunger strike, to try to prove a point.</br></br>

And I'm talking 10 day hunger strike.
