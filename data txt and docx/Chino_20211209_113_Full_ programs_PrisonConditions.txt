Dear UCI student,</br></br>

Thank you so much for giving me the opportunity to reconnect with the “free society“ I only hope that my words will further educate the public, about my and my fellow inmates experience during Covid 19. In regards to what it has been like, for the most part, we are quarantined to our buildings with access to a small yard. We do not have any “outside” programs; AA, NA. The education program is limited to a certain number of students each day.</br></br>


Our movements are limited & we eat all our meals in our buildings. We get “nose swab“ tester every Monday & when somebody test positive, we go on full quarantine. I have taken the time to work on my parole packet and writing short stories. I miss getting visiting privileges. I understand that the institution is just doing the best they can do during unusual times. I appreciate their tireless efforts.</br></br>

In regards.
