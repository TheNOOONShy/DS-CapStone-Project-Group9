This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Kern Valley.</br></br>

In November of 2019, I went out to court in Orange County. When I got back to prison, I got so sick and thought I was going to die, refusing medical. I just wanted it to be all over, that I would go to sleep and not wake up. How I wished that would had happen.</br></br> 

After all, who wants to die in prison? And who wants to spend the rest of their lives in prison.</br></br>

I’ve come to terms with myself, and have accepted the fact that prison is where I’ll die. But anyways, after the months of being so sick, I finally found out through lab work that I had come in contact with COVID. As I reflect back and look at all the beautiful folks that lost their lives really saddens me.</br></br>

It’s been crazy here in prison during this pandemic, so much has changed and wonder if we will ever get back to normalcy. Even though I had COVID, I still took the vaccine because I am at a higher risk than most people due to my age medical problems. Even when they come around asking if I wanna get tested, I never refuse. I’d rather be safe than sorry.</br></br>

Just last week they started contact visiting, and it sucks. I don’t get visits, but I hear it all the time, they get one hour contact on Saturdays and one half hour on video on Sundays. No food, two bottles of water and that’s it. I feel for those families who travel hundreds of miles only to give their love ones one hug at the beginning and one hug at the end.</br></br>  

That’s what they get for one hour. That breaks my heart.
