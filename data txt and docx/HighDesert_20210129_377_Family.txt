I keep in contact with family through phone calls and letters. Though it's hard, I can't hug them or see them. But that's the consequence of sin. I'm truly grateful for all the love and support they've been showing me since day one of my calamity. </br></br>

As I look around in my cell, I can honestly say that I'm blessed by God through my family. I cope by just doing the best I can to better myself by reading the Bible and getting involved in the self-help packets. I keep some of their pictures up on the wall for motivation when I have difficult days. In all good conscience, I can't be lazy or complacent on my rehabilitative efforts when they have done nothing but show me their love and support.
