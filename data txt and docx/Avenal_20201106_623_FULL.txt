This story was told by a person incarcerated at Avenal.</br></br>

Caller: Well, it's been out of control, honestly. Like there's so many people that are just - well, there's no social distancing here whatsoever.</br></br>We're in a dorm setup and they expect us to - for us to be safe and make everyone else safe and be considerate of others. There is no possible way to social distance in here. Like our beds are three feet apart. We use the same restrooms. We use the same phones. You know, everything we - we have in here, we have to all use right after one another and there's no possible way of preventing yourself from getting the virus.</br></br>And there's been several people here that have been - have - that have been diagnosed with the virus.</br></br>
UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>Caller: More than, I think, 80 percent of the prison has tested positive, and it's just - it's not stopping. It's just people are still testing positive. It's not under control. Nothing seems to be working.</br></br>UCI: And what is - like what is troubling you or concerning about the situation to you?</br></br>Caller: I feel like the - I feel like officers aren't being considerate of the inmates. They have a lot more better medical attention than we do. I feel like officers come in here without their masks on, they go home every day. There - there's no possible way of us bringing it in because we do not leave. So with that being the - the officers go home every night or - or in the daytime, what - and they bring it into us.</br></br>So them getting their tests only once a week, the day after they test, they could just bring it right back in the very next day; you know? So I don't know how - how they, you know, this is - that's why it's out of control is because the officers have - are bringing it in. I don't know how to - what else to say about that.</br></br>UCI: And, so -  What would you - what would make the situation at your facility better?</br></br>Caller: Cutting down the population in here; you know? Like getting rid of people that are close to going home. Just, you know, most of us have - I myself am going home in days, so -</br></br> UCI: Oh, wow.</br></br>Caller: - to make me just fin out - finish out my sentence is crazy whenever there's people that are - done the whole sentence, have no write-ups, you know, have been on good behavior, I feel like they should be considerate and move them out to make it more social distancing in here; you know? The less numbers, the, you know, the more you can keep six feet away from each other. You know, maybe they can maintain it a little bit better, more medical attention for the ones that are going to need it.</br></br>I - you know, I feel like that's maybe one thing that they can do to - to help out. Cells would be - if we had cells that - that would be a lot better also, but we're not able to - this is a dorm setup. When you come to a level one or level two prison, that's the bads of it. So when something like this happens, we cannot be in our cell and locked down and be away from others until we get rid of it. Right here, there's - in my - inside my dorm, there's six bunks.</br></br>So there's - there's normally 12 people in there. Two racks they emptied out to try to social distance, but so there's two - there's three people that sleep within two feet away from me; okay? So I don't understand, like, and also, two of us tested positive and the two that tested negative never got moved out. They put them right back in the same dorm with us. So I don't understand.</br></br>Like, I feel that they're at risk because I myself tested positive, but the ones that didn't test positive, why would - I don't understand why they would put them right back in the same dorm two feet away from us and put them at risk of getting it.</br></br>UCI: How was COVID-19 handled by your facility at the beginning of the outbreak?</br></br>Caller: Very poorly. Like I said, it - it went from yard - there's six yards here. It went from yard to yard to yard to yard, and I think our yard was the hit hardest and - and first.</br></br>I know a guy here that, you know, that was a kitchen worker that he was a lifer himself and he couldn't risk getting a write-up, and he had tested negative, but they - he had to still go to work knowing that there was positive people and - and the risk of getting it, the virus, but they - he had to go to work still to not get a write-up because he's trying to go home to his family, and he ended up dying.</br></br>You know, he ended up passing away getting the virus, you know, and now his - his family's, you know, suffering because of it because he was trying to go home to his family and they still made him go to work.</br></br>UCI: Is it being handled differently now?</br></br>Caller: Not really so much differently.</br></br>I feel like they're - they - they're letting PIA work because I feel like it benefits the prison because they make millions of dollars a year off - off PIA here, but they aren't - aren't letting vocations run, so - which is education. They're not letting that run, but I feel - because they're getting paid a - for vocations no matter what. But the PIA, if PIA isn't running, which is the - the business they have running in our yard, then they don't get money.</br></br>They're - you know, they're lost - lost out on all - millions of dollars a year. So I don't know why they would let free staff come in and out and be around our inmates, which inmates can bring it back to the - to the building to 250 people in each building.</br></br>UCI: Mm-hmm. If possible, could you tell us about - could you tell us month-by-month how the situation has changed at your facility?</br></br>Caller: At first it was no yard. We would - we're in our racks in dorms. They give us - they do give us masks and stuff, but, you know, like I said, the cops - the cops got tired of wearing them, the inmates got tired of wearing these masks, you know, because it feels like it's not going to stop it anyways here.</br></br>We're in a building with recycled air. It's not like we have windows open; you know? It's - it's a prison. We're not supposed to have windows open; you know? They're supposed to be secure and safe from people escaping, so it's like a - it's like a sealed box; you know? How is the virus supposed to escape if we're in a sealed box? You know, prison is no place for a pandemic; you know? And I feel that a lot of people are doing good trying to go home, and if they see people programming and been down 25 years and 60 years old, barely, you know, only a couple years left of their life, I feel like they should release them.</br></br>Why would you make them sit in a box and that's pretty much like a death penalty; you know?</br></br>UCI: And how has COVID-19 situation at your facility affected your loved ones?</br></br>Caller: It's - it's affected them really - I mean, this whole last - I haven't seen my kids and my wife for - since November of last year.</br></br>So about a year now I have not seen them. You know, my kids are suffering. You know, they want to see their dad. My mom, I've lost family members since this pandemic has started. Haven't got to see them. And, you know, it - it's rough for us, too; you know? We're on good behavior, we're trying to do whatever we can to go home to our families and we can't even see them; you know?</br></br>No virtual - like it would be nice if we could see them virtually even like, you know, on a Skype or like a FaceTime or something that they could provide for us to do that to say hello to our kids and stuff. Like I feel that my kids maybe even feel like I abandoned them because, you know, they - they're - how am I going to explain to the 5- and 6-year-old that they can't see me? When they ask to see me, how can - that's not right to tell your kids that they - that they can't.</br></br>You know?</br></br>UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>Caller: They're probably like, well, why can't I see my dad; you know?</br></br>UCI: And what has it been like for you to have reduced visitations and programming? I know you've told me a little bit about the programs and stuff, but, you know, how - how has that been like for you?</br></br>Caller: It's - it's been a struggle.</br></br>Like I said, it hasn't been as bad for me. I feel because like I said, I'm - I go home soon. I go home in about a week. So I feel that it's not as bad for me, but some people that live very far from their families aren't going home for several years, it takes a bigger toll on them. But I know it's for a good reason to try to keep it out as much as possible, but it's not going to stay out as long as the - I feel like the officers and free staff and nurses, they have to go in and out of this prison every day.</br></br>So that's not going to keep it out. Not giving us visits.</br></br>UCI: Right. And how have you been coping with the crisis so far?</br></br>Caller: Well, now it just feels like it's the new norm, honestly, but it - it's - it's tough. It takes a toll on you. It's a lot of stress.</br></br>We're limit - before we'd be able to be outside from 8:00 to 9:00 at night - from 8:00 in the morning until 9:00 at night. Now we're getting an hour and a half of yard a day, if that, because if a new test positive - if someone tests positive, then they cancel the yard. It's - it's a - people moving in and out the buildings, it's - it's, you know, it has affected me.</br></br>And I don't even know how to deal with it anymore but just hope, you know, the virus doesn't come back and get it a second time.</br></br>UCI: Mm-hmm. And what else is there that you want to give in your testimony? Something that -</br></br> - that maybe you might want to say in the next couple of seconds or, you know -</br></br> Caller: I think that's pretty much it.</br></br>UCI: Okay. Well, the time is now 6:36. I want to thank you very much for participating in PrisonPandemic. I want you to just remain calm and remain safe. You're going home soon. And just keep yourself and everyone else around you safe and healthy. And I wish you the best of luck; okay?</br></br>Caller: All right. Thank you very much.</br></br>UCI: Thank you. I'm ending this call and this recording. Thank you.</br></br>Caller: All right. Thank you.
