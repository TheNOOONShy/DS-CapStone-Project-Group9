This letter was written by a person incarcerated at High Desert.</br></br>

The COs brought the virus here and they went around trying to say inmates were the cause for it being here. Without being anything positive to do, people have been getting into fights, stabbing, and substance abuse. Not being able to see our families and loved ones have been a big distress to me and to my family.</br></br> 

Being in this place while a pandemic is going on, with me being so close to home, makes me feel like it's a constant death threat. That's waiting to check me out like that sign I told you guys about.</br></br>

And that's very stressful, not knowing if I'm going to make it home to my family. I don't feel safe at all in here with this virus or with these corrupt COs. It's been hard to try to be positive. And I'm pretty much a positive guy. I don't be going out getting into trouble.</br></br>

It's been so stressful on all incarcerated individuals. Some of us have to do things we knew we shouldn't do to survive these hard times. Things that will delay release dates, so yeah it's been a real drought on things around these parts.</br></br>

Some new reforms need to be seriously made to help all incarcerated people no matter the crimes or conditions of crimes. How can we be incarcerated for our crimes that's not sentence to life sentences and end up getting life sentences because of our bondage that wasn't sentence to death?</br></br>

Thank you for taking time to listen to my story about our trials here at High Desert State Prison. And I say our trials because I speak on behalf of us here at HDSP, the voice or the voices.
