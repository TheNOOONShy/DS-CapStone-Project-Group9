This story was told by a person incarcerated at Chino.</br></br>

UCI: So, like, I don’t think I heard you say anything about the vaccines from what you were telling me. So, how has the vaccination situation at your facility been like?</br></br> 

Caller: Right. Got it. Well, I personally had my vaccine while I was in the LA county jail system. But then once I mainlined to here, came to Chino, I already had my shot. But they have offered it. They have been giving the vaccination out to different various people that actually would want it. I think it's still on a voluntary basis.</br></br> 

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br> 

Caller: You know. So, but yeah, and then one guy in particular he had his COVID or CDC, you know, the card that verifies you’ve been vaccinated and all that.</br></br> 

UCI: Yeah.</br></br> 

Caller: So, but yeah, yeah.</br></br> 

UCI: Gotcha. Okay. And so what about the - how has COVID - how’s the COVID situation in your facility affected your your loved ones? Like such as your family, or anyone or any incarcerated individuals that, you know, are your friends or maybe your family in there too. So like what about that?</br></br> 

Caller: Right.</br></br> 

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br> 

Caller: Right. Yeah, you know, of course there is concern, there is concern on health issues. You know, for me personally, mine of course goes out to my girl, my girlfriend. She has asthma. she’s had bronchial issues, you know. She’s a frequent cigarette smoker.</br></br> 

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br> 

Caller: So, you know - but it concerns me, you know? I’ve been able to - one of the benefits about being incarcerated for the past eight months is I’ve been able to quit smoking, you know, cigarettes, you know. So, but that concerns me, as far as my thing with her. Because I mean, it's like, it has a - mainly the attack goes on primarily on the bronchial right, if I’m not mistaken.</br></br> 
 
UCI: Mm-hmm. Yeah.</br></br> 

Caller: So, but yeah. I hope that answers your question.</br></br> 

UCI: Yeah - yeah, it did of course. And to go back to another question, you know, what has it - you mentioned your girlfriend, has she been able to visit you, and has she been able to visit you? What has it been like for reduced visitation?</br></br> 

Caller: No. Oh no. 'Cause I think the visitation had been - had been been, that program had been modified as well. So, there was no visitation available because of the quarantine. My understanding is that the entire prison was pretty much quarantined and then eventually isolated and all.
