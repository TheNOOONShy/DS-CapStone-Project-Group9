You want to know the truth about this pandemic and prisons. We are last on the list for anything, and they try to hide everything. I got COVID in February of 2021 and they took us to the gym.</br></br>

We were housed with a bunch of other men who were sick. But they never bothered to take a second test, because there were a lot of false positives. The prison hired a medical company to come and deal with the COVID-related medical.</br></br>

They took our temperatures and blood pressure and asked if anything was wrong. I told them numerous times that I felt bad, and still do have problems with breathing, but they only wrote it down and did nothing.</br></br>

CDCR hired them solely for the purpose of liability. The medical company did absolutely nothing for anyone. Once we spent 14 days in the gym, we were brought back to the cell and put in there with people who weren't sick. Then they got sick.</br></br>

Mule Creek State Prison made an effort to get everyone sick so they could resume the program. All they care about was not having to work. If you have ever worked, or observed a day in prison, COs do not like to work!</br></br>

The one thing that they refused to shut down was the forced labor that they say is a program under the name of PIA. PIA supplies most of the supplies to CDCR and other state agencies. They found a way to keep making money out of the state after they retire.</br></br>

The salaries these people pull is disgusting and the workers get 30 cents to 1 dollar and they break their backs working. They did not shut that down.
