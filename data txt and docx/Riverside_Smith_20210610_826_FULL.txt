<em>This story was told by a person incarcerated at Larry D. Smith Correctional.</br></br></em>

UCI: And what has the COVID situation been like at your facility?</br></br>

Caller: It's bad because they got too many people in here and they're not cleaning up. We use one thing that we clean with. They spray it on the tables or the phones, just one solution, and they don't use bleach or disinfectant. They leave it to us.</br></br> 

And when I go to court they pack us in there like sardines. Every seat has to be filled, to be three to a seat, and it's not six feet apart. I have to get my stuff, hold on. Hello?</br></br>

UCI: Hello.</br></br>

Caller: Hello?</br></br>

UCI: Hello.</br></br>

Caller: Hello, yes.</br></br>

UCI: Hi.</br></br>

Caller: Okay, and when you're on the bus it's horrible. It's, like, there's no separation. I'd say about two feet apart, if that. And then, there's this holding cells to hold you for court, they don't have anybody in there, the court, to see you or talk to you but they want to pack you in there like about, I'm going to say, it's supposed to be three people in there but they put 10 people in the cell.</br></br> 

And nobody's six feet apart, they don't have masks available. All the masks that they have are dirty, are nasty. This is how it is at the jail I'm at now, at Banning Road Camp.</br></br>

UCI: Is that the Larry D. Smith Correctional?</br></br>

Caller: Yes, that's it.</br></br>

UCI: Okay, yeah, and how has the COVID, how has that been like for you to have, like, reduced visitations and programming?</br></br>

Caller: Excuse me?</br></br>

UCI: How has it been like for you to have, like, reduced visitations and programming?</br></br>

Caller: Oh, we didn't have no – they don't have any programming here for us. They only give us rec at, like, 6:00 in the morning or 5:00 in the morning. They don't let us have rec in the afternoons when they should. You know, because it's COVID, should wait until it's warmer, but they don't do that.</br></br> 

Any time I write a kite I write grievances to the sergeants, they never give or they don't reply. I've been [crosstalk] here for about –</br></br>

UCI: I'm sorry, what is a kite? What's a kite?</br></br>

Caller: That's a piece of paper that they give. It's an inmate request form. It's a kite, you write what you need on there, like I need to see you, and they haven't given me no news. I asked for new socks, they haven't given me any new socks.</br></br> 

I asked for new sheets, they don't give us new sheets. Give us dirty sheets. The shirt I'm wearing is stained up right now. There, like, excuse my French, but there's cum stains on all of the sheets that they give you. You know, they put everything in a big washing machine and they wash it all with not good detergent, so you get recycled clothes that don't match up.</br></br> 

They make you get naked and come out of the cell to change your clothes.</br></br>

And they don't let you keep anything. They pretty much [unintelligible] over four times since I've been here.

UCI: Oh wow.</br></br>

Caller: I have to go to court in the morning and I got to go to court in shackles and be shackled from my waist all the way down to my feet and back up to my waist. And they're tight so I can't breathe. I'm a hundred and [unintelligible] pounds, 6'2", so it's very difficult to, you know, walk in that type of situation.</br></br>

UCI: Mh-hmm. Oh, wow, yeah. How have you been coping with, like, the crisis regarding COVID-19?</br></br>

Caller: They have people come around to your [unintelligible] COVID-19 asking want to get a swab. There's one who's died from taking the Johnson vaccine here. They give you – what else do they give you? They give you some medicine that's been killing people.</br></br> 

Four deaths since I've been here. Forget what it's called. But, figure it out I'll call you guys back and I'll let you know.
