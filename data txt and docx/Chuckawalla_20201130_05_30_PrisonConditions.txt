This story was told by a person incarcerated at Chuckawalla.</br></br>

UCI: Okay, so they’re not really separating the yards in case like one is contaminated?</br></br>

Caller: No. So, my yard for some reason was the only yard that for almost a year didn’t get the virus. The two buildings that they kept regular, they cleared out one of our buildings as the contamination building, you know. I’m making quote fingers as I say this.</br></br>

And as the only yard that didn’t catch COVID for almost a year, they were taking inmates from those other three yards that were contracting the virus and bringing them to this yard. Then they were having officers work that building and then come into one of our buildings to work another shift, a double shift, without decontaminating in any way.</br></br>

Pretty much, I’m almost positive that, you know, I mean, obviously it had to have been the staff that exposed us to it. It's not like I left and went to Walmart and came back. But I’m almost positive it was one of these officers that was pulling a double that came and brought it to my building. You know?</br></br>

UCI: And are the guards also wearing face masks and using hand sanitizer or anything to protect you all, and themselves from COVID?</br></br>

Caller: They’re wearing masks and yeah, I mean, you see them with hand- little bottles of hand sanitizer, but that's - the sanitizer thing has been a standard issue for every correctional officer long before this, this COVID thing. But honestly, there’s a lot more that they can do, you know. The way my building is designed, there’s a secluded area that's upstairs, that they can work from and not have any direct contact with us, and could have kept us a lot safer than the way they did.</br></br>  

UCI: Okay, so what would make the situation at your facility better?</br></br>

Caller: Less inmates. They’re not, they say that they’re socially distancing us. They’re, my - the guy I sleep next to me on both sides of me is no more than, no less than three feet away from me. Not actually six feet apart.-</br></br>

We’re too overcrowded even with the bodies that they just randomly started picking out and sending to other prisons, without righteously, you know, taking us to committee and telling us, “Okay this is what happened.” You know? They just took a couple hundred bodies from every building and said, “You’re going to the prison next door.” But it still wasn’t enough.</br></br> 

UCI: Before they transfer the inmates, are they getting tested?</br></br>

Caller: You know what, I don’t know about that Maybe in the beginning honestly, now they probably are. But in the beginning I don’t think they were. They were just grabbing bodies and taking them.
