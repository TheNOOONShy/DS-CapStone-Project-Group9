Hello PrisonPandemic,</br></br>

May this message find you safe and sound. Thank you for responding back. As for myself, I’m doing fine. I took my two COVID-19 shots even though I never had the virus.</br></br>

As for the treatment of us in these eight man pods, we’re packed in, and that's very reckless of [redacted]. The yard program is run one yard per day, minus the night yard. I am taking care of myself. I understand you don’t provide individual responses.</br></br>

I really need someone to be my foot soldier. You can make it easy to get to know me. I’m on the u-pay app under [redacted]. A little about me, I’m 56 as of March, African American, dreads, very spiritual. I am Muslim, one who submit to one GD.</br></br>

I’ve been incarcerated over 20 years, my zest for love, life, and happiness still run bright. Right now, I’m trying to being life to my case. I was given 25 to life for marijuana in 2012, yet court case has failed to send the abstract of judgement. One that’s produced, I’ll have my freedom.</br></br>

Regardless if you step forward, or help me, I’ll still inform you about the recklessness of this institution.</br></br>

Take good care yourself.
