I’ve been down seven years which means seven years without my two boys.</br></br>

They forgot about me despite all we talk on the phone and write. Taking away visiting is something we must do in order to ensure safety and health. But I was so close to getting my first visit from my kids. It’s like stabbing me in the heart.</br></br>

COVID-19 is destroying my life! I can’t stand being away from my kids all this time. I’ve been going to the mental health crisis bed repeatedly due to the depression caused by lack of communication with my kids.</br></br>

I wish I could be next to all my family and boys. But yeah us mothers are suffering.
