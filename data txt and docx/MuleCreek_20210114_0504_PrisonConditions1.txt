UCI: So what facility are you currently housed at?</br></br>

Caller: Mule Creek State Prison.</br></br>

UCI: What is the current COVID-19 situation at your facility? Is everything okay? What is troubling or concerning you, if there’s anything?</br></br> Caller: No, it’s kinda messed up because they got people housed in the gyms when they’re not supposed to. Like they lock them in at nine o’clock at night. They lock the door and they can’t use the restroom ‘til seven o’clock the next morning, seven or eight.</br></br> They’re housed in dirty conditions. The medical, like ‘cause I’m diabetic, so the medical they come like hour to hour and a half after allotted time for us to get our diabetic shots. So we ended a- I ended up having a diabetic attack and I fell and split my face open. And the cops ended up breaking my ankle in the attack. I guess they were hittin’ on me and pushing on me from what witnesses said. Plus it took ‘em an hour just to come and respond to the alarm when I passed out.
