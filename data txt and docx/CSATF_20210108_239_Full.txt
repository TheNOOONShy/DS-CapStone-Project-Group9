This letter was written by a person incarcerated at SATF (California Substance Abuse Treatment and State Prison).</br></br>

My life is in “imminent danger“ due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This formal letter and complaint is to place on direct notice the committee of, the PrisonPandemic project of UC Irvine, that the COVID-19 pandemic has greatly jeopardize the health, life and safety of California citizens, and throughout the world, and has directly placed my life in “imminent danger.”</br></br>

I am currently incarcerated/subjugated at CSP-SATF, C.FAC. And I have great fears that the president and his administration is not equipped nor capable, and even less prepared to protect my health and safety and therefore my life from the ravages that the COVID-19 (Coronavirus) can inflict on my personal health and life. There’s a plethora of medical and technical evidence that there are many unknown variables related to COVID-19 and how it affects those who are infected, and that everyone can be affected differently.</br></br>

There is also substantial evidence of the unique and specific effects of COVID-19 upon people of African-American descent, therefore I have a higher rate of exposure and life-threatening consequences if and/or I’m exposed to the coronavirus. There are no guarantees that I won’t contract the coronavirus, especially under the dire conditions that prison presents to it’s population.</br></br>

I have been incarcerated/subjugated since July [redacted] 1992, a total of 29 years. I was sentenced to a 28 years to life term for first degree murder w/ use of firearm via a plea deal of a single/multiple victim/victims. I was 18 years of age at the time of the alleged crime/incident and was sentence under a plea agreement/jury trial. I attended my initial parole consideration hearing (IPCH) (non yoph) on January [redacted] 2015, and was given a seven-year denial pursuant to Mary’s law (prop nine).</br></br>

I have completed a plethora of “self-help“ and “educational“ programs since my incarceration/subjugation. This, juxtaposed with an extraordinary amount of time served on my committing offense, and the current life-threatening circumstances that the COVID-19 pandemic presents, in the “imminent danger” that my life is now in. The only humane and logical course to take that would be in the interest of justice and in the pursuit of life sustaining purpose would be the immediate release from prison and placed on supervised parole.</br></br>

The state of California, including many of its prisons, jails, and detention facilities are under public and judicial attack due do you need to release prisoners and detainees solely due to the large scale pandemic of COVID-19 and it’s far-reaching effects on the prisoners health and lives. The CDCR, especially CSP-SATF have failed and/or refused to take the necessary and meaningful steps to protect me (and other prisoners and their staff) from the exposure and ravages of COVID-19(coronavirus).</br></br>

Furthermore, if and when the pandemic hits the CDCR harder than it has, the CDCR is far from equipped nor capable of handling such a broad reaching outbreak, and will not be able to treat all its prison population including its staff. The CDCR has failed and/or refused to set up a much needed monitoring and treatment plan of its prisoner population, and therefore many will suffer and possibly die because we are all in imminent danger to exposure from this death virus called COVID-19.</br></br>

I request immediate release of my person from the custody of the CDCR and placed upon supervised parole within 30 days.
