This story was told by a person incarcerated at Sonoma County Main Adult Detention Facility.</br></br>


UCI: Please give me your testimonial about any aspects you think are important for people to know about the situation of people incarcerated during COVID-19. You can talk about your personal experience or, you know, just what you have been dealing with in terms of, while you were incarcerated and so forth.</br></br>


Caller: For me, I was very fortunate to be where I was because it was so far away from society that we didn’t really feel the impact of COVID-19 for a very long time. Because of the prison’s early precautions, there was no cases in the beginning for the very longest time. I think our very first case came in November, they were prepared.</br></br>


I was on a Level 2 yard and based on my experience, I had more freedom on a Level 2 yard while we were on quarantine and lock down, than I had on a level 4 yard when I just left. They did what they could and everyone mobilized and tried to develop, you know, a way to continue programming while still maintaining social distancing and room capacity.</br></br>


Programs initially were shut down but the schools, the college I attended, they did a wonderful job figuring out how to continue to facilitate learning through correspondence. Although they were not set up for that, they quickly pivoted and were able to come out with classes and provide classes still to the population. So I thought that was commendable on their part.</br></br>


The staff, they did everything they could to help mitigate any of the spread. Although, of course, there were always things that could be debatable. This was something that was unprecedented and they did what they could for our case count there. Although we did end up getting COVID cases and it started to spread a little bit, it wasn’t as bad as some of the other prisons that I heard.</br></br>


I don’t know the statistics, I don’t know the numbers, I don’t know any of that stuff. All I know is from my own experience. Where I was at, it kept getting quarantined, a lot of people kept testing positive and they, you know, the–– especially the Level 2. It was pretty much designed for isolation.</br></br>


So based on the design itself, it’s the old SHU and how they structured the quarantine, it really slowed down the spread of COVID-19. Of course, there’s things where I wish they would be more lenient on, but they did it for our protection and I left there not getting sick.</br></br>


UCI: Wow.</br></br>


Caller: Yeah. I left there. I even got my vaccination, I made it out with my vaccination. I was pretty fortunate to be at the Pelican Bay, on a Level 2 yard.</br></br>


UCI: Was there anything that was really troubling or concerning you at the time? Like I mean, just from the beginning of the pandemic? Like your experience?</br></br>
 
Caller: For me, no. Like I said, I had more freedom, right? When they did open some programming, because initially everything got shut down because they were afraid it was going to spread. Once they saw that nothing was spreading, they opened up a little bit and they allowed us to go to work or go to school. Very limited amount of people.</br></br>


I was in a computer coding program and they gave social distancing. They allowed us to go to class. And there were some programs over there that they started running, social distancing, disinfecting everything, sanitizing everything. Like they had a whole group of people working together to keep the area clean.There were guys that were going up and down the halls sanitizing everything, the walls, every day.</br></br>


Everything was getting sanitized like three times a day over there. They supplied everything we needed. We had gloves, we had masks, we had disinfectant, we had everything we needed. We weren’t short for anything. And I heard that a lot of other places wasn’t that blessed. So my take on it was that I was fortunate to be where I was.</br></br>


UCI: Yeah, so it sounds like, just from an idea from month-to-month when the pandemic started, they shut everything down and as it progressed and you had no cases, they started opening things up? Does that sound about correct?</br></br>


Caller: One more time?</br></br>


UCI: Like in terms of month-to-month, of the situation when COVID started, say March on? They closed and you guys were on lock down but then slowly started to open up?</br></br>


Caller: Uh-huh.</br></br>


UCI: Okay. Just checking to make sure that that’s what happened, just cause we wanted to know about the timeline. How has the COVID-19 situation affected your loved ones?</br></br>


Caller: Well, of course, visitations were shut down, everything was shut down and nobody was allowed to get visits. They did offer free phone calls here and there and that was a blessing because I got to communicate with some family members that I hadn’t spoken to in a very long time.</br></br>


I just went back to court and if I didn’t come back in time, I would’ve been stuck in reception and it would’ve been all bad.  But I came back right in time and that’s when the governor shut down all transportation.</br></br>


So as you can see I was very fortunate because I got to stay in a place where I was very comfortable. If I was stuck in reception at Wasco or something? Living conditions were bad before, terrible over there already, before COVID. I don’t know how it was there afterwards.</br></br>


UCI: Wow.</br></br>


Caller: For me, I was very fortunate to be back at Pelican Bay, in a situation where COVID didn’t really affect that region too hard.</br></br>


UCI: What was it like for you having reduced visitation and programming? I mean at the beginning?</br></br>


Caller: Well, you know, living at Pelican Bay for a very long time, I was very far distance from a lot of family members and my community already, so I wasn’t really getting visits that often. I just started getting some visits. So I was used to not seeing them for like a year. Maybe once a year, I might see them. And that’s just within the last few years I started getting visits. It’s just too far away.</br></br>


I heard now that they started video visiting because right when I left, I heard that they were starting it but I didn’t know anyone that actually went yet because you had to be not in a quarantined block to go to video visitation. So I guess something good came out of the pandemic over there because there was no such thing as video visiting.</br></br>


Before, it was your family who had to come all the way up here to see you, fly or drive. You know, 20 something hours to get up here just to see you. Now there is an opportunity for you to see your family through video visitation, so that something cool that the CDCR pushed state-wide.</br></br>


UCI: That’s great. And how are you able to cope with the crisis in general? Was there any things you did specifically that helped you get through it?</br></br>


Caller: Yeah. Focus on what I needed to do to get out. I stayed in my prayers, I stayed in my work, I stayed in my fellowship and I continued with an attitude of gratitude.</br></br>


UCI: And also, what was the experience of— you’re released, you’re free right now, right?</br></br>


Caller: Yes.</br></br>


UCI: So what was that experience like? Can you talk about, like, when you were incarcerated, the transition period? Getting out?</br></br>


Caller: Yes. So if I was able to cope with that attitude of gratitude while incarcerated and appreciate life and how blessed I was. Now, being free, I am incredibly grateful to be out here in the free world dealing with free world problems.</br></br>


UCI: Can you talk a little bit about the procedure, like that you got vaccinated and then they let you go or? Like what was the process trying to get out of the system? I mean I know that you’re still on parole but––


Caller: I was on quarantine for 13 days before I was released. I received my vaccination shot and we get tested once a week there. I got a negative test, quarantined 13 days, my vaccination shot and then I was released out into society. And then out here, it was the same process. I had to quarantine again out here and eventually I took my second shot while I was out here.</br></br>


UCI: And what month were you released?</br></br>


Caller: February.</br></br>


UCI: OK. Beautiful. So what else is there? Is there anything specific that you want people to know about your experience?</br></br>


Caller: I don’t know. Everything that I just spoke about was what I want people to know about that place because that was my own experience. Not everyone had the same experience that I did, so I can’t speak on behalf of everyone. I just speak on what I observed and experienced.</br></br>


How I saw what happened there, as something that a lot of people had to come together and figure out quickly, how to manage the crisis at hand. I think a lot of people, volunteers, staff, administration, custody, even the incarcerated population had to all come together to figure out how to make this work. And from my own perspective, I think they did a great job.</br></br>


UCI: Great. Is there anything you think they could’ve done better?</br></br>


Caller: Oh, of course. There’s many things I think everyone could’ve done better, right? My part, everyone’s part because it’s only in hindsight that we see certain things. But in the moment, this is what they’re going to implement, this is what we’re gonna do, cause it’s on our part too. To mitigate the spread of the virus we have to do our part too.</br></br>


We can’t just like— big government, we don’t want big government running our lives right? So at the same time, we have to take responsibility as individuals to mitigate the spread of the virus by wearing our masks, social distancing. And if we don’t do that, that’s on us. I prefer not to have big government interfere, right? Same thing with CDCR.</br></br>


I prefer— aye like I’m a man, I'm a grown man, let me— let me work this out. If I get sick, that’s on me. And just like big government is shutting down the whole economy. I see they needed to do that because they felt that was something that was necessary to mitigate the spread of the virus.</br></br>


And it’s a little controlling, but for me, it’s like alright, I see why they’re doing it but I don’t like it. Because I’m a responsible human being. I can’t speak for anyone else, right, and I think that’s why they had to implement what they had to implement. And same thing with the CDCR.</br></br>


UCI: Thank you for participating in PrisonPandemic. I’m gonna end this call recording at 11:22 right now. I appreciate you calling and we will be in touch.</br></br>


Caller: Okay.</br></br>


UCI: Alright, I will talk to you soon.</br></br>


Caller: Alright.</br></br>


UCI: Bye.</br></br>


Caller: Goodbye.
