If I had to say, that’s what it feels like, the first week the news hit I had just proposed to my fiance. Imagine that a week later we are being told we can not see eachother to futher notice and all of a sudden it all comes crashing down. The very next thing was the tissue shortage, you think people outside of prison had it tough imagine not have none at all.</br></br>
 
Safe to say me and my celly at the time had one roll to last us two weeks it wasn’t easy but we made it possible. Just when you think everything will be ok we had an outbreak, it was about six month into the pandemic. No more yard, showers on hold, phone calls limited and dayroom cancelled. What did I do?</br></br>
 
I have already been sentenced why am I being punished. That was the feeling. Will I make it out? I wonder if my family is ok, that was the thoughts.</br></br>
 
I guess all we could do now is pray and watch the news eventually someone donated mask and that was very nice of them however the spread was not slowing. Eventually we all heard someone died and you think it is real. The only thing I could do is write home as much as possible, I worked out to stay healthy and I did not eat much of the food I did not know what to think.</br></br>
 
The extra packages each quarter was a huge help allowed me to have food and be ok. Not seeing the family has no form of expression. It is the hardest thing to deal with everyday walking up not being there because I am here, now I can not even see my family at all.</br></br>
