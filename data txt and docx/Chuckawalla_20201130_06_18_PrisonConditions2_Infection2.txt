This story was told by a person incarcerated at Chuckawalla.</br></br>
Caller: I was sick. My own personal experience was I was sent to central health. It, it was horrible. When I went to central health, it's like being locked up in the hole.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br> 

Caller: You're punished. And you're put in there, and then the food is 10 times worse. You get less portions.</br></br>

So here you are sick with COVID and, or here I am sick with COVID and my body is basically, you know, pushing all the food out. I can't hold much down. They're giving us less portions. It was smaller portions, but it wasn't just that. It was like the nurses, not all of them, there were some good ones.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br> 

Caller: But majority of the nurses were just going through the motions. They didn't even listen to what you had to say. For instance, I got, I was in there Tuesday by Thursday, they had taken, taken X-rays of my chest cause I was coughing so bad.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br> 

Caller: But nobody ever came and told me or diagnosed or, or followed up, that I had ammonia in my lungs. So, Thursday, they took the X-rays. Friday, they made me move. I had all my property. They make you pack all your property up, which is heavy.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br> 

Caller: Bulky. And here I have ammonia in my lungs, and they're making me move across what they call the oval room. Which is a good distance.</br></br> 

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br> 

Caller: So, I didn't think nothing of it. I just moved and did what I was told. That, that evening, I felt okay, but by, so that was Thursday. Friday, I started deteriorating. By Sunday, my oxygen level was falling down to 83 percent, and I had 103.5 temperature.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br> 

Caller: They sent me out to the hospital. I spent seven days in the hospital, where they pretty much saved my life.</br></br> 

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br> 

Caller: And then, they - on the seventh day, they discharged me with certain conditions. I had to, they had to check my blood sugar levels because of all the steroids they were giving me. My blood sugar levels were really high. And they also had, they were supposed to monitor me through the night for my oxygen levels.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br> 

Caller: So, I came back to the prison, and none of that happened. Even though I repeatedly told the nurses that this was the condition.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: This is what, this is the problem. And they didn't listen. Instead, they sent me back here to D-11, the quarantine building.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br> 

Caller: And I was dizzy. And then they put me on an upper bunk, and I tried to talk to the officers. The officers were really cool about it. They let me sit on the lower bunk.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br> 

Caller: But it was just the fact that they, by the rules, that I had to be on an upper bunk. I was really dizzy.</br></br> 

UCI: Yeah.</br></br> 

Caller: I didn't get my blood sugar levels checked until Wednesday, but I pushed it. I had to push it and push it and push it.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br> 

Caller: Until finally, I had to go to one of the head nurses, and they, they basically got me into medical and got me, got my blood sugar levels checked. 'Cause it, it just seemed like it was a fiasco.</br></br>

I don't think that you should be moving people when they're extremely sick like that.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah.
