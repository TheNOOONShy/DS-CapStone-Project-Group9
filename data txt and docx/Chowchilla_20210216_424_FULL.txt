I have had the COVID-19 going on 3 separate times. The first was Nov of 2019, second Dec 26-2020 and (just this a.m.) my sense of smell/taste has left me again.</br></br> 
 
These are propagated informational news being provided by the CDCR/CCWF regarding the exposure, guidelines, staff administrating news (promptly) cleaning supplies being provided, vitals being examined correctly before/after COVID-19. Transferring inmates during pandemic.</br></br> 
 
Exposure has been real at CCWF – based on CCWF administration not sticking to daily – early morning entrances being screened for high temps etc. When it began in March 17 here at CCWF – The entrance was stationed w/ temperature takes – this lasted 1 month. And disappeared. Then officers began not wearing their masks at all – coming to work wearing the fabric – alligators. Gators! Or not at all.</br></br> 

Guidelines were present and ignored while inmate population was doomed from the beginning – inmates were given cloth made face masks (fun within) these prison walls? Made out of regular pants materials of non-approved quality from anywhere? Issued 3 at a time with no possible ways to thoroughly clean them after use? Issued 9 total from March 17 to Dec 1. Ten months later when the 2 officers 1 nurse 1 correctional officer passed it to inmates within a 10 day period – (once) 700 inmates had caught it w/ bogus facial masks – and passed it (m/o) all the others they socialized with?</br></br>

Contracted COVID-19 inmates were relocated in all types of weather conditions with all of their belongings and were told DON'T PACK you’ll only be there for a couple days – you’ll came back to your own room – once cleaned. NOT. Inmates that left first listened to C.O’s say – and had ALL of their everything destroyed. Trashed, discarded into trash bins – without documentation of the discarded items. So COVID-19 inmates are totally exposed and some don’t have family to replace their necessities!</br></br>

In January towards end – COVID-19 news letter created, Feb early week another news letter created. Inaccurate information!</br></br>

Test given listed as 60% accurate. Nose test. Yet rapid test given takes 15 minutes for results!</br></br>

Various CCFW officials advertising we have been given access to bleach, Saniguard, facial masks? Never! No diluted bleach offered nor supplied. I know because I’ve (grieved) 602 this issues for the past 6 months. Still no Saniguard supplied to inmate population while staff uses it.  No hard sanitizer to any inmates? Bar soap is issued at 1 bar in a 3 wk period in 515. Anti-bacterial soap to inmates isn't enough to last a good 5 days with rooms having 8-5 inmates in room? Inmates ADD water to stretch anti bacterial properties into lasting longer???</br></br>

Relocated inmates w/ COVID-19 left their rooms and placed into the cell that COVID-19 inmates already lived in w/out cleaning agents, electricity, (phones), lights to operate inside rooms. It had NO ventilation! Showers weren't cleaned. Beds literally had an infected inmate leave 1 hour before my arrival. I lived w/2 inmates who had been cleared to return to general population? Only things taken once declared infected was Tylenol, Pedialyte, Ceapol - throat drops No extra vitamins, no extra fruits w/ vitamin C, portions of food went from 4oz into 1oz on paper trays?</br></br>

Portion slots are smaller then regular food trays. Inmates used portable fans to circulate COVID-19 in rooms down halls etc. Released back into general pop by lying to medical (vitals) staff whom didn't want to document what I've claimed I was put and when I personally documented each day I lived in quarantine (14 days) w/ elevated blood pressure I'm normally under 100/65. So anything over 100 is high for me.</br></br>

I couldn't take Tylenol as I’m being fitted for a PACE inhaler. Each day I had fever chills, aches, dizziness, no appetite, I had 12 out of 13 and just suffered through it.  Couldn't shower regular. Roommate had medical emergency taken to 805 TTA - told to walk back 3/4 of a mile in the rain.</br></br>

COVID-19 bedding/covers remained infected - both there/upon release back into general population. Once released called a “resolved” case? Resolved means I can work, volunteer in kitchen.</br></br>
 
Released with fever, still spitting up red/brown phlegm. Vitals not taken anymore when 14 day arrives? Placed back into general pop. w/ non-infected (at all) inmates??</br></br>

All inmates placed in 503 as non-infected started catching it almost 2 wks ago (feb 1st-present) so who brought it in.</br></br> 

Fresh fruit still given 1 or 2 a week (2 strawberry, plum, pear, apple). A giant: individual tomato, onion bell pepper, squash, radish, 1 broccoli clove, not at once - every other week?</br></br> 

Institutional kitchens 1 per yard A/B - 1 total kitchen DOESN'T wash trays w/ bleach - using exact same detergent that isn't qualified to clean trays of COVID-19. C/D - 1 total kitchen 2 sanitizing machine 1 for each side.</br></br> 

Presently - CCWF is using the verbiage to appear that it's doing what should be done - while is not even close. No program for normal inmates critical workers list = PIA - of course HFM - overcome COVID-19 brain is real - I forgot how to spell of course!</br></br>

Officers are stealing California tax payers dollars as they are front lining that resolved inmates stay in their cells. 24 hours a day no communication outside the prison. Tablets cant communicate anything if u don't sync the tablet - can't sync in cells! Can't call anybody when lines you from our cells.</br></br> 

Came back from quarantine and now Jan. 27 thru present NOT vitals at all - yet lost sense of smell/taste all over. Got new roommate who just took vaccine? Yet I'm medium risked inmate.</br></br> 

Everything printed sounds great - but it's really an Erin Brockovich situation.</br></br> 
 
Please feel free of printing my name and W# so people can learn what is really behind these walls, happening to the largest Prison in the world. Chowchilla, CA 93610 Women's facility.</br></br> 

Oh yeah four male transgenders w/ penis have arrived - with 46 more en route w/ sexual sensitive criminal cases! Go figure it for all of these already damaged women w/ issues, life sentences etc. because of men/abuse they provided?</br></br> 

Stay tuned - CCWF = Creating Casualties Women's Facility.</br></br>

Its faster and easier to log into my Kiosk. Include a prepaid stamp and it will get there faster than this.</br></br> 

God protect us all.</br></br>

I welcome all questions, concerns, and will respond with the truth - not what CCWF is projecting to the free world about the lack of care we’re actually getting here.</br></br>
