This story was told by a person incarcerated at Solano.</br></br>

Caller: Additionally, the second dilemma, according to a recent report, asymptomatic spreaders account for almost 60 percent of the transmissions. In an incident occurring on January 8, 2021, one person in isolation building nine, cell [redacted], tested positive and transferred to the gym. His cellmate was moved to D yard, 19 building, general population, one hour later. That building is now in isolation.</br></br> 

Currently, the two gyms at CSP Solano are completely packed and there were two known, there were two known incidents where a person who knowingly had COVID was improperly released into the population, causing a cascade of quarantines for those they were housed with.</br></br>

In a separate incident occurring around December 28, 2020 at 6:30 p.m., medical released 46 people from building nine after it was brought to their attention of health director [redacted] that they were past the time of observation. That is, three weeks. Cell [redacted] brought this to their attention and were promptly moved with the 46 people three hours later.</br></br> 

They were moved to building 23 on D yard. The problem is, with mass movements of possible positives in and out of isolation buildings and those who are past the observation periods, it puts them at greater risk for catching COVID and those, but from those who are infected around them unnecessarily. One person, housed in building nine, equated the stay in quarantine buildings like being on death row because when the police come to your door at two or three in the morning, you just disappear.</br></br>

There has also been mass movement of medical releases from these buildings in the middle of the night. Two incidents occurred at 2 p.m. - 2 a.m. under cover of darkness. The transfer of prisoners in large numbers from a higher security to a lower security, according to staff, is new. This is due to reduced staff, a lack of gun coverage during first watch hours.</br></br> 

Previously, when prisoners were moved into buildings, those already housed were alarmed and extremely concerned, such was the case in buildings 21 and 22 on delta yard. There were minor disruptions in these buildings as prisoners were moved from the gym to these buildings. Residents took to the day room to ask questions and requested that medical come and answer them. They did not come.
