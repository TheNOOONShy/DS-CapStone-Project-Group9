Dear PrisonPandemic,</br></br>

I hope you are well. I am really surprised that someone, or an organization, cares about prisoners. Thank you. I am grateful for the opportunity to share my experience. But before I tell you my story, I will tell you a little about myself.</br></br>

I have been incarcerated since March 1998. I have two years left. I have been a fuck up, but I changed my life in here, not because of anything the CDCR did, but because people like you helped my feel like a human again.</br></br>

I work with two non-profits. I have published art and I co-authored a book about prisons in California. I am always happy to share how society sees us convicts.</br></br>

It's really sad how such a rich state can use so much money and resources to keep over 100,000 men and women, and still say that it's the right thing to do.</br></br>

On March 2020 or around there, we stopped getting visits. I was at Calipatria and was moved to Mule Creek because I got really sick. At Mule Creek, I came to this world where it seems like all reason goes out the door.</br></br>

This place is strange. Once visits stopped, people started acting better because there were no more drugs coming in. The only drugs coming in was from the staff, and that's very little, so not many people had access to them.</br></br>

A lot of people got clean and some took to drinking a lot more. I thought that the prison was going to set up a way for us to stay in contact with our families but that was the last thing on their minds.</br></br>

They posted on the prison webpage that we were given masks but none were given out. They said that we were staying six feet away, but none of that was enforced. We were all using the same six phones.</br></br>

There was no plan for anything. None of the COs would wear their masks. There were a lot of arguments between the inmates and COs. Because the COs would tell the inmates to put their masks on when they wouldn't do it themselves.</br></br>

The COs were supposed to wear full PPE but they saw it as a joke. The funniest thing is when there is an audit and there were a few. All the COs tell the inmates when it's happening and to comply while the audit is going on.</br></br>

That happens at every prison. It is not possible to have a surprise audit in a prison. As soon as the auditors leave, it goes back to normal.</br></br>

I personally have a girlfriend in South Carolina that I have been with for almost 11 years and it's hard to see each other. And with this going on we haven't seen each other in person for over a year.</br></br>

I will tell you a sad fact. Most inmates don't have anyone who gives a shit about them. I am lucky, but I see it everywhere.</br></br>

A lot of people don't even care. What this pandemic did was isolate people even worse. They are trying to start a tablet program in California prisons, and it's about time.</br></br>

This pandemic has shown how easily things can go bad. In Mule Creek, in my yard, only one person died. He worked with me, and the sad thing is that I never even spoke to him.</br></br>

I do want to give credit to some of the family members, they had a protest in front of the prison, but nothing happened. The COs went out and intimidated the women. At least they tried.</br></br>

You want to know the truth about this pandemic and prisons. We are last on the list for anything, and they try to hide everything. I got COVID in February of 2021 and they took us to the gym.</br></br>

We were housed with a bunch of other men who were sick. But they never bothered to take a second test, because there were a lot of false positives. The prison hired a medical company to come and deal with the COVID-related medical.</br></br>

They took our temperatures and blood pressure and asked if anything was wrong. I told them numerous times that I felt bad, and still do have problems with breathing, but they only wrote it down and did nothing.</br></br>

CDCR hired them solely for the purpose of liability. The medical company did absolutely nothing for anyone. Once we spent 14 days in the gym, we were brought back to the cell and put in there with people who weren't sick. Then they got sick.</br></br>

Mule Creek State Prison made an effort to get everyone sick so they could resume the program. All they care about was not having to work. If you have ever worked, or observed a day in prison, COs do not like to work!</br></br>

The one thing that they refused to shut down was the forced labor that they say is a program under the name of PIA. PIA supplies most of the supplies to CDCR and other state agencies. They found a way to keep making money out of the state after they retire.</br></br>

The salaries these people pull is disgusting and the workers get 30 cents to 1 dollar and they break their backs working. They did not shut that down.</br></br>

Honestly, prisoners are what Dostoyevsky said, "Made out of the toughest wood in the forest". We can handle a lot of chaos. Most of us come from fucked up situations. Buddha said that given a certain environment, men will do things that are criminal.</br></br>

That isn't an excuse but society looks at people as individuals when actually we are part of a whole. And the society we live in has an obligation to its people. The European way of thinking helps its people, and the United States model makes more criminals.</br></br>

I can speak for myself. I came in a naive kid. Now I can honestly say my mind is more criminally orientated. The only thing that helps me, is that I care.</br></br> 

I have people who give a shit what happens to me. CDCR did zero to help me, and it doesn't help anyone but the people who draw a check from it.</br></br>

I can't say what the pandemic did specifically to us, but what I can tell you is that I saw on TV how the pandemic brought out the best in people out there. But in here, in here it did the opposite. It brought out the worst in the people who are in charge of us.</br></br>

I am not a victim, a victim is a choice. I choose to not allow my environment to dictate who I am. I killed someone in 1998 and I deserve everything that happens to me.</br></br> 

That is my karma, and I accept it, however it makes me sad to see that the people who are supposed to help criminals change their lives are actually worse that the criminals.</br></br>

Nietzsche said "Be careful when fighting monsters, you might become one yourself," and that's what happens a lot of the time. COs assimilate to us. They talk, walk, and act like us.</br></br>

California prisons are a special case because gangs control them, and they end up deciding how we react to the pandemic. If an old man says be violent, we are violent. If the old man says stay down, we stay down.</br></br>

The mafia dictates our behavior. Then you have SNY yards, they don't know what to do. Most criminals are followers and they want to be told how to feel, when they don't have that they are on robot mode.</br></br>

They don't feel. The saddest thing is this about the pandemic and criminals in general. We have very little education. A lot of us are okay being dumb.</br></br>

We watch Jerry Springer and laugh. We eat, we drink, we do drugs, and we are happy. I am sorry to say this but 80 percent of people here fall into that category, and that can be fixed. But society prefers us like that, that way they have someone to point their fingers at.</br></br>

The politicians, the priest, the crooked person. They need the criminal to exist and this pandemic didn't change anything. They gave us the vaccine before the public. That was the worst thing they could have done.</br></br>

Now we can resume the drug use, and the PIA sweatshops can resume. The COs can go back to doing nothing. We can go back to the illusion of rehabilitation. How I wish this place would help the people in it.</br></br>

Thank you for allowing me to express my experience with you. I don't know if I was of any help. If there are other projects that I would be helpful with, I would gladly do so.</br></br>

I am a great activist, and a decent writer. I am trying to publish two books. I don't know if I'll be able to do it from here but life's not over. Hope keeps a person tolerating this thing called life.</br></br>

Sincerely.</br></br>

PS. How many criminals does it take to screw on a lightbulb? None, they'll steal it from you.
