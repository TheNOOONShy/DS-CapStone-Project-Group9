This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Donovan.</br></br>

I received your letter and was very surprised, some people really do have interest on what goes on around here. It's heartwarming to feel someone cares, even if it is a project, movement, etc. I can’t express through paper how much I appreciate that letter. It couldn’t have come at a better time. Thank you.</br></br>

To answer your question, things around here are bad. Yes, of course it can be worst, however it can be better as well. It almost feels as if this pandemic is being utilized to minimize our program. I had more program in a 180-yard than I do now. For those who don’t know/understand what I mean by that, it’s bad.</br></br>

I miss my family. Yes we do get to make phone calls but due to this pandemic, the phone sign-ups are dictated by the corrections officer, so being able to get a time of choice is not always an option. I ask myself and discuss with others “are we being punished?” All because one inmate tested positive for COVID-19, the whole facility gets locked down?</br></br>

I am no-one to speak up on this, I get in trouble if I do, so I just follow the rules. This is why I appreciate your letter so much, because I see it as an outlet to express my/our reality to someone who actually took an interest in asking the question “what’s going on in there”?</br></br>

You should see our food trays. A kids meal at McDonalds is much more than we are fed. I don’t mean a big kids meal either. If a person in here does not have someone helping/looking out for him or hustle, we go hungry.</br></br>

We can’t even get proper or, in cases, any medical attention, and this is a “medical-facility”? I’ve had no exaggeration about 20 medical appointments in the past two months and got seen only one time. They say if it's not important, don’t bother. Due to the pandemic, they/medical is only receiving “emergencies.” So that’s another reality I live.</br></br>

If my stomach or head or arm is hurting and I ask for help, I am either given a tylenol/ibuprofen or told to drink a lot of water and sent back to my cell. Oh well, I am led to believe that I don’t deserve proper care of any sort due to the fact that I am in prison. I try everyday to see the bright side in things no matter how dark they are. I have hope and my family is my motivation, support system. I will make it home to my loved ones.</br></br>

Thank you for taking the time to write me so I return the gesture to you. I have not lost my manners or morals. If someone offers a helping hand you take it or show appreciation.
