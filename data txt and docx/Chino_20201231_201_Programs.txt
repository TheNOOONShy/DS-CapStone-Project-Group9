I've actually been on this transformational path for a couple years just trying to better as a person period so I am able to succeed once I am free.</br></br>

While I was at Pelican Bay I attended college, self help programs, as well as entrepreneurial programs where they teach entrepreneurship along with life skills. You see I applied these tools I learned and just kept working and telling myself that my cause is greater.</br></br>

Once I got the hang of it, I persevered. Even though I struggled at first I focused on the positive and this worked for me.
