Caller: The fear was palpable for a lot of guys. You know, in prison you kind of have to buck up a little bit. You know, you're always there, somebody is- that's the one thing about Quentin and these programming prisons,there's somebody always ready to listen.</br></br>

So you can talk, you can say- you can, and there's enough inner strength to say “I am afraid.” But it was there. And a lot of guys, were- very few people were voicing all the, “it's nothing, don't worry about it.”</br></br>

People weren't saying that. Saying, “I understand. I understand.” And the medical staff was good. You know, they had their hands tied, it must have been incredibly frustrating for them.</br></br>

Because there was only so much that they were allowed to do within this context. Prayer, meditation, talking to friends, voicing it, writing letters. I mean, I wrote some really weird letters.</br></br>

People were like- when I got out to and talked to em they said, man, we got those letters, and  said oh my god, this isn't [redacted], you know, but I guess I, there's a, there's a real emotional component to COVID. And in that kind of a situation, you kind of say- in that situation, it's like, it's the anxiety is even worse. So you have to just ride it out sometimes.</br></br>

It was hard. It was really hard. And it was intense.</br></br>

And I think that discovering that now too with a lot of people on the streets that have had COVID is that there is anxiety, there is a dimension to it that is not just physical. That you know, and I'm still feeling fatigued at times. I'm still feeling my smell isn't back.</br></br>

And taste is okay. Pretty good, I think. Some things taste great, you know, so I guess I guess it's there.</br></br>

But, you know, weakness, imbalance. Sometimes I'll just all of a sudden feel like I have no- my equilibrium just shifts, and then it comes back. So I don't know if that's that or I'm just getting old or whatever, but I have to think that it's from that too.</br></br>

And so it's- it's- it's got some long-term effects to it.
