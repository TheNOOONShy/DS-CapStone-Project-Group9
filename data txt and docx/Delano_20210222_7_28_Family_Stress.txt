This story was told by a person incarcerated at Delano.</br></br>UCI:  And if it’s okay to ask you, a personal question, so how has it-</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, sure.</br></br>

UCI: How has it been like for you to have reduced visitation and programming or visits from your loved ones?</br></br>

Caller: Well you know what I mean, that’s probably, it’s made the irritability and the tension in this place go up like 10 times. You know, people are irritated. You know, I haven’t seen, I haven’t been able to sit there and see my son, have a visit with him or nothing in, you know, 10 months. You know, they were only doing phone calls one day a week, except they put us in these dorms so we can work and it’s supposed to be voluntary.</br></br> 

But they’re saying we couldn’t have phones in there so we all said “Hey we’re not gonna work” and so they gave us more phones only in the last two weeks.</br></br> 

UCI: Mmhmm.</br></br>

Caller: But you know it’s hard you know what I’m saying? I mean it’s bad enough as it is, you know, but not being able to go to library to get books, not being able to have visits. And then just sitting here and being treated like shit. It’s not a good feeling, you know?</br></br>

UCI: Mmhmm.
