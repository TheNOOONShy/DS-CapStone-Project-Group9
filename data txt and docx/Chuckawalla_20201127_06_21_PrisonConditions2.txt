Caller: But I've had friends who got hit hard. Their lungs, they had a hard time breathing. They put him on oxygen at saturation five and sent them to the hospitals around the area. From what I understand, the hospitals were great. These guys were really, they worked hard to help these inmates.</br></br>Actually, you know, made them feel more like human beings than inmates then, you know, like staff here does. So, they ended up moving us. So, we ended up getting it, they put us in, what they have is isolation building. It's on our yard. Another thing too, yeah, it's on our yard.
