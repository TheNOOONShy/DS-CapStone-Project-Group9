I will be calling soon. For now I composed this piece with COVID in mind. Feel free to request poetry, art, greeting cards.</br></br>


FORTITUDE</br></br>


From the point of labor
As neonates we rush to’rds the exit
Unaware that life might not be pleasant
But up until that point
We are from desperate</br></br>


We’re quick to think as cynics
“No matter what we’ll manage”
Up to the time we realize
The solution we had visualized is dry paint on the canvas
Suddenly becoming frantic --- off natural instinct we all panic
Then we debunk the belief… 
… The love we shared had vanished</br></br>


We are firm believers being… 
… Belief’s what keeps us going
We’re not too fond of secrets
We have this thing of always knowing</br></br>


We’re compelled to give a helping hand
To offer comfort when it’s needed
To encourage one another
When our lungs have been depleted and spirit feels defeated</br></br>


While some turn to medicine
Others count on miracles waiting to be saved 
Regardless of our choices
Of the fact that we think different
There’s nothing more empowering than knowing we are brave.</br></br>


For those of you whom have lost loved ones as a result of this pandemic, I express my deepest sincerity and urge you to stay strong, stay positive, stay grounded. You are LOVED.</br></br>
