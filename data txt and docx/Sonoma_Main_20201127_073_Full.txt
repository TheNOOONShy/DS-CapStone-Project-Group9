This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Sonoma County Main Adult Detention Facility.</br></br>

First off, let me start by saying thank you for taking the time out of your day to review my letter. I’m writing you this letter because I was informed by a fellow inmate that you could help us. The Main Adult Detention Facility of Sonoma County has not been following the proper procedures that have been implemented by the public health and safety to prevent COVID-19 from entering and spreading through the facility.</br></br>

Therefore, may cause us inmates that have been incarcerated for months or even years to be infected by this viral and contagious disease. Many sentenced and un-sentenced inmates housed in this module, such as I, have been put to work in the kitchen voluntarily or involuntarily.</br></br>

From paying attention to the news on a daily basis, I know that we are to wear our masks at all times except for when eating or drinking. We are to wash our hands or sanitize them after use of the restrooms, practice six feet social distancing and etc. And yet, these aren’t practiced well enough. Nine to 15 of us kitchen workers have to eat in a 10 by 15 feet break room.</br></br>

When serving the units food, we serve them on rubber trays that are returned to us to clean after use. These trays and carts that we send them on aren’t labeled by quarantine mods or not. We have been told by few staff members that there is a quarantine mod where people go through the 14-day COVID screening, but some of the staff has told us there isn’t one or they have no knowledge of it.</br></br>

We are being told false information to dissuade us from the truth. If there is a quarantine mod, as there should be, then people who could possibly have COVID-19 are eating off the trays that are being returned to us un-sanitized or not bleached.</br></br>

A contagious virus such as COVID-19 needs H2O to duplicate its gene, which in turn, creates enormous amounts of virus that infects people. COVID-19 is not only a liquid contagious disease but also can go airborne.</br></br>

So if someone were to spit, pee, defecate, sneeze, bleed on a tray or eat off the spoons–– which we send to certain mods, only to receive when done–– has COVID-19, then we are unfortunately vulnerable to inhaling the pathogens into our body systems.</br></br> 

They tell us everyday that they are following the correct procedures but it doesn’t seem so.</br></br>

Our mods are packed to near full with people. People are celled up with others without the knowledge if the person is COVID-19 negative. Even us kitchen workers could have caught COVID-19 from the kitchen, only to bring it back to the housing unit and possibly spreading it. Due to the fact that we aren’t tested on a daily basis, weekly basis or even a bi-weekly basis.</br></br>

There is no six feet social distancing markers nor is it being properly practiced. The kitchen crew doesn’t get to shower upon re-entrance into the unit, as we should be. Medical and dental compliance is a slim chance. I admitted a form on November 02, 2020 only to just barely be seen about my dental problem on November 19, 2020.</br></br>

On numerous occasions, I’ve submitted medical forms for the same problem because I was not being seen. We aren’t even certified to handle the food that's being passed to the module units. We don’t wear protective gear to prevent the capture of COVID-19.</br></br>

I personally call the kitchen “water world” due to the fact that it’s completely covered by water 90 percent of the time, making it an incubator for a virus. We return to the housing units and assigned cells covered in grime, water, and sweat. When our bodies heat up, our pores open, which in turn, let’s bacteria or viruses, like COVID-19, to possibly enter our body.</br></br>

Upon entering the facility to be booked and housed, people are given N-92 medical masks. Only for it to be taken away and given a different mask that’s a very thin cloth. Once you’re in the kitchen, you’re supposed to be given a thicker cloth mask. I’ve asked for that certain mask only to be told that they don’t have any.</br></br>

On November 11, 2020, I received that specific mask because the prior one always slid down my face, exposing me or anybody to the possibility of catching COVID-19. We deal with boiling hot water that we are harmed by if we aren’t careful. I’ve personally been burned by chemicals and the hot water.</br></br> 

My skin peeled by excessive exposure to these chemicals which prine and blister my hands.</br></br>

We encounter the staff members in the kitchen on a daily basis. Sometimes they aren’t wearing their masks properly or aren’t wearing gloves. Us kitchen workers have no knowledge of who is COVID-19 negative. One officer caught COVID-19 and had to go on a 14 day quarantine.</br></br> 

What if he brought it in?</br></br>

They don’t tell us anything because they think that us inmates aren’t a “need to know basis”. I do not want to be the one to catch or even give COVID-19. So I ask of you to help us. We still want to see and hear our families voices.</br></br> 

I hope this letter reaches you in good health and high spirits. Stay safe and stay blessed. Thank you.
