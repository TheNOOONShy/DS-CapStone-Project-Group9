Hello,</br></br>

My name is [redacted], age 39, from LA, CA currently serving 6 years.</br></br>

I got your letter asking for our stories about COVID while being locked up.</br></br>

It’s been hard. On the 12th of December I woke up with the shakes and a bad chest cold. I was pretty sure it was COVID since every one around me was getting it and being moved to God knew where.</br></br>

Sure enough it was and I was told to pack up and move to isolation. In insolation the nurses came around twice a day to check our vitals. Which was nice of the state to do.</br></br>

After 9 days I was having bad anxiety and my blood pressure was 240/128 when the nurses came to check on me. I was eventually taken out to the local hospital “Banner”. What was causing it was that a pain med I was taking prior to covid had dropped my subivm down to lethal levels. I find it strange that I was on that med for 2 years with no trouble then I get COVID and bam I’m about to die from my meds.</br></br>

Eventually I was cleared from isolation and moved, all in total since COVID I’ve had seven cell moves. It’s hard on us to move that much. Plus sometimes it seems as if they were moving us around in order to pass it around. IDK.</br></br> 

The hardest part of it has been that I was scheduled to have a colonoscopy for some internal problems that I was having, however, since COVID I’m on the back burner. They say only emergencies. As of today I put a medical slip in twice this week trying to go through the proper channels to see a Dr.</br></br> 

Because my problem is causing me great discomfort and is bleeding inside. The nurse was unable to see the problem and just pushed me off again. It’s so frustrating. I have the other option of going “man down” but that has all kinds of problems that go with it. I just pray that I see a Dr. tomorrow. Maybe someone calling up here on my behalf would help, IDK.</br></br> 

The program has been on lockdown of modified the whole pandemic, so that is hard on us too. We’re all locked in cells and sick and it gets to you. If there is a God I pray he helps us all out of this nightmare. I called my mom today and she just tested positive yesterday for COVID, so, I know that the virus is not just effecting us, it’s got a far reaching hand. I’m sure it’s hard for ppl outside too.</br></br>

The biggest thing is not having control over your own treatment. When you're sick you want help. Here your help is slow to come and it’s damn sure not on your time. Well that’s just a lil of what I’ve been going thru. If you have a God please pray to him for me.</br></br> 

God help us,</br></br>
