Greetings PrisonPandemic student!</br></br>

I received your letter and I really appreciate you giving me the opportunity to tell you my story. Well as you already I know, I’m currently incarcerated and let me just say this, it is not good. I was supposed to transfer to another prison due to a change in my level of car. I’m a patient inmate in the Mental Health Department System.</br></br> 

I’m supposed to go to a hospital setting prison because this prison: CCI, isn’t equipped to assist me being this isn’t a hospital/prison.</br></br>

So I was to be moved asap but due to COVID-19 all transfers are to be stopped completely! Now I’m stuck here and I’m not getting the proper care I’m needing of. I am trying my best to cope under these unfortunate times but it has been very challenging!</br></br>

I’m facing new challenges now, I’m currently house in ad seg or “the hole” due to a incident involving behavior that could lead to violence.</br></br>

It’s insane! Because, I was not supposed to be here in the first place for that incident to have even happened. This kind of treatment is nothing new to me. When I was in juvenile hall, I faced the courts time after time from age 12 to 18 years old, and it feels the same to me.</br></br>

The justice system our country uses today is not very useful or helpful at all. The people are worse than they were once released, and that only puts outside communities at risk. There has to be another way of rehabilitating inmates than just locking us away and throwing the key!</br></br> 

What if the judge, DA, and other officials could do something else for victim than just putting suspect behind bars to be released with anger, and even more motive to do harm to community?</br></br>

I wish that were true, I feel like the juvenile justice system failed me through by placing me in group homes, juvenile hall. Only making me worse and more of menace to society. I think that’s why I’m where I’m at today. 27 years behind prison walls facing 12 years sentence, maybe.</br></br> 

Anyways I’m approaching the bottom of this letter so I’m going to end it here with all my respect. Take care out there.</br></br>

Sincerely.
