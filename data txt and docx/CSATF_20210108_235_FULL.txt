Dear Reader,</br></br>

I hope this response finds you all in good health as well. As for myself, I’d be wrong if I said I wasn’t alright. The good Lord blessed me with another day. That’s basically how I live my life in here.</br></br> 

One day at a time. That is if I’m allowed one again.</br></br>

Since COVID-19, what little program we had no longer exists. And we just recently got put on a two week lockdown to stop the spread of the coronavirus from another yard. Before COVID-19 I facilitated Alcoholics Anonymous, and Criminal Gang Members Anonymous.</br></br> 

I voluntarily did this work in every prison I’ve been to.</br></br>

Although participation in self help groups among inmates who are a part of disruptive groups is low, I never let it discourage me. Being that I denounced my gang affiliation when I first arrived in the prison system. Dealing with those who are has been challenging, but I never let it stop me.</br></br>

I believe my life has purpose, and enjoy helping others in this capacity. However prison is not the place for someone like me to try and make a difference. The longer I’m here the greater my chances of losing my life, or extending my stay.</br></br> 

The prison is really set up for me to fail because I have a good head on my shoulders.</br></br>

I just turned 50, and have more years behind me than I have ahead of me. If I make it out of here all I plan to do is something good with the rest of my life, and take care of my mom. She’s a disabled veteran from the army, and I’m her only child.</br></br>

Since COVID-19 I really have reservations about seeing her again. I haven’t tested positive but I’m at greater risk of complications because of my age, and that scares me. There is so much more I want to say, but doubt if my getting out concerns you, and your team.</br></br> 

You’re collecting stories for a historical archive, and I’m trying to get out of prison.</br></br> 

I need someone to advocate for my freedom. I appreciate what you all are trying to do. But if I wanted to, I can’t tell you what I really want to for fear of retaliation.</br></br>

But know this. I’m not your average criminal, and I learned a lot from my uncle. I also met a lot of people who are successful businessmen and celebrities. Being here is very depressing for me because I’m so much better than this.</br></br> 

My past got me convicted, and no matter how much good I do here it will never change the way they see.</br></br>

As of right now, we’re on lockdown for a racial riot between Blacks and Southern Mexicans. It’s situations like this that can cause me harm. If I’m on the yard and something happens I’m obligated to participate. If not the Blacks will be trying to get me.</br></br> 

And even if I was just defending myself, I’ll still be written up, and given more time. So you see my dilemma. This is what they call stuck between a rock, and a hard place. LOL.</br></br>

I’m going to end this letter on that note, but I’m sending a couple documents so you can see who you’re dealing with. Maybe you can find someone who’s willing to help me. I’ve been in prison over 15 years and have yet to hear of any change in law that can help me.</br></br> 

There’s always some criterion or something in the language deterring me from relief.</br></br> 

So I kinda lost interest.</br></br>

I have about five years left which is basically enhancement time. I was sentenced to nine years for alleged carjacking. The judge even said my case wasn’t like the carjackings he normally tried. He specifically called it weird.</br></br> 

I literally drove someone home in a car somebody else took.</br></br> 

I knew I was wrong but I didn’t think it would all come back on me. The crime had nothing to do with gangs but the DA sure was allowed to bring up my past affiliation. I had been a free man almost a decade until this happened.</br></br>

Anyway nine years plus nine more for a 1989 prior, and five more for a 1992 prior, or possession of a firearm. That’s really all my record consists of felony-wise. I have three traffic related offenses but that was it. But at the end of the day I’m doing enhancement time, and well exceeded the base term of my sentence. 23 years.</br></br>

I heard the new District Attorney for LA abolished enhancement in some Directive 20-08, and 20-14. But like I said earlier I’m sure there is gonna be something stopping me from relief. But I also said I need someone to advocate for my freedom. Thanks for listening. Please send documents back.</br></br>

You can also contact me via Jpay email if you have any questions that you’d like answered promptly.</br></br>

Sincerely.
