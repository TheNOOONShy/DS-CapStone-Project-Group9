This story was told by a person incarcerated at Tulare South County Detention Center.</br></br>UCI: How has the COVID situation been like there?</br></br>Caller: For the most part, they come in and test and all that, you know, I mean but as far as I'm concerned, the cleaning, keeping the Ñ you know what I mean? Because you got, because there is a lot of people come through, you know what I mean? So like, I think you should have a choice to have a bunkie that had a shot or don't have a shot. You know what I mean?</br></br>And they don't let you decide on that. So, you never know. I've had the shot. Then now I've been trying to get the booster shot, and they were trying to get my record on it and whatever, but I think the cleaning of the phones, and they should have a spray bottle all the time right here by the phones to clean the phones because you never know.</br></br>I mean, yeah. But, you know, I mean there's not a lot of us here. There's - I mean, just in this unit, there is 60. So, that is 60 people that are using these phones, and there's only two phones that, you know what I mean, they should have a spray to clean them, you know, to kill the bacteria or whatever, COVID. You know?</br></br>They make us wear face shields and a face mask all the time. You know? And then, you know, sometimes we need new ones because they get bent up, or they get dirty, or they get broke. And sometimes it's a pain in the butt to get one.</br></br>

But you know, then they give these masks to us that are rewashed. I mean, I don't know if they are supposed to rewash them. You know? If they do, then, you know, I mean Ñ some of them are stretched out.</br></br> 

You know, to me, they just don't put enough effort into making sure that we don't catch it in here. You know?
