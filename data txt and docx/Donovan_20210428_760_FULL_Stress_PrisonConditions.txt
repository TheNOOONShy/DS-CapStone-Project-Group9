Hello PrisonPandemic,</br></br>


I appreciate you sending those positive vibes. I send mine right back! It’s good to know we are not forgotten about. To tell the truth 2020 and 2021 has definitely been something. Me personally I have immune to the worst.</br></br> 


But I am highly aware things could always get worse. But hard times truly give me strength. I try to visualize thing from a higher perspective and try to be the greater version of myself each, and every day.</br></br> 


CDC has not helped me on pretty much everything I’ve learned this pandemic. They could care less about us as individuals mental and spiritual health is at 100% risk for someone who does not know their creators. Reduced visitation has gotten normal, it is tough feeling down played as if we are not equal to being a human.</br></br> 


But at the end I will stand tall. Although my release date in the computer isn't near. It is a mental warfare. I’ve turned this negative to a positive and look at life through a different perspective.</br></br> 


So I’m sorry if this letter did not help. And also for my grammar. But this is my truth.</br></br>


Sincerely.
