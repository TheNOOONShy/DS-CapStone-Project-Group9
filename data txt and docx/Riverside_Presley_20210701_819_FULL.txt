This story was told by a person incarcerated at Robert Presley Detention Center.</br></br> 

UCI: So, what facility are you currently housed at?</br></br> 

Caller: I'm at Robert Presley in Riverside.</br></br>

UCI: Riverside. And how has COVID been like for you at your facility?</br></br>

Caller: As far as me, it hasn't affected me at all except for the way they run things right here. I guess it was different. Instead of everybody coming out at once, it's mostly down to quarter tiers. I'm in a pod day room where there's 20 cells. So, they're only releasing five of them every hour.</br></br>

So, a majority of the time, we'll get twice a day to come out for about 45 to an hour, and that's because of the COVID I hear. Before, it was everybody out at once, you know, and lock it down every hour and then come back out. So, that's how COVID has affected that as far as day room anyways. But do you have a question and, like, something specific?</br></br>

UCI: No, the floor is all yours. You can - You are free to describe how COVID affected you, how you saw it affect others, if it changed for the worse, if it changed your situation for the worse.</br></br>

Caller: Oh, shit. I don't know. I don't really know what to say. You know, I was just calling because I got this letter a while back, and I was just curious about - Mary is the one that wrote it. Kristin Turney I guess is the professor. I'm not sure if I got your name or not, but you said no names. So, okay I got all that.</br></br>

UCI: Oh, well, my name is Talisa. Your name is going to be blurred if we post a story on the website. But if you do have questions, I can answer it about our project.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah. I was curious what this is all - like, the project, yeah, like you said, like, what is this? Because all I see in the bottom is, you know, kind of a little description, but there really isn't much of that, much more than that.</br></br>

UCI: Oh, okay. So, our goal project is to witness what people are experiencing inside our prisons during the pandemic, and it's an opportunity for your voices to be heard since we do post it anonymously on our website, so people can hear what it's like.</br></br>

Caller: So, just to see what it's like being in jail while the COVID-19 is out?</br></br>

UCI: Yes, for voices to be heard and for people to listen.</br></br>

Caller:  Who is listening, though? Is, like, is this all going towards changes being made, or is it just for, like, curiosity kind of a thing?</br></br>

UCI: We hope it does change for the future. It's to archive the experience and to provide a greater transparency to the crisis. It's a digital archive.</br></br>

Caller: Where is all this information going, though? Like, who is it going to? Other universities or just, like, publications or newspapers or, you know, social media? Like, that's what I'm, like, wanting to know.</br></br>

UCI: We do have a social media branch in the project, and we post the stories on our website for our university, and it's open to the public. Of course, your name is anonymous, so your name won't be specified.</br></br>

Caller: What about political? Is it going to, like, lawmakers, you know, people like that?</br></br>

UCI: Lawmakers, if they go on our website, they can hear the story.</br></br>

Caller: So, who is putting it all together? Is it, like, professors or?</br></br>

UCI: Yes. We are a team at UCI, and we have our supervisors and people in charge.</br></br>

Caller: Okay. So, is this a big project, like, or is it just, like, limited to, like, a classroom or part of the - I'm just curious, you know?</br></br>

UCI: No, it's a good project. It's a big one. It's not limited to anybody, and we're all volunteers to help your voices be heard.</br></br>

Caller: Okay. So, other than getting a little information from in here, what else are you trying to get? Like, is that all you're looking for, is the COVID-19 information?</br></br>

UCI: Yes, we are specific to COVID-19.</br></br>

Caller: All right, because it says to mail your letters, artwork, or other contributions. Like, I don't even know what that means, your other contributions. What does that mean?</br></br>

UCI: Oh, well, it is true. You can send mail. You can send letters. You can send artwork to our P.O. box, and other contributions can be anything. If you want to write about your story, if you want to - our P.O. box is open.</br></br>

Caller: Like, just COVID story or just, like, anything?</br></br>

UCI: It is COVID, yeah, regards to the pandemic.</br></br>

Caller: Okay, well, I wouldn't be able to help you very much in regards to the pandemic. You know, all I know about it, is the effects from it, the same thing as out there. People wear a mask. People get beat up for not wearing the mask. It all depends on how everything wants to go, but it's calming down. But as far as, like, affects me personally, I can't answer really too much about that. That's about it.</br></br>

UCI: That's okay, actually. Thank you very much for calling and asking about our project. I do appreciate it.</br></br>

Caller: All right. Yeah, well, I've had this, so I was curious. But thank you, though, and you have a good night.</br></br>

UCI: Of course. Thank you so much. You, too.</br></br>

Caller: All right, bye.</br></br>

UCI: Bye.</br></br>
