Dear PrisonPandemic,</br></br>

Having COVID in prison to me is like having AIDS, Ebola and being bullied. Everything is hopeless, lockdowns, it’s like being in the “shu” solitary confinement, it’s like being with a disease being screamed at, constantly yelled and sodomized, raped, plunder, and reprisal against because of COVID. You get bullied for COVID.</br></br>

Having no visits breaks me, having no visits makes me not believe in God anymore! It makes me feel like the government, prisonscrats are God or the devil enforcers. I’ve had 10 deaths and aware of 15 deaths of family and friends from COVID, other complications! And I don’t watch nothing related to God or the word anymore cause it’s like the state, government are hypocrites, we can’t complain, don’t have luxury of protest or grievance without reprisals! Nobody cares about my life!</br></br>

I had complications, my leg ballooned up at night when I had COVID, it swoll up 10 times its size. I had thumping temple head throbs, rolling chills, no taste, no smell sense for 60 days. No meds but water! Everybody irritable, nobody cares it’s a job everybody hates but will take out their hostility on a grown ass prisoner cause your problems become mines with direct orders.</br></br>

They government or prisoncrats didn’t go to a Trump rally forcing masks, or COVID restrictions or to sturgis motorcycle rally. But a prisoner gets disrespected even when I’m humble, respectful and non-disruptive. Cause of COVID it’d be a guard that pissed over his own crap but will go bananas on you for not standing in front of building when it’s yard recall. I’m walking to the building. WTF, why are you bothering? I just got off work, I work through pandemic and I ain’t being violent, disruptive, or disrespectful. I got pulled over cause I didn’t stand in front of building which some good ole boy prisoners do! I’ve not seen a memo from captain or warden stating all prisoners who work shall stand in front of building coming from work due to COVID!</br></br>

Some prison guards balk social distance so which one is it? You can stand in front if officers don’t let you in why do I’ve to stand in front of building? Pre-COVID, it wasn’t all the unnecessary nonsense like we don’t have stress. We got problems too! If we’re having a bad year we better not allow it to surface. We gotta be obedient our entire time incarcerated with COVID, with deaths, with no visits, just mean ass guards that turn prison into hell on earth for what? Cause of COVID? We didn’t smuggle in COVID? We didn’t email the pandemic or start riot-COVID. We didn’t COVID assault anyone but I got infected and grateful I didn’t die but I felt like I would. I’ve thyroid ailments and high blood pressure.</br></br>

Before the pandemic it was still “law and order” but with programs to avail oneself even though some disgruntled staff would eke out and taunt, “you wasn’t going to groups, therapy, college and work when you were free and in society.” I’d say like a lamb with respect “I’m trying to take advantage of the opportunity now.” The disgruntled staff replied “If I was in your shoes I’d be doing the same thing.”</br></br>

But in the pandemic everybody is like gestapos, no “how you doing c/o?” they give you a “fudge-off, fudge-you” or “you better stop looking at me,” especially if they are a woman. They aggressively shake their canister of pepper spray saying “you better look away yeah you’d.” You get no visits, can’t see your family, you got no rights let alone human rights. Just constant bullying you and sodomizing you out of phone calls for no reason. CDCR can’t chew bubblegum and talk no more. Everything that was normal morphed into “Make Prison Great Again,” where no rights. Just subtle debauchery of “just desserts,” no protections. Just the mark of the beast, no lip or no protest. If you file a grievance you get reprisal, blackballed and label a target for no video visits or withhold of your COVID Quarterly Package.</br></br>

The pandemic broke my spirit in belief in God. I believe in law and order, propaganda and no family visits. The pandemic brought out King Alfred Plan with a solitary confinement control. The pandemic is like being punished for being disruptive, violent and disrespectful towards staff and placed in the shu.</br></br>

P.S. I’ve been coping by eating junk food, exercise, talking crap to prisoners and my wife! I’ve been coping by working six days from 6:30-3:30 in Prison Industries Authority and college participation! It’s sad! It’s destroying every body parental and marriage connections!</br></br>

They treat you like you are the cause of the COVID spread or the pandemic is your fault it’s spreading. Anytime it’s a protest, pandemic, police killing or shooting of a Black or Brown shooting we get shouted at or bullied. It’s bringing the worst in everybody. It’s breeding hopelessness, and it’s breeding silence.</br></br>

The pandemic within prison is like being a pogrom. Every step you walk through the pandemic is more repressiveness! No phone calls during work but you’re a essential worker but treated like a sweatshop worker in the United States of Amerikkka with repressive gestapo with rank who don’t want to get in touch with our family. Less and less phone calls, we get 2-3 calls per week if we are lucky! I’ve been trying to get a video visit since Dec. 2020! It’s been a hopelessness. The lower level prisons are bullies and screwing us over here like it’s our fault we caught COVID or we smuggled it in. We got COVID on quarantine and the nurses talk to you crazy like it’s a sin cause you want your vitals. But it’s their job!</br></br>

The entire system is a failure. They use COVID as a reason to sodomize you out of family ties, they rape you of fresh air. COs - they bully you like you a Black Lives Matter protestor! The system makes you hate religion, they deny religion services. They break you down where you feel helpless and like this pandemic is God, the government, CDCR, wardens, medical are the 666 Devils creating more more hell on shithole facilities like this! Due to no protection of our privileges like visits and calls.
