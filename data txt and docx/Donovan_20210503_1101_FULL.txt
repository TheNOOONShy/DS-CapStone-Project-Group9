This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Donovan. </br></br>First, foremost upon receiving my message may the powerful arms of God forever embrace you both. All the college students there stay safe, strong. This is a great opportunity to converse with young people in the thinking world, meaning school. For I was always taught knowledge is king. </br></br> Now allow me to allow you both to know that you have people under these circumstances that have lost strength, confidence in self, faith, even hope. But a man embraces the reality of his wrong choices in life and strive to never give up yet make better decisions. With that said you wrote to an inmate that has lost hope. </br></br> Therefore, it's allowed me the opportunity to share my mind with some intelligent college brains. </br></br> Yes, everyone has a story. But what I was attracted by in your introduction was how you spoke of knowing we are thought of and to keep strong during this pandemic and life as well. You spoke encouraging words, words of strength. And rather than see your respect for our situation, I refused to see this opportunity passed up. </br></br> My name is [redacted]. Before I get into the effects of the pandemic here, it's a must that I say I describe myself as a diamond in the rough, lol. </br></br>Why do I say this? Because! It's crazy that the many people that knows my family upbringing it's sad how a young man could be raised so beautifully yet made stupidest and selfish acts, time after time. </br></br>But if by God’s graces we have an opportunity to search our thoughts please ask questions and you will see why I am a diamond in the rough. </br></br>Allow me to speak a little concerning the pandemic. As a prisoner this was a total shock because no one understood the power of the disease. </br></br>Allow me to take a few steps backwards and make this clear. My love and respect for God is overwhelming. I have been so close to hell; I could smell the smoke and all to my own doings and decisions. Again, my love for the Lord is allowing me to go home soon. </br></br>Yes ladies: Freedom is near. I’ve taken the time to really see that when you act and do what’s right there's only one result: positive. I was just returned here in 2019, now I’ll be home by Halloween. Yes, I am truly blessed. </br></br>Has it been hard? Excuse my French, hell yeah. Not only did I lose my favorite uncle in on March 16, 2021. I was doing good. Really, no excuses and I won’t make any. </br></br> What I’m forwarding this photo to you, so you can see, understand why the diamond in the rough. What I am also is what I call an elder running phenomenon. I’m sending you a couple photos of me in 2019. I was 64 years old. </br></br>I won my first medal 13.5-mile marathon. Now I'll be 66 in May. Yes, in super great shape all thanks be to God.  </br></br>Many ideas and plans for release. Even though it's been less than two years, I have lost very valuable pieces, my uncle to colon cancer, seeing this COVID thing. But I know firsthand how to shake off the pains and push. </br></br> But I also know without patients, my bad patience I meant. The pandemic has not affected my being able to keep conditioned. My real mission is to try to make my own brand like running for cancer patients, kids, elders, or all lives matter. </br></br> I had a motto to kids: obey your parents. All my family has passed due to cancer. But yes, at age soon to be 66 I have a gift for running. My body is my strength. </br></br>But I have allowed myself to make boneheaded choices and the costs have been large and painful. Yet I am an elder blessed with another chance to do something positive for all people. </br></br> So, you have a small sample of my story. Any questions will be welcomed. Ideas, words of advice are very welcomed. </br></br>Yes, the COVID-19 has a scary representation but as you spoke of, one must have strength. Also, prayer, again I am very fortunate to have freedom near. It's sad to see and know some that will never get the chance at freedom. </br></br>But no matter the situation, one thing about Jesus is he’s always near. God bless you all there and your families. Stay strong and prayered up. Prayers go up and blessings come down. </br></br>Thank you for the opportunity. What an honor and blessing. Respectfully.
