To whomever it may concern,</br></br>
A friend of mine received a short letter from someone at UCI and I became interested in writing a little something. First off, my name is [redacted], I’m 26 years old, and a father of two. I’m currently serving a three year sentence for a dirk or dagger.</br></br>
I’ve been down 14 months and should be getting out soon. It has been a difficult journey this time around under this pandemic. I have very little family and the family I do have is hard to communicate with because of financial status. So I’ve been isolated from them this whole term.</br></br>
This is my third time in prison and I pray it’s my last, but it comes down to my choices. It’s very unsafe inside these facilities due to the fact they can't meet CDC guidelines and it’s not sanitary at all. I choose to stay quiet because if I put in a 602 which is a complaint I will be retaliated upon by facility.</br></br>
I’m doing my best to cope by working out three times a day, reading self help book, and minding my own business. It would be nice to have a pen-pal but I know I won’t get a response.</br></br>
Well I exit as I came with love and respect. If you’re curious about what really goes down behind CDCR walls write back. Not typo in person and I’d be willing to expose game to you and your university for whatever purposes.</br></br>
Respectfully.
