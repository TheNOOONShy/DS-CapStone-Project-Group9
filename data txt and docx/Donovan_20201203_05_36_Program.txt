UCI: What has it been like for you to have reduced visitation and-or programming?</br></br> Caller: As far as programming, what has impacted me, myself the most is I am a college student. In fact I am not being able to participate in classroom settings, which has been curtailed because of the pandemic, almost shut down college program entirely.</br></br> 

They had to drastically change the method in which homework was distributed and how br-, everything concerning the college program had to be completely revamped. By itself that was probably one of the biggest program deficit that occurred because of this pandemic.</br></br> UCI: And with this reduced programing how have you been able to cope with the crisis?</br></br> Caller: For myself I've continued to do my studies, my college studies on my own as best I can with the help of the college coordinators.</br></br>  

And as far as self-help groups, I may, actually I'm a facilitator of many groups here in, in the prison environment and we have made overtures to groups and organizations on the streets in order to obtain correspondence-based self-help programs. And once we get them we share them with the inmate population for those individuals wishing to undertake those kind of self-help groups, but that's what I've done myself.
