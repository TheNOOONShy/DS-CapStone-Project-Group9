This story was told by a person incarcerated at Mule Creek.</br></br>

UCI: Okay, and what has the COVID-19 situation been like at your facility?</br></br>

Caller: Terrible. It was terrible actually. It sucked. It was not fun at all. It took a while for, you know, at first it seemed like it was a joke, you know, and like, we thought it would never hit. And then once we heard about, like one of the other prisons getting taken over by it. And, you know, it sucks to say, you know, these guys weren't prepared for it at all.</br></br>

Like, it was like a joke to them. So, they didn't even, you know, really put an effort to really contain it, you know what I mean?</br></br>

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: And then at some point, we're like, you know, still thinking, that this isn't real. No one's really even caught it here yet. But when it did it hit like wildfire, you know. And for the most part we've, we thought it was one of the cops who, well it had to be somebody from the outside that brought it in, you know, clearly.</br></br>

So it had to have been one of the cops that brought it in, you know, and there's, they were during this whole pandemic thing, you know, they, you know, they search ourselves every now and then, right?</br></br>

UCI: Uh-huh.</br></br>

Caller: So, you know, they were, they're allowing these officers to search our cells while we're, while we're on this whole scare of the pandemic, right. And we're all like, "Why would they do that?" You know, at some point, you know, a lot of us have paranoia, paranoia, thoughts about, you know, being set up, and being, having stuff placed in our cells.</br></br>

You know, so one, it's not far fetched for one person to think, "Well how easy would it be for them to put something in there?" While they're searching, you know, cough on our bedding or whatever, for whatever reason. It's just the weird things that go through your head in here, you know?</br></br>

UCI: Yeah. Wow.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah. So, you know, it's, like I said, it's very weird to think, you know, people are doing stuff to your cell, and a lot of times, it's not just prison that this happens, but other places. It's a thing where, you know, cops sometimes do stuff like that. So it's not, it's not that far fetched for some of us to go way out with it like that.</br></br>

But I feel like others feel like that that's how it started, you know, one cop searching and apparently I think he tested positive. And we're all wondering, why are they allowing this person to still do cell searches? You know what I mean?
