This story was told by a person incarcerated at Los Angeles County Men’s Central Jail.</br></br>

UCI: Okay. Well, is there anything else you want people to know about your experience?</br></br>

Caller: We, here, - we here - and where I'm at, it's called, "high power." And I've been in high power ten years. It's isolated.</br></br>

It's isolation. It's one-man cells. And these one-man cells – my parents' bathroom is bigger than them. But they're open in the front.</br></br>

And, if one person catches COVID in here, nine times out of ten, it's gonna spread like wildfire. And that has happened – where it literally – you could tell how it spread, from back to front, through the tier. We – I would like for anybody that has any ideas that would help us just to get proper treatment, proper care, and dealing with our food, our shower situation, our visitation.</br></br>

Because our families haven't seen us over years. Like I said, I've been here ten years. And I had family members pass away who literally wanted to come talk to me before they passed away and couldn't.</br></br>

So I'm - we're looking for anybody that can help us, that can help us out of having to live in fear of catching COVID and dealing with passing, spreading, and just going to the hospital.</br></br> 

I have asthma. I have asthma real bad. And for me to catch COVID is - is scary in itself. So I'm going – I literally have to hang up plastic in front of my cell and keep my cell covered up with blankets and plastic just because I don't want people talking and spitting and spraying.</br></br>

And because they have people that throw feces. They got people that throw urine. They have a lot of mental cases that come through here as well.</br></br>

So we have to literally take precautions on ourself. And dealing with our cases and dealing with actually living and surviving in here, we shouldn't have to do that. I'm a pre-trial detainee.</br></br>

And I shouldn't have to live as if I have to fight for my life and on a day to day basis, as well as fight for my life in court. I should have - I should be able to work with my lawyers and concentrate on my case and concentrating on dealing with my - and concentrating on dealing with my legal affairs. I cannot do that here.</br></br>

This is - this is extremely – you can see the stress level and everything else that it's causing on people here. So I just want to let people know, if they can help us in any way, I would - it would really much be appreciated.
