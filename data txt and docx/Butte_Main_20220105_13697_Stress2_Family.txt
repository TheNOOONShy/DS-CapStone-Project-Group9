This story was told by a person incarcerated at Butte County Main Jail.</br></br>

UCI: How has the COVID situation at your facility affected your loved ones?</br></br>

Caller: Well, I could tell you that it’s affected everyone’s loved ones in here. It’s like, everyone’s loved ones are dying. And mostly, people are not caring no more and they just - basically, everyone’s getting violent.</br></br>

UCI: Violent? Can you elaborate on that?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah. Well, so, if your mom and dad dies, or your grandma and grandpa dies, then you have nothing else in the world. So, therefore, you just don’t care no more. So you just wild out and you start beating people up for no reason. And there’s been a lot of that around this county jail.</br></br>

UCI: Wow. Has that, like, have you ever been involved in something like that? Where people have come and attacked you or anything?</br></br>

Caller: No, not me. But, I’m probably the biggest dude in the block, so I don’t think no one’s gonna attack me, you know?</br></br>

UCI: I get you.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, so they attack other people. And it's sad to see people’s loved ones dying, and then people not caring no more. So, yeah, the pandemic has gratefully affected the struggle, you know?
