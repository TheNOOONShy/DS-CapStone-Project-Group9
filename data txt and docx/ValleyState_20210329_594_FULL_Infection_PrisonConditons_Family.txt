This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Valley State.</br></br>Dear PrisonPandemic,</br></br>Hello. Someone shared your letter and address with me. As far as COVID-19, the prison put positive people in rooms with all negative people in order to spread it to get over it. For me its been horrible.</br></br> 

Worse time in my 22 years has been to the lockdowns isolations, no phone calls in isolation. They even hold your mail. My safety there is none. They put positive COVID-19 people in with negatives on purpose.</br></br>A year without visiting it’s terrible, horrible, completely anti-rehabilitative. Goes to show how full of shit the prison system is. Coping, well I have like a turtle pulled into myself, but I feel like I lost part of me.</br></br>I was told I was positive November 21st. They had moved me once November 19th when two of my roommates tested positive after they put a positive guy in our room. All the mask wearing fake social distancing. I never did catch it until they put a positive guy in our room.</br></br>

Prior to testing positive due to them putting a positive guy in my room. We had been on another fake lockdown.</br></br> So, no phone calls. Kept asking to call my mom, make an emergency call. They wouldn’t let me. I get moved on November 19th; the test results came back positive. I got moved November 21st, the COVID-19 positive building.</br></br> 

December 3rd, I get moved to resolved building. Then December 4th I’m called out to be told to call my sister for a few minutes.</br></br>My sister informed me my mom had passed that morning. It had been about two months or since I could talk to her. She was scheduled to see me the day the prison system suspended visiting.</br></br> 

March 14th, 2020, I believe. A friend of mine attempted suicide after a 60-day lockdown, no movement.</br></br>They packed us in eight per room. We are still at 200 percent capacity, most rooms have eight dudes in there. I don’t know about the vaccinations. Everyone, well most get sick on the first or the second dose.</br></br>

Why should I take it when I was already so sick? I was very sick. Denied even Tylenol. They said they couldn’t give me anything because they wanted to see if I get a fever or not.</br></br> 

Bull shit.</br></br>Anyways. I hope this helps. Can someone sue the prison for what they did please. Thank you.
