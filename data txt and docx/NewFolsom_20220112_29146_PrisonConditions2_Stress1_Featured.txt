This story was told by a person incarcerated at New Folsom.</br></br> 

Caller: And this is what don't make sense, this is why I'm an in-prison advocate for myself, or I advocate the population that I am currently in, and that kind of puts me in a fucked up position.</br></br> 

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: Because I get targeted by the correctional officers so when it came to visiting, this is what didn't make sense. They took our visits because of COVID, saying we might catch COVID from our family members, friends, or whoever comes visit us. But yet, they're allowing staff members to come around us and handle our food, escort us to here and there. That didn't make sense. You know what I am saying?</br></br>

UCI: Yeah. It doesn't.</br></br>

Caller: How can you - exactly. So now, you know, there is another uproar about that, and we're in talks about doing a hunger strike so we can - so we can make statewide attention. Hopefully, the news or something, you know, Sacramento can understand. I don't even think Sacramento knows what's going on.</br></br>

Sometimes this prison don't report shit. They like to keep things under wraps and keep it isolated. But we're thinking about a hunger strike so we can, you know, get it on the news, get, you know, statewide attention of what's going on here because it's just not making sense on what's going on. I mean, it's like we're being treated as subhuman or something like -</br></br> 

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: It is crazy, yeah. So yeah, the visits, you know, they, you know, anything that they can take from us or any reason, you know, it's less work for them. You know, that's less work, take the visits, put us on lockdown, no program, you know, any excuse - any excuse to take anything. But yet, they are allowing staff members to handle our food, and they are not vaccinated.</br></br>

They're, you know, they come in every time a COVID outbreak happens. A staff member brung it in. A staff member it came from a staff member. We are on lockdown right now.</br></br> 

It came from a staff member. But yet, we can't see our family members at visits. We can't kiss our family members even if we have a mask on.</br></br>
 
We have to sit across the table from each other, but yet correctional officers come in here with this shit, handle our food, escort us from here and there, putting their hand on us to escort us, and you know, grab our arm. I mean, it doesnâ€™t make sense.
