This story was told by a person incarcerated at Soledad.</br></br>

Caller: A judge's ruling that they have to get people out for emergency medical transports. So what they do is if somebody has like a heart attack, instead of have staff for it, have it always staffed like that, they shut down the yard, the recreational yard, which is the biggest program. At every prison across the state.</br></br>

So they'll take the yard officers and put them in medical so they can do the medical transport instead of just hiring the right amount of police for medical. And so all the facilities suffer 'cause some days they'll have two or three medical runs. So they close all the rec yards and then they start closing buildings.</br></br>

And what I mean by closing building is they lock everybody up and there's only one officer in the building so there's no program in the building, and then if it's too many staff gone, then there's no church, there's nothing, you know. You just sit in your cell. So it's all right when football season and Olympics are happening, but when that ain't happening, you know, people want to move around 'cause that's the mental health function in it, you know, to move around.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>

Caller: So that's a, I mean, in a nutshell, it's totally different than it was last year, but it's still some things that need to be refined. They gotta single cell these prisons. There's no way in the world that you're gonna beat COVID in here unless you isolate yourself. Like I don't socialize with a lot of people.</br></br>

And I've never caught COVID, but there's a lot of people that catch it, and they don't realize that some people it affects differently. And then, you know, guys have weird things going on with their body that they don't know about, you know?</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>

Caller: You know, we have inmates that refuse the vaccine, but that's not good because then when they get sick, they get really sick. So.
