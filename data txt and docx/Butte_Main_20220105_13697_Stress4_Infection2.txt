This story was told by a person incarcerated at Butte County Main Jail.</br></br>

UCI: How have you been coping with the crisis?</br></br>

Caller: Well, basically all I do is draw. I sit in my cell and draw, and I try not to think about nothing else in the world, you know? I even wrote a book, a COVID book.</br></br>

UCI: You wrote a COVID book?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, I wrote a COVID book. It’s called [redacted].</br></br>

UCI: And what is it about?</br></br>

Caller: It’s about a little clown and a little clown girl that - basically, talking about the COVID and what it did to them when they were locked up. But it's not like, being locked up, but like, in general. Like, it’s a little blue clown.</br></br> 

It start's off with "Hey, my buddy, my friend, my pal, why you look so down?" It used to be such a happy clown. And then it goes on because COVID flu, you know, he lost all his loved ones. "You know, my grandma and grandpa, mom and dad too. So that's, now you know why I’m so blue."</br></br>

As my story continues, he goes from being a blue clown and starts beginning to be positive in life and he turns into a golden clown. And he changes colors as the story goes, and he finds God and he’s a golden, shiny clown now, because he found God. And it just tells the story about what the COVID flu did to him, you know. Which the clown is me.</br></br>

UCI: Wow. That's-</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, and I have it.</br></br>

UCI: Go ahead.</br></br>

Caller: And I wrote it for kids. It’s a kid, a COVID flu book for kids, you know.</br></br>

UCI: Wow, that’s really moving. And you said you represent the clown in a sense? Like you relate to it?</br></br>

Caller: Yes. My grandma died of COVID, I have no father, I have no grandpa. I’m in here. My sister takes care of me, somewhat, whenever she can, but basically, I’ve been locked up for over 40 – I’m 41 years old, and I’m on – court records, I’ve been sentenced to 47 years.</br></br>

UCI: Wow.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, so I’ve been in here most of my life, you know? So, I know a lot. Like, prisons, what goes on in prison and how it affects people.</br></br> 

My brother died while I was in here, and ever since that, I’ve stopped caring. And I’ve been doing this my whole life, you know?
