Yes difficult for all of us being in here with all this COVID going on our people cannot even come and visit us and some of us lost family members. I am blessed that my people did not even get sick thank to God. But I did have COVID but I did not get that sick. I had to be in my cell for two weeks had to get tested every three days that sucks.</br></br>

Okay when this pandemic started  I was sad because I did not want to lose a family member so I started reading books and working out more that helped me out a lot. And about visitation, did not like it because they stopped our loved ones from coming and seeing us so every time when the weekend came I got sad but the good thing is that our people can come for 45 minutes and now we are waiting for June so our people can come and see us all day.</br></br>

The good thing is that this facility is doing the best they can do. By the way the vaccinations are going good everybody and myself got the vaccine.</br></br> 

Your friend.
