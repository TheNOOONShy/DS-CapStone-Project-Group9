This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Donovan. </br></br>

Real quick,</br></br> 

What I’m expressing is the truth no doubt REAL business. So take what you will, and if you choose to use my name or post on PrisonPandemic, cool, but moreover I hope you will POST WITH AMENDUS.ORG AND THE MARSHALL PROJECT. Quickly keep in mind while reading this, I took the liberty of acquiring the many declarations of those inmates willing to step forward as to what they witnessed and survived the first hand! I think we owe it to the families of those that died here.</br></br>

On December 9th we here at RJD experienced a COVID-19 outbreak. It started in unit 1 and 2 on facility A level III-SNY. The administration took the steps necessary at first to try to contain the situation.</br></br>

They quarantined all those infected in the units 1 and 2, but then free staff in the main kitchen brought in more infections to the inmate workers in units 3, 4, and 5. On December 15th, in my unit alone approximately 30 tested, myself included. By December 17th, the test results return showing that four of the kitchen workers in my unit tested positive!! Along with several others located in units 5 and 3.</br></br> 

At this point the system FAILED. The CDCR did NOTHING WITH THESE INMATES - nor did they rehouse them. They slapped a “red tag” on their doors, and that was it! They were still allowed to come out of their cells, USE THE PHONES, share THE SHOWERS, and TOUCH THE RAILS!!</br></br>

By 12-17-20 the ENTIRE HOUSING UNIT(S) WERE INFECTED. 3, 4, and 5. The units EXPLODED with COVID-19. Over 500 inmates EXPERIENCED COVID infections (not to mention the pre-existing infections mentioned in units and 2). In my unit 4, I was infected with COVID just two days AFTER TESTING NEGATIVE!!! </br></br>

The CDCR is lying to the media!! They are releasing numbers that are missing the force of truth, and statistical numbers - because THEY NEVER ACTUALLY CAME BACK TO TEST DURING the OUTBREAK!! What commenced straight after the outbreak WAS THE SINGLE GREATEST HUMANITARIAN CRISIS I WITNESSED IN 30 YEARS OF INCARCERATION.</br></br>

After the COVID-19 exploded, we witnessed many officers get stricken with COVID (while many others failed to report). Normally there's approximately 28 to 30 officers per WATCH on every yard - during 12-17-20 and 12-29-20, there WAS NOT MORE than 10 officers in this facility on any watch (that's five officers to man the gun towers and five officers for 900+ inmates). This prison WAS A GHOST TOWN !</br></br> 

In my unit alone, we lost five inmates, DEAD!! With three more still hospitalized with serious medical concerns. The last three weeks, this prison TOTAL lost over 20+ inmates and the SAME EXPLOSION OCCURRED ON EVERY YARD!! Literally thousands were infected!!!</br></br>

Now the collapse and failure to PROTECT. On 12-20-20 I personally went man down. I'm 49 years old with chronic asthma and bronchitis. I reported chills, fever, shortness of breath, and vomiting, this occurred at 7:45 p.m.</br></br> 

When the nurse arrived, she did my vitals and mentioned that my oxygen levels were “acceptable” - then shockingly spoke these words: “Mr, we have a packed infirmary, we are overwhelmed, and we can't do anything for you. They're not gonna give you medications. I'm suggesting you go back to your cell, lay down, and rest”.</br></br>  

She handed me a BLANK medical refusal form and asked me to sign it - and said she would report it as “food poisoning”!!! And guess what? THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED!! Now this repeated itself with numerous other inmates. As medical alarm after alarm sounded throughout the yards. They knowingly returned me back COVID positive.</br></br>

I had anticipated something like this happening here, and back in November had filed with the SD Superior Court on WRIT. But they dismissed my claimed as speculative!! And took no action!!! Human beings DIED!!</br></br>

In the families that lost their loved ones DESERVE to know the truth! I will never stop until that truth is heard!!! We, all of us in CDCR, remain in at great risk (even if you have contracted COVID-19!!). There is NO IMMUNITY!! Your body only carries the ANTIBODIES for 90 to 120 days! Then you are susceptible ALL OVER AGAIN!!</br></br>

Especially with the variants STRAINS!!! That vaccine I recommend people take. I almost died in MY CELL. But the truth is, THAT VACCINE ONLY GIVES YOU IMMUNITY for 120 to 150 days!!! From the time the LAST SHOT IS ADMINISTERED!! So you will have to take it TWICE EACH YEAR!! Which is double that of the FLU vaccine!!</br></br>

So we need to start having serious conversations in SACRAMENTO about releasing offenders. Especially those of us that have been incarcerated some 27 to 30+ years and have paid full retribution for our controlling offense.</br></br> 

I am a non-violent offender (with absolutely no victim) sentenced to 27 to life back in 1994, for simple possession, not use!! I have done the work, been dispo-free now three years, yet got a seven-year denial (pre-COVID-19) back in 9-6-19. And when I petitioned the BPH, they denied the PTA within 72 hours of that time stamp!!!</br></br>

It's really incredible. These people are misrepresenting acts, lying to the media, and then blaming us after we have already done the time!!! It's dehumanizing and lethal as they continue to play games with this virus. I wish everyone to be safe. PEACE.</br></br>
