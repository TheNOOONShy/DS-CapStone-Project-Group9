Dear PrisonPandemic,</br></br>


I received a letter from you, well at least I think so because the envelope had your name. So it’s pretty much a guessing game.</br></br>


I’ve been in prison for 27 years. Since I was 19 years old. I am 46 now. When the pandemic we basically went on modified program.</br></br>


There are five housing buildings on the yard. Since last April we only program with our building. I work in the PIA Laundry. I am a critical worker.</br></br>


I worked six days a week from April 2020 until mid Dec. 2020. No one had gotten COVID until then. In Dec. 2020 all hell broke loose.</br></br>


I lived in four blk but all four blk was moved to either two or five blk. They had a really big outbreak in one blk and three blk. (blk - block or building)</br></br>


There are about 200 inmates per blk. In one blk about 100 inmates got COVID. In three blk about 50 inmates got sick. On Jan. 26 my blk (two blk) went on quarantine due to two inmates getting sick.</br></br>


A couple of days later the whole yard broke out on COVID really bad. Just about every inmate in five blk got sick. 170 out of 200 got sick in three blk and about 140 got sick in my blk which in two blk.</br></br>


As of right now, one and five blk are for inmates who already have had COVID. 3 blk is for people who are sick with COVID. 4 blk is for overflow of COVD positive tests and two blk is for people who have not been sick.</br></br>


Now comes the sad part. We have had several inmates get COVID in two blk in the last month and a half. These correctional officers don’t give a rats ass who gets sick. They’re running phone calls for inmates and people keep getting sick.</br></br>


All of the inmates who were in charge of passing out meals all got COVID. I have not left my cell since Jan. 26 except for four times. I don’t want to leave my cell out of fear that I might get sick.</br></br>


They test us for COVID when ever they feel like it. We go weeks sometimes without a COVID test even though people around us get sick.</br></br>


I think that the only positive thing that has come from all of this is that I knocked out two college courses in three weeks. I’ve had all day to focus on my college work.</br></br>


I guess only time will tell on what will happen. I do not want a vaccine shot. I don’t trust the government.</br></br>


Well that’s all I have for now. Thank you for taking the time to write me.</br></br>


Respectfully.
