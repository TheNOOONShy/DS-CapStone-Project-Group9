This story was told by a person incarcerated at Chuckwalla.</br></br>

UCI: Is the situation being handled differently now?</br></br>

Caller: No, it continues the same, it continues the same. Once, once the turnover of the unit, once one building is infected, they move all that building to another building, and it just goes back and forth. It just goes back and forth, back and forth, back and forth from different buildings.</br></br>

UCI: UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>

Caller: So actually, it's just a turn around like if a medical is infecting you on their own. My building can go in there and be removed within the 14-day period, and another building goes in there, and they're in there for a 14-day period, and it just constantly coming from other yards, other facilities. There’s only one housing unit being used for the observation of COVID.</br></br> 

UCI: UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>

Caller: But every facility uses that same housing unit.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah. Okay, and what do you think would make the situation at your facility better?</br></br>

Caller: If public health departments were to come in and overlook how medical is doing.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm. Okay, and how has the COVID-19 situation at your facility, affected your loved ones?</br></br>

Caller: Well, because of the fact that there’s no visiting and so on like that, yeah, it’s been going on a year already or nine months or so, and they’re just about now starting to put in the Skype plans. They’re barely installing the Skype, you know, for family viewings.</br></br>

UCI: Oh, okay.</br></br>

Caller: Through the Skype, you know?
