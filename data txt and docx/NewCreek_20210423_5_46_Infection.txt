This story was told by a person incarcerated at New Creek.</br></br>Caller: Right now, we are way over half right now, the population right now. We did some shots today. We did 85 shots today. We right now, we doing right now, this prison is that we getting the people who had better shoes and stuff.</br></br>Now, they have to wait 90 days to get vaccinated so when time is up, they get their first shot. I say, up here where I’m at, we got like maybe 25, 40 people left in the yard I’m on right now, for the whole yard to be vaccinated. They’ve been doing a good job at New Creek. They’ve been doing a real good job, you know.</br></br>Staff is taking care of us very well. People like to know and we’ve been working with them and stuff. Staff is getting their shots and stuff so the main thing is a lot of inmates have been wondering like, “Okay, well staff don’t have to get shots, why do we have to get shots?”</br></br>You know, my thing is that we ain’t them and they ain’t us. You know, we have to look out for one another. You know, it’s coming in, but with the vaccination, it helps slow stuff down and for a lot of guys that took their shots, you know, they want it, but they’re doing it. They give us opportunity to make it up.</br></br>Say that three or four people refuse like two or three months ago, well they got another chance of signing up again and getting it again, you know. So, it’s a blessing to do that. It’s really really a blessing. It’s been helping a lot of people.</br></br>The outbreak was pretty bad here at New Creek if you heard about it. It was pretty bad here, you know. It put some people down. Some good friends of mine. But yeah, you know, I’m working through it. Every day I count my blessing, you know.
