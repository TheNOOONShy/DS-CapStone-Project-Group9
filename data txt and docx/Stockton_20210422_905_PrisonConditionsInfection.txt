This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Stockton.</br></br>
Well, here’s where this brief letter does come to a close. I very much hope that I have done some purpose to your present pandemic, or have done some good to allow those who have never experienced such horrors. As being a COVID-19 patient and or incarcerated prisoner, where the nurses profession is more caring what is placed online to place an order over t
the employees computer than to serve and or care for an in prison patient.</br></br>
Allow me to thank you for your time and effort and hopes and sharing the truth of COVID-19 while being incarcerated from our point of view. Except there have been many unseen horrors and one that is known as being tortured, destroyed, or sacrificed under any of various conditions of this virus known as COVID-19.</br></br>
One that is subjected to oppression, hardship, or even miss treatment and for this, they have paid with their lives. Only known as victims, and those that they do not care for. Simply due to the fact that they were incarcerated prisoners or societies worst. Just another form of racial prejudice or discrimination. Simply due to the color of their skin and due to the majority of people incarcerated are either Mexican, brown, or Afro American.</br></br>
Perhaps some good will come out of my writings. Only to know that no one really cares, just as long as it is not happening to them or to their family members. Be reminded that bad karma is not prejudice. I am sorry for being late.</br></br>
Something to always remember!
