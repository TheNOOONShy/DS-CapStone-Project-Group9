Hi,</br></br>

I saw your flyer and thought I'd reach out cuz our voices do need to be heard. I'm 47, serving time for a non-violent crime.</br></br>

I'm high-risk medical with six years in and two to go if I make through this prison pandemic. COVID-19 will kill me. And once it hits a prison, it spreads like wildfire.</br></br>

At this moment my whole building is on quarantine again for 14 days. Inmates wear cloth masks we made ourselves. The cops wear theirs half the time when they will be the way COVID-19 is brought in then spread to the prison pop.</br></br>

What has it been like to be inside during this time? It's been stressful, worried about my family, my mother (sick with cancer).</br></br>

You can only imagine how I feel. I might not see or hold her again and I have to live with the fact that I put myself in here. Since COVID-19, visiting our family is shut down, going on a year of no visits.</br></br>

How do I feel about my safety inside? Honestly, I'm not safe at all.</br></br>

I feel like a sitting duck waiting for COVID-19 to end my life. Cops don't wear masks.</br></br>

What has it been like to have reduced visitation from family and loved ones? There is no visits at all. The adults can handle it but my daughter wants to see her dad.</br></br>

My girlfriend, it's hard on us and our relationship. We need contact, closeness with each other. Phone calls cost a lot of money and our family are already struggling.</br></br>

How have I been coping with this crisis? There's nothing I can do. I try but it's hard on all of us.</br></br>

Everyone is falling deeper into depression with suicide thoughts. The stress level in here is higher than ever.</br></br>

I don't want my voice to remain anonymous. I hope I've helped.</br></br>

Thank you.
