This story was told by a person incarcerated at El Dorado County Jail.</br></br>

UCI: And how has the COVID situation been like at your facility?</br></br>

Caller: Well, every person who I've met, who is sentenced, has caught COVID.</br></br>

UCI: Oh, wow.</br></br>

Caller: And I don't know if the local news have been alerted to this or not, but the numbers that are reporting are way below the — the population here. So, South Lake Tahoe facility is sort of like the overflow for the Placerville Jail. When inmates become sentenced, they're more often than not, moved to the — the Tahoe Jail.</br></br>

UCI: Mhm.</br></br>

Caller: So in El Dorado County, now, I don't know if this is — don't quote me on this, but the jail staff, they get time and a half pay. And they're not required to be vaccinated. And they come and go freely or, I mean, every day — every day they come and go, without having to quarantine, without having to, you know, be tested.</br></br> 

But inmates are required to be quarantined for two weeks, whether they're vaccinated or not. And what quarantine is — is that means we're locked in a cell 24 hours a day for two weeks.</br></br>

UCI: Mhm. Are you — are you locked with other people in the cell as well?</br></br>

Caller: Yes.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah?</br></br>

Caller: So — and here's — here's the irony, right? It's - so they're not required to — the staff is not required to get vaccinated. So, they're the carriers. They come and infect us, collect the time and a half pay, and then we're suffering from it.</br></br>

UCI: Mhm. Have you — have you personally caught COVID?</br></br>

Caller: So I was vaccinated.</br></br>

UCI: Mhm.</br></br>

Caller: About seven months ago, and I tested negative, but I did — I did get sick, but I did test not — negative.</br></br>

UCI: Mhm.</br></br>

Caller: But I — I tested negative three different times, but every — I — let me put it this way. I've not met another inmate that didn't catch it.</br></br>

UCI: Mhm.</br></br>

Caller: And supposedly, I mean, it's coming from the staff that aren't getting vaccinated. They're carry — they're carrying it here and they're infecting us.
