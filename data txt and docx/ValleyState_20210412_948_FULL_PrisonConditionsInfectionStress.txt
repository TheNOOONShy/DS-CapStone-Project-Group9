Dear PrisonPandemic,</br></br>

Thank you for writing me and during this pandemic we have been quarantined and are still on a modified program. I'm still allowed to go to work and get canteen and some yard and dayroom. I play the guitar and have been teaching others for 17 years. When they finally start playing it makes me feel good that I’m giving back and teaching guitar is my passion.</br></br>

It's strange how a bad place to be can show you some good. I was struck with COVID-19 in late September and because of my age and underlying conditions I was sent to the hospital two times and still have some lingering effects.</br></br>

But all in all we just don’t have the capacity to social distance. We live in eight man pods and they have tried to make it safer. We have to wear a mask at all times when out of the room.</br></br>

I’m sending you a song I wrote and it’s about being lost in this place and missing out on life and your loved ones. Once again I hope this letter helps and thank you for writing me.</br></br>

Sincerely.</br></br>

Why</br></br>

Waiting for the lonely road to end</br></br>

Waiting for the chance to live again</br></br>

So much has come and left me cold</br></br>

And still I just don’t know</br></br>

With</br></br>

Waiting for the dawn of a brand new day</br></br>

With the things I lost</br></br>

When the words got in the way</br></br>

I know something's gotta change</br></br>

And still I just don’t know</br></br>

Why</br></br>

I can see your smile in that picture on the wall</br></br>

I’m lost in the memories and the sadness of it all</br></br>

And still I know that you’re so far away</br></br>

So please come back someday</br></br>

Through all the pain and all the tears</br></br>

The broken dreams the wasted years</br></br>

When life has passed us by</br></br>

And still we just don’t know</br></br>

Why.
