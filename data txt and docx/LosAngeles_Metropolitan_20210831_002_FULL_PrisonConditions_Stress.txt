This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Metropolitan Detention Center.</br></br>

I am currently in a federal jail. I have gotten your information from another inmate you wrote to. I don’t know how far this will go or if you even care.</br></br>

The pandemic has been the worst thing for prisoners in jail right now. The federal courts have abandoned the constitution completely and blamed on the pandemic, and is violating everyone in the courts right now.</br></br>

I have recently lost in trial and the court completely violated my rights. There was misconduct in my case where Los Angeles Police Department did a lot of misconduct in my case. I contacted everyone, the mayor, district attorney, internal affairs, the governor, and inspector general and it was quiet. Because of my case, which I am innocent of, is not a good one for the public, they just violated rights and no one cares.</br></br>

I brought it up to the district court. They basically told me, you have no right. The government made sure the victim/witness didn’t come to trial so they can wing their own theory.</br></br>

I have been fighting this case since 2011. I have reached out to anyone who would listen. I have also filed a lawsuit to get the attention of law because these officers shouldn’t be able to get away with this.</br></br>

I mean if you want to post my story which has been happening during the pandemic. My case happen in 2011.</br></br>

I am also sending you a copy of one of these officers who was the lead detective on my case has violated someone's rights before and of course gotten away with it. But the COVID has been the worse, we can’t get visits so the stress is at an all-time high.</br></br> 

And if the officers were found wrong on the court they wouldn’t get in trouble. This whole system is not fair. I am sure you don’t care but I am telling everyone who will listen.
