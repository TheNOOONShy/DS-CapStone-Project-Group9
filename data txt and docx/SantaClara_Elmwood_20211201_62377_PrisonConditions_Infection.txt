This story was told by a person incarcerated at Elmwood Correctional Facility.</br></br>

Caller: But that’s a good thing to leave open in case they – we did have another big outbreak. Like we had one in January according to the newspapers and stuff. So this was equal to that. And so we – they transported us in – on vans, and had sterilizing guys.</br></br>

It was like Ghostbusters outfits on. With you know, big hoses and pumps and tanks on; sterilizing everything everywhere. Trying to make – keep up on their homework.</br></br>

And quarantine for 10 to 15 days downtown was fine. And then when that was up we got shoveled to another unit all in the same unit – it was the same four guys. Was interesting how the – how CDC was using it – doing what they know how to do, you know.</br></br>

And so we go shoveled to a different unit, but all the same like one, two, three, four was all the same guys that – like same order they took us. They kept us like that, like lined up next to each other amongst – instead of spreading us out through the whole unit.</br></br>

And we were – we were in an empty unit – by then, by the time we got done with our quarantine. They – everybody else in the whole place was already gone waiting for theirs to be up. So it was interesting how it was a ghost camp when we came back.</br></br>

But they - they ran out of room downtown and they had to move one unit. One guy next to me into – make a two-man tank out of one, in one. But so we were - I had bungee all of a sudden.</br></br>

I went, “well that’s kinda interesting,” I thought they were trying to keep us in separate – they really wanted to keep certain groups away from certain groups. You know, somehow the process is kind of mysterious. At that point, it’s just  interesting you know?</br></br>

So when our 10 days were up, we came back it ended up being the same – the kid that I was in a cell with, he was going to a THU, traditional housing unit, like I was. And we were both waiting for beds; it was coincidental. Kind of interesting and cool, you know?
