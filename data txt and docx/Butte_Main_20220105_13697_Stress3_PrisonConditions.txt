UCI: What would you have made the situation at your facility better?</br></br>

Caller: I mean, they should have, I really [unintelligible], have video visits would be nice. They had them here before, then they took them. And then so people can see their loved ones, at least through video.</br></br>

They have us locked down in our cells 22 hours a day. We come out for two hours a day. We’re basically in our cells all the time. With people dying and stuff, like that doesn’t help.</br></br>

It just makes people think about it, and they get angrier, and angrier, and angrier. I’ve been in a cell most of my life, and ever since my brother passed away, I've been - I was a violent, violent person.</br></br>

But, as I got older, I kind of like, shied away from that, and started drawing and working out. So, I work out a lot to console that anger, you know?
