This letter was written by someone incarcerated at Mule Creek.</br></br>To PrisonPandemic, I received your letter April 22, 2021. From the beginning of government involvement of personal medical death until now where they will struggle to get immunity through a vaccine I worried how long my prayers would last. I pray daily mostly non-verbally. I am in an environment of government operation. When that environment is new CDCR uses control. So to know there is an archive in Irvine thank heavens.</br></br> The state’s best response is record. My criminal record began at the state level in 1986. Here goes my convictions, 1986: burglary and armed robbery, 1990: attempted burglary, 1993: assault with a deadly weapon, 2000: corporal injury to a spouse, 2005: murder lying in wait, 1990-2002: seven probation/parole violations.</br></br>Since 1986 has not been free of a prison on jail for over a year straight. I’m 1989-90 so I graduated high school. I played varsity basketball for high school in Tacna, Arizona, Yuma County. My highest point total for a single game was 31 I missed two shots. I am only six feet tall I was a guard. Trust me eight minute quarters 31 points is a peaceful thought.</br></br>Back to the pandemic. My mother died of stroke at 74 years of age in 2020. She was in Oregon! Without a doubt the testing has to be mobile and done in large numbers like I witnessed here in prison early on. Bed movers of the infected at Mule Creek was done horrible.</br></br>
