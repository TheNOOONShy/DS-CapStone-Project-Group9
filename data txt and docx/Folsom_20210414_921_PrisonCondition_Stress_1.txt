So when this COVID 19 pandemic hit the US, we all figured will be relatively unaffected in prison. In my mind, I thought we were one of the safest populations due to the minimal and limited contact with the outside. Boy was I mistaken. Turns out we’re one of the most vulnerable. Well, at least one of the most vulnerable here in California.</br></br>

Primarily because of the crowded institutions and the way our programs are structured for yard, chow, were assignments etc. Most things are done in massive. But that is only relevant with spreading the virus. The only contributions factors for contracting the virus was the prison staff.</br></br>

The virus was introduced, it spread like wildfire. To be fair, old (redacted) State Prison was not designed, and not equipped to deal with something like COVID 19. The measures taken by staff to combat the spread of the virus were-futile and few in between as a whole sent out the new guidelines state wide. It appeared to have the right intentions.</br></br>

For the US here in (redacted), things have finally become better. We’re still on a modified program, which means we’re on lockdown in all but name. Currently, I'm in administration segregation, the hole, and we seem to have more recreational time then the general pop. We are all in single men cells, here in ad-seg, and have individual walk alone yards. You would think us safest from exposure right?</br></br>

On the contrary, we are put at risk almost daily. The building where we are housed in has three floors. Each floor has two tiers running parallel. (redacted) are used for ad-seg inmates. (redacted) is used to house the positive COVID cases. So if and when an inmate tests positive from anywhere in the prison, they are housed in (redacted).
