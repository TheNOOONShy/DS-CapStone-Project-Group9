This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Donovan.</br></br>
                                                                                                                                             
My name is inmate and I am an ADA/DPO elderly inmate. I was tested for COVID-19 on December 19, 2020 and again on December 15, 2020, and both were negative.</br></br>

I put in a CDCR 7362 two days later on 12-17-20, as I was not sure if I was getting a cold. So on 12-20-2020, I went to the TTA nurse and she swabbed me for the influenza A/B and the COVID-19 virus.</br></br>

The TTA nurse called ahead and told the floor CO in the building, an ADA/DPO assigned building. That just started putting in the overflow of CTQ patients for COVID-19 here, and that was a precautionary measure to isolate me and pink placard me CTQ for 14 days.</br></br>

On 12-24-20, with me not receiving the 12-20-20 TTA COVID test, at 9 p.m. I am/was by myself, at night sergeant forced a known tested positive COVID-19 inmate from building and with hepatitis-C, on me. And I have CODP, hypertension, blocked vena cava, and no spleen (so immunocompromised).</br></br>

Sergeant said he called the TTA nurse, and she/he said I tested positive on previous Sunday for COVID-19? But I had no symptoms, so I either take this blocked COVID-19 inmate now (foreseeable harm) or go to the hole where I'll catch COVID-19.</br></br>

I was on CTQ for 14 days along with this new cellmate who had COVID-19 and hep-C.</br></br>
 
There is no way a six foot social distancing by this forced double ceiling. I do not believe I had COVID-19, and the sergeant's conclusionary doctored test results I was positive was. BS.</br></br>

Medical and M. Pollard has failed to protect me from six-foot social distancing, COVID-19 double-ceiling tactics at Richard J. Donovan, along with IHA officials and lieutenant/captain of A yard, a ADA/DPO and mental health yard.</br></br>

Buildings A-1 and A-2 were first put on isolation lockdown on COVID-19, then IHA and officials designated A-3 isolation as a COVID-19 and CTQ building. They moved ADA/DPOs to building five. Then, designated A-5 ADA/DPO until they switched to A-4, as an isolation ADA/DPO building, and moved positive COVID-19 inmates to A-4 C section, on CTQ.</br></br>

On January 6, 2021, the Division of Adult Institutions (DAI) ended the statewide program modification effective January 7, 2021. Yet the isolation buildings A-1, A-4, B-Gym, C-Gym, D-Gym, E-Gym remain on no program due to the warden's illegal making/changing to quarters (CTQ) order to A-2-D-20. And those off CTQ and have gone through the 14-day isolation, are now not allowed day room and yard exercise 'cause A-2 was designated isolation building by warden.</br></br>

The warden illegally forced those who tested (so-called) positive, will be moved to isolation building A-4 or face/duress of RVR 115 and put on SOMS 128-b file.</br></br>

I have heard CDCR and RJD is lying to us all about COVID-19 and restrictions here.</br></br>

I do not know anything about PrisonPandemic organization, and if any, they could help in this matter.
