So all of this in there. But there are guys that got exposed, that got tested positive that hasn't- it hasn't affected. So how do we advocate for these guys? There was a huge amount of people that were marching on San Quentin and I have photos on the phone that people have sent me, and big banner that said Incarcerated Lives Matter, which I think is very cool.</br></br>

You know, and just for us sitting in- in the quarantine with the guards going “Sorry, I got nothing to tell you.” “Well, when are we going back to our-” “Well, I got nothing to tell you. Just shut up and and hang loose. We'll figure it out.”</br></br>

Meanwhile, you know, but just knowing that those people were out there doing that. It was a big deal. We had a couple of guys who went on a hunger strike, to try to prove a point.</br></br>

And I'm talking 10 day hunger strike. But that's something that people need to know about. And anybody who chooses to say that this is a hoax, or this is not real: you know what? You got another thing coming.</br></br>
