UCI: What has the COVID-19 situation been like at your facility?</br></br>

Caller: It’s been pretty hectic. We’ve had two outbreaks with COVID, both brought in by deputy police officers. And through those times, we haven’t really been given cleaning supplies. We haven’t been properly quarantined.</br></br>

The last COVID outbreak we had was about two weeks ago, and a couple people tested positive, and they left the people in the module with us, but they just gave them a different free time. But it wasn’t properly protecting us because during food service, all our slots are open, we’re touching the same slots. Our free times are still in the same area. We just – it wasn’t separated or segmented, so we all – everybody ended up getting COVID.</br></br>

I got COVID and was having problems with my asthma. I was telling nurses that I felt like, at times, I couldn’t breathe. And they just was telling me, “Oh, it’s just the COVID. You should write to the doctor, maybe they can give you Ibudol” and different stuff like that.</br></br>

Like, we have a day where we do laundry exchange, and they’re still going into inmates’ cells and not changing their gloves. Knowing that we have a COVID outbreak, and going to everybody else’s cells and touching their bedding, their food, all their personal hygienes and stuff like that. So it's been pretty hectic here. We haven’t been properly protected, I feel like.</br></br>

UCI: How has the vaccination situation been like at your facility?</br></br>

Caller: I mean, they came in with vaccinations. But I had a problem with the vaccinations. I don’t know if it was kind of like a big problem.</br></br> 

I was kind of asking questions on the vaccinations, like what the different ones and what are in them and stuff like that. And I was only told about the Moderna vaccination, so I got the Moderna vaccination.</br></br>

I was never informed about any other ones. And then, after I got the vaccination, I had deputies coming up to me telling me, “Oh, you should never have got Moderna, you should have got Pfizer.” I was kind of like, “I asked all these questions like, is there any other ones, but they kept telling me it was only Moderna.”</br></br>

But they offered it to us. Some people got it, some people didn’t. Some people had to write to get it. It’s kind of been on and off.
