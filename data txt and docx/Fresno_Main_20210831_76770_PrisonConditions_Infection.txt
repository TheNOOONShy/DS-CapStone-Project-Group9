This story was told by a person incarcerated at Fresno County Jail.</br></br>

Caller: Well, yeah. I've been here in the Fresno County Jail. I've experienced the outbreak of the mumps and now, you know of course, the coronavirus pandemic.</br></br>

And I, you know, I read all the articles. I do get the paper, and I read the articles on how the sheriff is saying that she's doing this and she's doing that, you know, to protect us. And I've been on COVID-19 lockdown. I'm on lockdown, as we speak, as we're speaking right now, you know what I mean, and I think it's too late in the pandemic for us to be on lockdown.</br></br>
 
The jail should have a procedure in place to protect inmates like me, you know what I mean? Every time we get put on COVID lockdown, you know, our courts stop, we don't have no movement, nothing. You know what I mean? </br></br>

They, you know, they give us one free phone call to our family. You know, and they just started the visits to where one family member can come for an hour, you know, so I don't think that the sheriff's doing a good job because they - it's too late in the pandemic for us to keep getting re-exposed to the coronavirus. You know, COVID-19 was earlier, you know what I mean?</br></br> 

Yeah, in the beginning, you can expect, you know, to have to go through that because they have to get a handle on how to, you know, adjust to the pandemic, but a year or something later, you're still trying to adjust to the pandemic?
