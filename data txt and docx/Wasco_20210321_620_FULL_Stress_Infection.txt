Hello,</br></br>When this letter reaches you I hope it will find you in the best of health, well as for myself I’m blessed. Well I can tell you this pandemic is something I have never seen or heard of. And it’s scary living in prison in a time like this. Does not feel right because I think about my family a lot and hope they are well. But other than that I just put it in God's hands and keep praying.</br></br>I was sick for a moment with COVID but I’m OK now. I have not received the vaccination yet but I will soon. I will be glad when this is over but in the mean time I just try to stay safe in this prison. Well that’s about it for now and I hope everything go well for you in college and may God bless you.
