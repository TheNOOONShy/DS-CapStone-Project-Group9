This story was told by a person incarcerated at John Latorraca Correctional Center.</br></br>

UCI: And did you ever get COVID or know of anyone like in your facility that had COVID?</br></br>

Caller: Oh, yeah. Yeah. There's - there's - there's a lot of – when – right now, I'm in - right now, I'm in a dorm. Okay? But, six months ago, I was in the SHU. And I was in lockdown where it's individual cells. And people with COVID were – they would put in there.</br></br>

You know what I'm saying? And they would just put them in a single cell, by themselves. And they would put a red - a red sticker by their door. And you know that that's the people that had COVID. So like you had to keep your distance like if you went by there or something.</br></br>

But they still had their tray slots open. They still had to get - get food and everything like that. But they would - tehy would put them in their own cell. So I was – I had a lot of neighbors and stuff in - in administrative segregation that had - that had COVID.</br></br>

But I never got it in there. But here, here on the yard – right – where the dorms are at, they have a couple dorms that are set aside for quarantine. Right?</br></br>

And people do come in there, off the streets, with it. Yeah. And they get it. And then they have to start the quarantine process again.
