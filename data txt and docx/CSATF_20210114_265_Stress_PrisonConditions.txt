This letter was written by a person incarcerated at SATF (California Substance Abuse Treatment Facility and State Prison).</br></br>

But nevertheless he continued doing the same thing because that was his job and the officers did not want to do it. They do that so you get in trouble, they play with you sociologically. For a prisoner it is stressful and tiring to move on one bedroom to another since you do not know what kind of people you can encounter.</br></br> 

Since not all people like to do the program, they just want to get high, drink liquor, or get tattooed.</br></br>

It is mentally stressful since I have a life in prison and I only have one opportunity to go to Mexico and if I lose it I will not leave this prison. So I make the most of everything good and try not to get together with those people. For those of us who have life in prison, it is very sad because we do not have anyone who is not there.</br></br> 

We have to wash or iron clothes for other prisoners to earn money to be able to buy toothpaste, or shampoo, or beans, soaps, or rice.</br></br>

It is hard for us here. We have to teach ourselves to value the little we have and more in these times. Since I did not work for almost two months and they did not pay me in the kitchen. And as I tell you to be able to buy what I need for my personal cleaning is very difficult.</br></br>

And at this time they limit us to buying the maximum in the store for my purchases. It is sad but with the strength of God it is not impossible.</br></br>

Being here it is almost like living in the streets back home. If you have a store you are my friend. If you have nothing you are not anyone and it like they only approach you out of interest. And many times they want to use you for bad things. That is why I try to keep to myself.</br></br>

This is why in this quarantine I learned to value my freedom. Since I was locked up for more than a month and a half without being positive. And my exams continue to come out negative and I take the best possible care of myself.
