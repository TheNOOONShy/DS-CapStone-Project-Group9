This story was told by a person incarcerated at Soledad.</br> </br>Caller: I'm at a facility that is, the capacity that it should be if it was one man in a cell, it'd be about 1,400 people. We got like 2,000 people here right now. And they're talking about sending 500 people from DVI and then talking about sending guys from San Quentin.</br></br> 

So we would definitely be over capacity. So, in a prison, in a facility that's built for about 1,400 people, they're trying to put 2,800 here.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, that's not good.</br></br>

Caller: There's no visiting. There's no visiting at all. So you're basically getting mail, you get phone calls, because they have phones in the building, and they have phones on the yard. So you get access to the phone, but that's sporadic.</br></br>

UCI: Do you know how sporadic it is?</br></br>

Caller: Say that again?</br></br>

UCI: Do you know like how often you can use the phones?</br></br>

Caller: Oh, you can use the phone when you shower every three days. So, every 72 hours, they let you shower. And when you come out for a shower, they let out a small group of people. They don't let out more than 16 people at a time.</br></br>

Oh, to give you a logistical thing, the housing units, two of them hold 350, every other housing unit holds 250. And there's 10 housing units here, so we have eight housing units that hold 250, and two that hold 350. That's if they're double cells.</br></br>

UCI: So how have you been coping, like, emotionally and mentally, with everything that’s been going on?</br></br>

Caller: I’m a unique individual. I read, I read a lot. And I spend a lot of time reading. Oh, that's the other thing.</br></br> 

You can take college courses. They're doing like a distance learning thing where they give you the books, and then you know, they give you a workbook to work out of, and then you do the work, and then you send it in; they come and collect it. So that's still active.</br></br>

And then we have a couple of colleges, like down there by you. They have a DVD system where they have DVDs that you can watch and you can take courses on and then - but with Proposition 57, all the college programs are impacted because people can get time off.</br></br> 

So everyone's trying to take those. They're hard to get in. I was just a lucky guy.
