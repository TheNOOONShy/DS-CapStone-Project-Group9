This story was told by a person incarcerated at Santa Rita Jail.</br></br>

Caller: And this jail is just like very, they - they not really caring about how they - they pretend to be like, they care about people, health and stuff but they really don't. Another instance, when I was in four building, the sergeant that do the interviews as far as newspapers, for the news and stuff like that. He said that he, you know, he didn't find out, or his deputies didn't find out about the outbreak that happened in four building when it was a mass outbreak.</br></br>

I was in that building, the next pod over. They was very aware of that. I even asked one of the deputies, like you know, "Why would the sergeant say this, right, in the paper, right, when he was right there?" He tell me that's above his pay grade, so he just left it at that.</br></br>

I said, "But you know that's people's family," and stuff like that. So, he didn't really want to elaborate on it like that, he just pretty much left it there.</br></br> 

But, you know, I definitely let him know, you know, that like, that was like, you know, that's totally unfair to our families because this sergeant or whatever he is, is on TV or giving interviews to the paper saying he just found out about them. When he been knowing about this or the deputies been knew about this outbreak and tried to make it seem like they didn't find about it until sometime later.</br></br>

You know, so this jail is very un-functional. And, they don't use bleach, they use this disinfectant that's very watered down. You know, they don't have like [unintelligible] alcohol wipes for us, accessible for us.</br></br> 

They run out of it, like they don't keep enough of it, you know, in stock for us to be able to have it. They run out of it and stuff like that. Like, you know, they don't get the power workers, you know, the real cleaning supplies.</br></br> 

Even if they don't want to give it to the people that's ain't a power, just to come on and clean up with Clorox bleach and stuff that they get that's supposed use for the pod, at least to try to keep the COVID down. So those are my concerns as far as this jail during the pandemic and stuff like that.
