This story was told by a person incarcerated at High Desert.</br></br>

Hello PrisonPandemic,</br></br>

I was actually shocked to get a letter from you guys! It’s not a lot of organizations out there that reach in and wanna hear our stories day in and out during this pandemic in here. Being on the inside during this time has its ups as well as downs but we try to stay sane in everything we do. We are currently on quarantine at High Desert so all movement is at a halt.</br></br>

We’ve been like this for 5 months and a couple weeks now. My safety is always at risk not only by inmates but the staff also. Up here they make it seem like we brought this in here and clearly we are not the ones going home and going out everyday.</br></br>

To be honest, I haven’t had a visit from my family and loved ones since reaching High Desert. Due to the distance and my mother being sick, it can be a downer at times. I mean calling them is okay but being in their physical presence means more especially during this pandemic!</br></br>

I suffer from Bi-Polar Depression so everyday is a new day for me. I read, write, work-out in my cell, do homework, watch T.V., and most of all try to keep myself from going crazy! I know we are in prison and we are doing time but I’ve seen people go out and never come back. I don’t know if they lived or came back because they don’t tell us a lot here.</br></br>

I hope this gets put in the right hands to hear this and thank you for the opportunity.</br></br>

Take care.
