This story was told by a person incarcerated at Donovan.</br></br>

UCI: So how has the COVID situation been like at your facility?</br></br>

Caller: Right so first of all I want to thank you guys. I’ve received one of your letters sent by a college student, am I right? And I highlighted some of the questions which is something similar to what you just asked and first question here is, “What has it been like being inside during this time either at the beginning of the pandemic, middle, or now? How do you feel about your safety inside? What has it been like to have reduced visitation from family, loved ones? How have you been coping with this crisis? How have the vaccinations been going at your facility?”</br></br>
Right. And to share a little bit of my experience right, as far as the beginning, the middle, and now, this stage. In the beginning of the pandemic. It was- it was very difficult and uncertain and that was due to experience the family- my family, loved ones, and situations of those visits cause, as soon as they implemented the COVID around here, they shut everything down. We weren’t getting no contact visits, the program itself as far as payroll, phone calls, your yard time was limited as well.</br></br>

UCI: Ok ok, and so the reduced visitations and programming affected you a lot.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah no doubt, no doubt. I’ve been in- I’ve been in prison myself for 23 years right? But it was just crazy to see, you know the- you know the outside pandemic also take a major affect. Here, within the prison environment right.</br></br>

Another little note cause I- prepped a little bit of- of feedback here to share with you guys. Because they said it’s a research project and it’s feedback and all that, I’m privileged to be part of it. So a second thing I wrote here was initially there was a lot of fear and now because of the way things were being handled, right?</br></br>

Well we saw here and think you might- you probably heard this already from RJ Donovan inmates, the way they were isolating inmates that were coming out positive with COVID-19. They were throwing them all inside, you know being inside the gym facility. And people were mixing and all that, where ever you know they weren’t really being supervised, and thank God I never tested positive but you know, I was within proximity of that gym.</br></br>

And it was strict going down, right. It was coming around, building to building but thankfully by- by the time they got it under control, which was, let’s say like February of this year. They kind of slowed down the vaccinations and the ones coming in as well.
