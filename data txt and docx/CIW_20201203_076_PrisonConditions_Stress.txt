This letter was written by a person incarcerated at CIW (California Institution for Women).</br></br>

Twas the night before Christmas</br></br>
and all through the jail</br></br>
Not a creature was stirring</br></br>
not even a snail</br></br>
Some inmates were hanging</br></br>
by their necks in despair</br></br>
With hopes that soon</br></br>
they'd be free from there</br></br>
The prisoners were all</br></br>
crashed in their beds</br></br>
Except for the ones</br></br>
that rather be dead</br></br>
With living nightmares</br></br>
throbbing in their heads</br></br>
Come Dillonges with derringer</br></br>
and Nixon on Vixon</br></br>
Sitting here waiting</br></br>
on the final conviction</br></br>
With Christmas in jail</br></br>
there's not much to tell</br></br>
Lying in a coffin like cell</br></br>
wondering if next year,</br></br>
I'll be sentenced to hell
