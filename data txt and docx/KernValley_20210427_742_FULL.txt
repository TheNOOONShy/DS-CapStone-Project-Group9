Dear PrisonPandemic,</br></br>

Received your letter on Friday. Thank you so much for your concern and taking the time to write this lonely ol’ cat. It’s not everyday I get a letter from someone on the streets. As you know, my name is [redacted] but most people call me [redacted]. I am a 65 year youngster serving a 35 years to life sentence.</br></br>

Just so you know, I am not a weirdo. By that, I am not a rapist (chomo, child molester). I am here for kidnap robbery, just because I moved a person two feet away, against their will is where the kidnap charge came in.</br></br>

In November of 2019, I went out to court in Orange County. When I got back to prison, I got so sick and thought I was going to die, refusing medical. I just wanted it to be all over, that I would go to sleep and not wake up. How I wished that would had happen.</br></br> 

After all, who wants to die in prison? And who wants to spend the rest of their lives in prison.</br></br>

I’ve come to terms with myself, and have accepted the fact that prison is where I’ll die. But anyways, after the months of being so sick, I finally found out through lab work that I had come in contact with COVID. As I reflect back and look at all the beautiful folks that lost their lives really saddens me.</br></br>

It’s been crazy here in prison during this pandemic, so much has changed and wonder if we will ever get back to normalcy. Even though I had COVID, I still took the vaccine because I am at a higher risk than most people due to my age medical problems. Even when they come around asking if I wanna get tested, I never refuse. I’d rather be safe than sorry.</br></br>

Just last week they started contact visiting, and it sucks. I don’t get visits, but I hear it all the time, they get one hour contact on Saturdays and one half hour on video on Sundays. No food, two bottles of water and that’s it. I feel for those families who travel hundreds of miles only to give their love ones one hug at the beginning and one hug at the end.</br></br>  

That’s what they get for one hour. That breaks my heart.</br></br>

There’s so much more I would like to share with you, but I can’t put it down on paper because of retaliations towards me. Yeah, criminals in uniform look at George Floyd and that should tell you.</br></br>

It brings me great pleasure when I see people as yourself doing good for those who are less fortunate. That’s a great thing you’re doing. Keep up the good work and good things will happen to you in your life.</br></br>

Stay in school, complete your education and make your parents and those around you happy. I’m happy for you. As I look back on my life, I wish so much that I could start my life all over again. My case is still on appeal, like they say, “It's not over until the fat lady sings.”</br></br>

If you have any questions that I might be able to answer, don’t hesitate to write me. I’m not looking to pick up on anyone. It is nice to write someone every now and then. You can also reach me by email.</br></br> 

This prison allows us to get tablets, free, by a company called JPay. You can do that by downloading the JPay app. Fill out the information and put my CDCR # and name. It only takes a few minutes to get approved.</br></br>  

It’s much easier for me to correspond with you guys through my tablet. So until next time, stay safe and hope to hear from you.</br></br>

God bless.
