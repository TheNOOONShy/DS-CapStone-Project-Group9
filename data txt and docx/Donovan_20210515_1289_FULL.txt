Hello inquisitive, </br></br>


You hoped your message finds me in good health. For the most part it did. I am still an abled body that possesses a seasoned mind ripe ole age of 58 (well almost, 57 ½ ) . I feel the need to convey that your inquiry was, and is, a first. I am both elated that you picked my name, but, both saddened and disappointed with the veiled attempt of concern. </br></br>

After forty years or so in here, we get used to the inquiries that fein concern in order to hopefully get the crux of the real need- information. It’s ok, like Doc Holliday says in the movie, “I’ll be your huckleberry”.In the the face of the death I witnessed and made aware of by the prison grapevine, I become even more lonely and had to call up my deepest regimen of inner strength to fight off my number one demon- depression. It seemed as if this fella was knocking at my door daily. </br></br>


 I have never been more grateful for all the self-help tools I’ve learned of in the last decade while trying with herculean effort to dig my way out of a conditioned rutt of character defects. It the tools learned there in, and my innate need to re-connect back with humanity that not only made it possible to get through this pandemic, but, to also go further and explore on the idea of seeing the positive sides to the pandemic. </br></br>
        
It was, is, a struggle to see any positives of a virus that doesn’t know compassion, and has a need of surviving at the cost of its host.  It has also been scary knowing that my ole brothers in blue (inmates) and I are receiving medical care by staff that either don’t really care, or are pressured into not caring by the guards. There was a surge here, even at the very facility I am housed in, to where four to five men died. </br></br>


One of my friends told me at work on our break time that his cell partner died right in front of him. He actually watched him take his last breath. He has shared with me that he is still suffering mentally after four months time. This in turn has affected me. The ripple effect. The real tragedy is that thesemen in here do not know how to express themselves because of what their culture has taught them, suppression or aggression. </br></br>


I can see it with a trained clarity as I’ve been studying emotional intelligence and interpersonal intelligence for a number of years now. In 2016 a couple of friends and I designed and structured a workbook and group of emotional intelligence for the mental health dept. I have a couple of published articles online trying to spread the word about the silent epidemic that is taking place with the boys here in Western Cultures.  </br></br>
I remember a couple of months ago at work, waiting to be released, there were about ten of us, and I asked the question of “how come no one is talking about how they have been feeling or coping with the pandemic” Silence!! I then went specific to a couple of guys who did talk a little, but you could feel their shame. You could see easily that the shame is connected to a helplessness. Boys and men are in the business of fixing, and they could not fix the invisible beast before them. </br></br>


I kept my attention to helping others and my foundation of principles that I do my best to live by daily and staying informed about the science of it all. Science is all about truth, and in times of struggles we can do the best we are capable of when we manage our emotions properly and follow or obey rules and guidelines. I recently read that wisdom is only possible when we marry experience and intelligence and use the offspring to further ourselves and others. </br></br>


 In these kind of situations fear can be a back breaker, and the best possible answer to fear is preparation and believing in ourselves. At this point I think that I will close this up, us older guys need a full night’s rest. I am curious to know, will I receive any kind of further correspondence? Please take care and be safe, and I hope your endeavor producers the desired fruit.</br></br>


Sincerely & Genuinely, </br></br>


P.S. The loneliness felt during this pandmeic was not given its due in this letter. Astounding! Also- could you please send me any and all publications associated. I am an avid reader. </br></br>
