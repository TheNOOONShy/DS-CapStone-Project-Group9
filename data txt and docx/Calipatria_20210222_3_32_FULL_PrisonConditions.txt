This story was told by a person incarcerated at Calipatria.</br></br>

Caller: Hello? I’m calling from Calipatria State Prison, and I would just like to tell--tell you guys that in here with COVID, everything’s kind of crazy. And yeah, it’s kinda strange, we got no program, just like on lockdown all day. It’s frustrating. Um, yeah, that’s pretty much it.
