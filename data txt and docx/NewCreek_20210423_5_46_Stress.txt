This story was told by a person incarcerated at New Creek.</br></br>Caller: I’m at New Creek State Prison. For the last year, since this virus has hit the prison, it’s been hard on a lot of us here. Lately me and some other guys got the virus back to back to back. It really took a toll on me.</br></br>It made me a better person to see how life really is to me and other people, you know. I’m always helping people. I’m always taking care of people and all of the inmates in here. I’m just trying to stay happy.</br></br>You know, keep people positive, keep warning them about washing their hands, keep their stuff clean and stuff in here. Like the prison I’m at, we have microwaves and we have to keep that very clean each and every time we use it. We wipe it down and sanitize it. Same thing with the water faucet and these phones we use here.</br></br>But for the main thing, we had a big outbreak and we got over it here and we’re doing pretty good right now, you know. We had a thing about phase two where that we go in groups of like eight people, four times a week. </br></br>You know, we have little activities for adult contact. We keep social distance. We walk in a canteen now, instead of them bringing it to us. So things have been looking better for us, you know.</br></br>There’s a lot of guys here still, they still want to know about the virus, what’s going on about it, and different viruses coming out like Johnson & Johnson. So, what we’re doing is that we’ve been stuff from newsletters from prison office and we’ve been [unintelligible] and keeping it going on.</br></br>But other than that, it’s hard, it’s at bad times, but we’re still making the best of it, you know. Each and every day I thank my blessings. You know, I’m alive, I’m healthy. You know, when I got it, I kept with them for about two months, but after that, I got back on track.
