This story was told by a person incarcerated at Solano.</br></br>Caller: Well, you know, like I said, they're, they're trying to stay on top of the best they can but it's always one of those things that linger in the back of the mind just how much protection can you move forward to get something like this. And, uh, you know, there's been numerous instances of false positive cases, isolation of various buildings, and people are being sent to isolation.</br></br>
So, it's not that the administration here is not trying to stay on top of it the best they can. Uh. And, in terms of just feeling safe, I don't think nobody feels safe right now with COVID either they’re in prison or on the streets.
