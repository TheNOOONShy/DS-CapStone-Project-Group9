This story was told by a person incarcerated at Fire Camp.</br></br> 

Caller: Now, let's go back to their failure to put in place any logical COVID-19 exposure contamination containment protocols. Part of their containment protocol was to have the porters, who are inmates, that basically participate in slave labor, so they get out of their cells for additional time, they cut up a sheet, a CDCR issued sheet, they cut it up into three-inch strips, and they created a special barrier in a section of the C block where we were being housed for our quarantine.</br></br>

So, I'm a level one inmate, and I'm being held in a level three-yard, which is illegal, it's a violation of title 15 classification, but they were doing it out of convenience at the Sierra Conservation Center. They took this special CDCR sheet up, had the inmates do it, and that was the COVID barrier.</br></br> 

My question was, okay, so now that you're using this special CDCR issued sheet COVID-19 protection barrier, what about the recirculating air that we're all sharing with these men?</br></br>

If we're going to be inside of cell living, okay, and we're going to be in recirculating air conditions, why don't you have this whole entire block be a transpac block versus having us sitting here with other persons that have access to staff that are coming in and out who catch COVID?</br></br>

UCI: Absolutely.</br></br>

Caller: Because three people on the C block caught COVID while we're in quarantine. And I'm sitting there going, is the special CDCR issued sheet gonna prevent that COVID from coming in here? Furthermore, the porter who caught it was delivering our foods trays that were not disposable.
