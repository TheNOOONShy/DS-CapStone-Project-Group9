This story was told by a person incarcerated at Mule Creek.</br></br>

Caller: And then, so nothing really happened for a while, and then it just started to take off like wildfire. And then before you know it, there was no real, you know, we had like these little fabric masks that weren't what they call the K, the K 1290s or whatever.</br></br>

UCI: Uh-huh.</br></br>

Caller: You know, the masks, you know the ones I'm talking about?<br/></br>

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: So it's like, well, how much real protection is that if you're supposed to be giving out these other ones that have the real protection from it. So for a while there, we were just stuck with those. And then, you know, it probably, it's probably hidden our building. In one by one, we've just seen people drop off. First off, people are getting pissed off, because it was, it was stopping our program.</br></br>

You know, we're, we're getting visits or hopefully trying to get packages, we're hungry, we're starving, you know, they're feeding us. But a lot of us depend on our food that we buy from the store. So it stops store and it stopped packages, which where we really get our food from.</br></br>

So it just, it made us mad when somebody we thought would test they wouldn't test positive at first. But people would just, "Oh, you know, the hypochondriacs in here," like, "Oh yeah, we got it" and it's like, "Quit lying" or, you know, people would get mad, and they threaten them. And then you know, then things would move on, and then another scare and then another scare.</br></br>

And then finally it hit and people are like, "Oh, wow, this is real." And now you start getting, you know, worried is this stuff really as deadly as they say it is, you know? And ironically, the person I that moved into my cell where he just left, the guy was one of the first people to test for corona.</br></br>

And then I start getting scared. And, you know, "Hey, if you if youâ€™re coughing and sniffling, don't pretend like you don't got it. Don't let your pride get in your way. Take it serious, because if it's really that life threatening, you know, please, you know, try to try to take into consideration that, you know, I'm not the healthiest person so please, cover your mouth, put a mask on or whatever."</br></br>

And for a while there we did. But we ended up both getting it. And once we did, it wasn't really that bad. Wasn't as bad as they made it out to be.</br></br>

UCI: Oh, well, that's good that you didn't get it that bad.</br></br>

Caller: No, it was more like a, you know, like a sore throat and a runny nose and a little cough. But when we, when you did get it, it burnt your nostrils like like you're breathing fire.
