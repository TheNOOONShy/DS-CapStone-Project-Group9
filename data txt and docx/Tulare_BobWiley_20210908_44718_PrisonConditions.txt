This story was told by a person incarcerated at Tulare Bob Wiley Detention Center.</br></br>

Caller: Oh, the COVID-19, it gives us, of course, procedures. Like, I've been, like, in custody for, like, two years. In the first year I think I had a winning case, which I only had 10 counted of court dates for appearing every hearing, which it was – they denied me.</br></br>

So, for a whole year, I haven't been to court. So, two months ago, I went to court and I started - I did the right to be heard in court because it's already an unlawful sentence. So, I cannot be convicted, they have to discharge my case no matter what because that's the rule of law.</br></br>

So, tomorrow I have court, which they're not going to take me, which is [redacted] hearing which, by law, I have to be there. And they close the doors of the Supreme Court under my case.</br></br>

UCI: And how has the vaccination situation been like at your facility?</br></br>

Caller: Well, the COVID-19, it's kind of good, you know. Only the court procedures, that's the only thing that's holding people back too. Like, they're not taking people to court.</br></br>

UCI: Have you been able to access –</br></br>

Caller: They already passed, like, the government rule. The government rule of the COVID-19 was 15 court dates for appearing every hearing, which people don't even go to court.</br></br>

They don't say nothing at court, they don't even take them so they could be heard. And they way past more than 15 court dates. So, there's two of us in jail right now, which we haven't been in court. Appearing every hearing to test out the exam. By law, they have to dismiss the cases.</br></br>

UCI: And so, is it taking longer for the cases to, like, have a date and all?</br></br>

Caller: Yes, because the government, governor Newsom signed a form that, by law, in California, in the California pinnacle book it says, ten court dates for appearing every hearing. If it passes 10 court dates you get an OR. Or, if it sets or continues, it has to be a dismissal. And government Newsom set 15 court dates.</br></br>

UCI: Wow.</br></br>

Caller: That's it.</br></br>

Caller: And the Chief of Justice said 15 court dates. Which out of 10 accounted court dates they switched it to 15 accounted court dates.</br></br>

Caller: That's my issue right there.</br></br>

UCI: And is there anything else you would like to share?</br></br>

Caller: Tomorrow I have court and they're not going to take me for court.
