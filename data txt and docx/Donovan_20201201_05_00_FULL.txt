This story was told by a person incarcerated at Donovan.</br></br>Caller: I'm at Richard J. Donovan in San Diego, California.</br></br>UCI: Awesome. Okay. And then, so let's get into it. So tell me about your experience going through the pandemic at your facility.</br></br>Caller: Okay. Well, actually, I've been taking it very hard. Because, prior to COVID-19, I had a - well, I still have my job. But I'm not really going in like I used to. I work as a clerk in the education department. And I also tutor a lot of the students. And I was attending college in the evenings. And I was attending Playwrights, meditation class.</br></br>So, now, instead of going to all my programs, now, I'm just stuck in the dayroom with many other individuals that just scream all day across the tier so that I can't even do my college work. And there's barely any room to even exercise. So it's been very, very, very hard to adjust to the COVID-19 in this environment.</br></br>UCI: Wow. When did - or it sounds like you guys are locked in the cell most of the day. Am I getting that correct?</br></br>Caller: Well, here, at R. J. Donovan, I'm in a facility - it's a little different over here. I'm in an open dayroom with six-man cells. And we we're allowed to come out to the dayroom.</br></br>However, we're not really allowed to go out to the yard. Occasionally, they allow us. But, and then, again, it all depends on what's going on in California regarding the tier system. Right? As of right now, we're on the purple tier. So, now, we're also restricted from going outside and getting any type of physical activity. And we need that, you know, to relieve some of the stress that we're going through.</br></br>So, now, instead of me being out and doing positive things, now, I'm like stuck in the dayroom all day with other individuals - some of them that don't even care about their rehabilitation. You know? So it's been quite challenging to adjust. We need programs.</br></br>UCI: Are you - is your facility kind of just putting everyone in the dayroom altogether, regardless of capacity, and that's kind of replacing the exercise?</br></br>Would you think that's kind of what they're trying to do?</br></br>Caller: Well, there's a lot going on in the dayroom. We have six-man cells. And we come out to the dayroom so there's barely enough room for us to do what we want to do. For example, right now, I'm taking correspondence college courses.</br></br>It's kind of hard to concentrate with all the noise around me - people screaming across the tier - that I've actually done a lot worse on my college essays this semester because of that reason. I just - I'm at like a 45 percent capacity when it comes to concentration - that I receive some of my essays back - I'm like, "Oh, my God. I can't believe I wrote this." It's just I'm not used to writing in that level. I know I'm capable of doing more. But it's very, very difficult in this environment.</br></br>We're like hamsters. Right? Like in a hamster tank. Right? And there are some people that actually clean and some people that don't clean. The people that are supposed to be cleaning are not cleaning. Other people voluntarily clean. It's just very, very, very bad. I've really taken it hard.</br></br>UCI: What do you mean by "cleaning"? Do you have certain individuals that are assigned to clean or sanitize the dayroom that don't and so, then, other individuals feel as if they have to take over? Or do you - I mean do the COs or any staff do that?</br></br>Caller: That is exactly what is going on right here.</br></br>There are individuals that are assigned to those positions that just ain't doing their job. They just got a bad work ethic. So other people that are, basically, picking up the slack and doing it for them. You know? Me, personally, every time I eat in the dayroom, I actually clean. I clean after myself. And, unfortunately, not everybody does that here. You know? It's like there's grown men here. Yeah. Exactly.</br></br>UCI: Yeah. How many - have you guys had a lot of outbreaks of COVID-19 at your facility, or have you seen</br></br>Caller: Well</br></br> UCI: kind of - oh, go ahead.</br></br>Caller: Facility E - at Facility E, here, in R.J.D., we haven't actually had no outbreaks whatsoever at all. So the testing that they're doing for their officers and staff, actually, I guess, is working. And we haven't had no outbreaks. And that's been the positive thing about the yard here.</br></br>UCI: Absolutely. How often would they say that - do you know how often they're testing staff?</br></br>Caller: Well, they were doing it every two weeks. However, a new memo came out. And it said that they're going to be testing every week now.</br></br>UCI: That's very interesting.</br></br>So do you find that, in your section, that you have more, I would say, health-conscious or, you know, very aware individuals, comparative to, maybe, the other parts of the facility?</br></br>Caller: Well, I know there could be more done, regarding the cleaning. What it is, is certain individuals just don't pick up after themselves. They're not really washing their hands.</br></br>So but there's one individual that has actually stepped up and actually is going above and beyond and making sure that all the floors are sprayed and that everything gets cleaned around here. He's not even assigned to the position.</br></br>UCI: That's great. I mean, you know, definitely, I think, it's been helping, obviously, with your facility. You know? It's kind of very rare right now.</br></br>But, in regards to, you know, if you get visitations prior to the pandemic or have you seen, you know, how has that been handling, maybe, not being able to see family members or to have any visitation? Can you describe what that's been like?</br></br>Caller: Well, prior to COVID, I was getting visits like once a year, even though, my family lives, predominantly, about three hours away from here.</br></br>The rest of my family, they live in Las Vegas. So that's about a five-hour drive. So that was very difficult for them just to kind of set some time off of work to make it up here - I mean to make it down here from Las Vegas. I've been taking it fairly well. I do call home, just to check on my family.</br></br>But my parents, they do insist that I call more often. They want to make sure that I'm okay in here.</br></br>UCI: That makes sense. Have they given you - I mean have you thought about any like coping strategies because you're in the dayroom so often and it is affecting your schoolwork? Have you thought of anything - has the facility provided any alternatives?</br></br>Caller: No. I did have a study room over in the other section that we would go to to try to get away from the dayroom.</br></br>However, because of COVID-19, they don't want us in groups. So all the rooms are, actually, been shut down because of that. So what I do to cope, I do try to meditate. I also do exercise a lot. I'm really health-conscious. And I do watch what I eat. And I also exercise. And that helps me a lot just to cope with what's going on.</br></br>But, regarding my schoolwork, I'm still slacking. I'm not at full capacity like I'm used to. In my cell, where I live at, I live with five other individuals. And these individuals don't do nothing. And all they do is talk all day. They talk about a bunch of negative stuff. And I'm just like in the middle of this war zone. And I just Ðthat's why my knowledge has left. I just can't believe it. They're just like talking loud. I don't do my schoolwork in there. I have to come in the dayroom.</br></br>UCI: Right.</br></br>Caller: So</br></br>UCI: Have you</br></br> Caller: Yes?</br></br>UCI: Oh, no. I was going to say, have you felt like the programs you've been a part of, you know, schoolwork and other activities, have you felt those have been negatively impacted because of the pandemic? You know, if you had certain things before. Do you feel like those have been reduced now?</br></br>Caller: Well, there's no more volunteers allowed to come in here. So the college staff cannot come in here no more.</br></br>And, also, the other staff that run other groups - for example, I was in Playwrights, where you try to write plays. And they have actors come in and they play them out. They're like 10-minute plays. And that was a good program for us that have creative minds, in order to write plays. And, at the same time, it was - the program's set up to where like it helps to become a better person.</br></br>You engage in group activities. And, now that that has been taken away, I - it's been, actually, more difficult. I'm only going to work once a week, on Wednesdays. Because it's three blocks here. And 23 block goes on Mondays. Wednesdays will be</br></br>And Thursdays will be block 25. But we'll only go on at - because I work there as a clerk and a tutor.</br></br>So only six students at a time, wearing masks, social distancing, and a bit of cleaning. And that has been taken away as of right now because of the purple tier status - if you know what's going on in California right now.</br></br>UCI: Yeah. So you're down to once a week for work.</br></br>That must be quite the change in just the mindset of it. Did they provide any - is there any kind of schedule for how people go back to work, since it's only once a week? I mean, you know, kind of what are they doing to help?</br></br>Caller: No. Well, what they're doing to help the students where I work at, they're passing out homework. I'm actually the one that passes it out. And, every two weeks, I pick it up.
