This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Ironwood. </br></br>

At first, prison officials here at Ironwood were not providing N95 masks or enough cleaning supplies to disinfect the cells and dayroom. Since then, things have improved. All inmates and correctional officers alike are using N95 masks and are taking the necessary precautions to prevent COVID infections. On this Facility D, there hasn't been many infections, which is reassuring that everyone is doing their part to keep each other safe and healthy.</br></br> 

Even though, these are difficult and uncertain times I practice daily prayer and meditation, which helps me to deal with my feelings. I focus in the present and on what is important in the moment. This allows me to remain positive and to stay productive.</br></br> 

Furthermore, I continue with my rehabilitating efforts. I occupy my time with in-cell studies, writing letters to loved ones and friends, exercise, listen to uplifting music and conversing with my cellmate. We do get recreation time, so it's nice to jog around the track and get a lung full of fresh air. It definitely helps to release stress.</br></br>

This is my program, which has been helpful to dealing with the current crisis.
