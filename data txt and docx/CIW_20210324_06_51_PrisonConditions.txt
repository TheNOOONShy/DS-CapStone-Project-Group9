This story was told by a person incarcerated at CIW (California Institution for Women).</br></br> 

Caller: I think for the female population being incarcerated in the center of California, within the center of California, that we were originally given manmade face masks that they made out of the state issue, what we call state issue clothing, and it was originally made out of our oranges. We have something called oranges, which is like reception center, so it was basic cotton and polyester, and those are the original masks that we had since the beginning of March of last year until January of this year. Now when two- a doctor and a nurse came in and they were tested positive, within two days over 700 people tested positive, Okay?</br></br> 

UCI: Wow.</br></br> 

Caller: And that was based on us not having the proper protocol for procedure, protection, as far as preventive measures. Now, while the officers, yeah, while the officers are screaming six what is that? Six feet distancing, social distancing. They want to enforce that to send us back to our rooms and we weren't coming out for seven days at a time, nine days at a time and weâ€™re forced to live in there seven and eight deep.</br></br>  

Okay now today when, before we, before I contracted the virus I was begging for something called SaniGuard. I noticed that all the officers were using SaniGuard. So when I look at the difference between what they normally issue, which is Cellblock 64 versus the SaniGuard, I was able to see that the Cellblock 64 is a carcinogenic.</br></br> 

UCI: Oh wow.</br></br> 

Caller: Okay, so when we're spraying it in our rooms, and that's what they're using to clean it with, they're not doing it themselves. They're using SaniGuard, which is food grade, which means that we can inhale it and we won't die or anything or, you know, make situations worse or anything. So being that I'm a broncil-, I, what do they call it, bronchitis asthma? So that's the kind of asthma that I have.</br></br> 

So the whole time that I was 602'ing, which is our griefing system, I was being told by the supervisors of- we have housing staff. Second, third, and first watch, and then we have supervisors for those housing staff members. And it's from the housing staff is basic, which is like the floor people, the people that deal with this eight hours or eight hour shifts. Then we have their supervisor, which are the sergeants and lieutenants and then the captains and so on.</br></br> 

So on my, on this particular yard the sergeants were covering for their staff, for their subordinates, saying that they issue SaniGuard. All these different things, you know, that seem like that they were going by the book that they were enforcing this, they were enforcing that. They were saying that the signs were posted about social distancing here. Every time we walk out of our room to come out for anything there's more than one person there, and we're not six cubic feet away.</br></br> 

Our bedrooms are packed with more than six people. The rooms were created for four and I was here when it was created for four. So we're on the max capacity with eight people in a room. And you're gonna tell me that when we actually caught the COVID I was less than two feet away from the next person that had COVID.</br></br> 

UCI: Wow.</br></br> 

Caller: In the room that I was in, yes. In the room that I was in, there were people that were 14 days clear still living there with us when we came in.</br></br> 

Okay, so as far as everything happening. The food portions because staff had to feed us on paper trays and things like that. We were given one ounce of potatoes instead of the four standard ounces and on one particular, on one particular day I wrote it down and showed our AVS system, which is our camera system, that instead of the normal so many ounces of food I got like one ounce of everything.</br></br> 

UCI: Terrible.</br></br> 

Caller: So how do you keep your body up to standards when you can't be fed the right food.
