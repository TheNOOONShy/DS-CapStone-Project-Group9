This story was told by a person incarcerated at Chuckawalla.</br></br>

Caller: Oh, I mean I'm in Chuckawalla Valley State Prison.</br></br>UCI: Okay. And what is your current COVID-19 situation at your facility?</br></br>Caller: Like if I got the COVID-19? I had got it.</br></br>UCI: You've gotten COVID-19?</br></br>Caller: Yes. I got it in May.</br></br>UCI: And how is your facility dealing with the situation? Like are they doing anything to prevent you guys from getting it?</br></br>Caller: Actually, they're not really like doing nothing. They're more like mixing people from like other yards.</br></br>Like they're bringing people that were sick from the COVID to our ...</br></br>They were mixing us. And that's how I ended up catching it. And what they're doing, a lot of these correction officers are letting people from other buildings, they're allowing other inmates to come in our building.</br></br>And people end up catching it like that. And that's how I ended up catching it. There's a lot of correction officers that don't wear a mask. You know, they're telling other inmates to put on their mask, but they're the ones bringing it in. And they're not wearing their mask.</br></br>UCI: Yeah. And what is troubling our concerning to you about this situation?</br></br>Caller: Well, I don't think they're doing their job right. I don't think they're being like that professional. You know? Because it's like they don't really care about us. You know, so I think what they need to do is like plan out the program a little more. Not letting other inmates come into our building that don't even belong in this building. You know?</br></br>UCI: Right, yeah.</br></br>Caller: And for them to stop mixing people from other yards.</br></br>Like for them bringing other people from other yards over here to this yard. Because that's how they're getting other people sick. That's how I think everybody's getting sick because the numbers keep going higher and higher. And then it's costing more deaths. And they're not like really taking too many things too serious. Now they're like, like if it's a joke when it's not a joke.</br></br>UCI: Right, it's not.</br></br>And how was COVID-19 handled at your facility at the beginning of the outbreak? So, like how did they handle it in March in the beginning when we first started finding out all this information?</br></br>Caller: Well, like the beginning of March, they weren't really doing nothing. They didn't pass out like no masks, no nothing. They started passing out, they started giving us masks when people were getting sick already.</br></br>UCI: Got it.</br></br>Caller: That's when they were, yeah, that's when they started like, you know, supposedly like trying to take it serious. But they weren't really taking it too serious because they were still mixing the yards. They were still allowing other people from other yards to come to this yard. And like they were like moving people around. You know, when other, when the people they were moving over here, they were already sick. And that's how we all started getting sick.</br></br>So, they really didn't, you know, control nothing. They just didn't care. They didn't really know what they were really doing. They were just mixing people.</br></br>UCI: Right.</br></br>Caller: And that's how ...</br></br>UCI: What was that?</br></br>Caller: No, they just - and that's how a lot of people started getting sick. And that's how I ended catching it.</br></br>UCI: Yeah. Is it being handled differently nowadays, you think? Or do you think it's the same thing?</br></br>Caller: I think it's the same thing because they're still like - what they want to do right now, starting next week, what they want to do is they want to start sending people to work.</br></br>UCI: Oh, got it.</br></br>Caller: Sending people to it. People that are like in education. They want to start sending people to education. You know.</br></br>When some of these teachers, some of these food staff are now trying to come in. But they're still like forcing us like to go work and to go to education. And if we don't go, they're threatening us with write ups instead of giving us an option like you want to go or to work or you want ... Or like people that are in education, like give us an option to go to school or be able to work, and we'll do it in the building.</br></br>You know, but they're threatening us with write, they're threatening us with write up. And the majority of people are lifers. Like myself, I'm a lifer. So, say like if I had a job, or like if I was in education, they're going to threaten me with a write up. And that's like a denial for me, like a five-year denial for board. Like that would hold me back from not going home.</br></br>UCI: Got it.</br></br>Caller: And I think that that's kind of, and I think that's kind of messed up.</br></br>UCI: That is wrong, yeah.</br></br>Caller: You know, I don't think it's fair because it's like they're not worried about us. Like they don't even care if something really happens to us or we end up dying. Or something, you know.</br></br>UCI: Yeah.</br></br>Caller:	And I think it's wrong.</br></br>UCI: It is wrong, yeah. I agree. If possible, could you please tell us month by month how the situation has changed? But it seems like the situation hasn't changed much at your facility? Like just seems like it's the same thing, right?</br></br>Caller: Yeah.</br></br>UCI: Okay. So, what would make the, what do you think would make the situation at your facility better? Like what do you think that they should do?</br></br>Caller: What they should do, I think they should stop mixing the buildings. Like they, what they need to stop doing is letting other inmates from other buildings come inside our building.</br></br>Or like people that don't have jobs, they're just like volunteering to come outside and work. You know, what I think they should do is make these officers really take this serious and really wear their masks, because there're lieutenants in here that don't even wear a mask. And say like if you have a job, and if it's this building where I'm at, our workday is tomorrow, just let this building come out and work.</br></br>And as soon as we come in, bring them all in and let the other building come out. And for them to stay out there and let those buildings come out. Don't let nobody, no volunteers come out and work out there because it's all three buildings. All volunteers are coming out to together and they're all mixing them. And they're letting other buildings, other inmates from other buildings come inside our building. And I don't think it's fair because that person could be sick and get everybody sick.</br></br>What they need to do is time that up and not let nobody come in. If you don't belong in the building, don't come in. You know? Stay out there in your building. You know, and these officers, they're out there like in the yard without a mask talking to inmates. You know, without a mask. And then if we don't have a mask, they start yelling at us or they start threatening us like yeah, we're going to give you a write up if you don't have a mask.</br></br>But it's okay for them to not have a mask? I don't think it's okay because we're not the ones bringing in the sickness. It's them. They're the ones that ...</br></br>UCI: Exactly.</br></br>Caller: You know, so they're not taking too many things serious. They need to tying up a little more, you know.</br></br>UCI: Yeah, I agree.</br></br>Caller: That's what I think. You know, and these officers, they think it's kind of funny. They don't take things too, too serious. You know?</br></br>UCI: Yeah.</br></br>Caller: And it hurts too, you know, because I felt bad, you know, like it was hurting me, you know. All I did is thinking about my family, thinking about my daughter. Like thinking about what's going to happen to me. You know, I was in so much pain, I was getting fevers. I was getting the chills. My bones were hurting. And it really hurts man.</br></br>You know, it's an ugly feeling. I'm saying like I'll lay down and then like I'll call my family. I'll cry to my family. Like I don't know what's going to happen to me, you know, I just want to tell you guys I love you. Something happens or anything, you know.</br></br>UCI: Yeah.</br></br>Caller: And it's messed up.</br></br>UCI: It really is. It's not right.</br></br>Caller: You know, they're not taking this too serious. They think it's a joke. It's not a joke. People are dying left and right out there in the world while we're stuck in here.</br></br>You know, it's messed up.</br></br>UCI: Yeah. Like how has the situation at your facility affected your loved ones? Like did they take away visits from you?</br></br>Caller: They took our family visits. They took a lot of things from us. Like, you know, but the main thing is like our visits, you know. We can't see our families.</br></br>It's been, we're going almost like, almost a year, you know. Maybe January, February will be two years. It'll be a whole year without a visit. You know, without us seeing our family. You know, and they're not planning ...</br></br>Giving us a visit soon. So, you know, it kind of hurts a lot, you know?</br></br>UCI: Right. How do you think your loved ones feel about the situation?</br></br>Caller: I just want them to do something. It's going to hang up ...</br></br>UCI: Okay, I just want to say thank you so much for participating in the PrisonPandemic study, okay?</br></br>Caller: Thank you.</br></br>UCI: Wish you the best, thank you. Bye.</br></br>Caller: You know, for listening and everything. Yeah.</br></br>UCI: Thank you so much.</br></br>Caller: You take good care of yourself out there.</br></br>UCI: Okay, thank you. You too. Bye.</br></br>Caller: Okay. Thank you. Bye.
