This story was told by a person incarcerated at Chuckawalla.</br></br>
UCI: And how has the COVID-19 situation at your facility affected your loved ones?</br></br>

Caller: It really affected them. It hit them hard because, for four days, I was pretty much incoherent.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br> 

Caller: I just really couldn't get up, and they had no idea what was going on.</br></br>
 
UCI: Yeah.</br></br> 

Caller: They had no idea that I was even in the hospital when I was in the hospital until they finally got a hold of somebody here. I don't know exactly what happened.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br> 

Caller: But it really shook them up because they didn't really think nobody in my family has been affected, so they didn't really know how serious it was.</br></br>

UCI: I'm very sorry to hear that.</br></br>

Caller: It's okay. We're through it. It's not your fault.</br></br> 

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: It was one hell of a journey though.</br></br>

UCI: I'm glad you made it out and that you're healthy and good now. What has it been like for you to have reduced visitation and programming?</br></br>

Caller: It's been horrible. We've been completely cut off from the world.</br></br>
 
UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br> 

Caller: The only thing we have is these phone calls and letters and pictures.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: You see, not just me, but you see lots of people and their demeanors, and also because the programs and the rehabilitations have been shut down, you just see people kind of start to deteriorate into a negative state of mind.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br> 
 
Caller: We're just cut off from everything, and our loved ones really are what uphold us.</br></br>

UCI: Right.</br></br> 

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br> 
 
Caller: And visits that we get or even the face-to-face contact really gives that intimate bond.</br></br>

Caller: The loss of that really has an impact on our lives.</br></br> 

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: It's just that they have not created something sooner.</br></br>

UCI: So, how have you been coping with the crisis?</br></br>

Caller: Just dealing with the punches as they come. You know they, we're pretty much powerless except for certain remedies that are given. I just adapt and try to deal with it the best way I can. I take advantage of what they do give us.</br></br>

UCI: Okay. And we only have a minute left, so is there anything else you'd like to share about your experience?</br></br>

Caller: No. I just want to thank you and everyone there for taking the time to do what you're doing.
