UCI: Thank you for that, that's understandable. So, how has the vaccination situation been like at the facility? Like, have people been getting vaccinated or how are they distributing?</br></br>


Caller: People have been getting vaccinated and it's unfortunate, too, right? Because most people are utilizing the motivation of getting visits to get the vaccination. And why I say it's unfortunate is because, you know, when you look at the affects of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine per say as of recently then you have, you know, adverse effects, or symptoms, or responses to it, you know? People have as an alternate also, they've lost their lives because of the vaccine.</br></br>


Me, personally, I haven't taken it, yet. Not because I'm so much worried about or have great concern; and therefore, apprehensive due to the short term effects. But the long term effects, especially as an African American male, creates great, you know, opposition within me. I have some great concerns. So, as a population as a whole, people are taking it, but they're taking it-. And I think more so, they're taking it not for the purpose of really curtailing the-, any outbreaks, but for the most part, so then that the system will use a non-vaccination as a reason to deny you of other types of programming, you know?</br></br>


UCI: Mhm, okay.</br></br>


Caller: Yeah, and then watch this. And I'd like to say this: understanding how medication is big money, I would not be surprised if there's some type of financial kick back to CDCR as I am in California, right? Per quota as to the quotas met to be vaccinated, you know? If I'm making any sense with that.</br></br>


UCI: Mhm.</br></br>


Caller: And so, that's even more concern for me because are they really doing it for my well-being. If they were, they would have prevented the outbreak in the first place by being more aggressive in, you know, their employees and being providing PPE in the beginning of this whole thing, you know?
