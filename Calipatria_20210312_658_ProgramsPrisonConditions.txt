It's been bad since quarantine came.</br></br>

Since we have been on quarantine, things seem to get worse. First the visits stopped. One of the best things of being here is the way everybody's face would light up once they see you. Can go a long way with that alone.</br></br>

The second thing was the yard change. The only thing good that came from one full building at yard, other than our heath, was finding other people to help pass the time with.</br></br>

Shortly after that we were given mask to wear. Which made no sense given the situation. It was understandable until things got out of hand. With dayroom leaving our possession we had nothing.</br></br>

They kick us while we were down.</br></br>

It's bad we have nothing but a shower and phone call, but it's fuel to a fire when we get wrote up for not wearing a mask. The reader should be aware we are inmates being held against our will in these closed environments and all we wanna do is go home.</br></br>

With it being three months off your good credit date, the peace officer are issuing write ups for not wearing mask. So why weren't the correction officers wearing mask? We're technically already in quarantine while they infest us.</br></br>

If we are here rehabilitating, then why are we forced to take abrasive action to do so? To be heard? For peace officers and correctional officers to bring peace and correction?</br></br>

Why must we argue angrily, fuss, and have 602 wars for our correction and peace? If they were here for correction they wouldn't write us up for minor things like speaking to another cell while we come out for showers. They would correct us.</br></br>

We get write ups for napping a little too long at count time. Pushing our freedom from us a quarter year when all that was needed was a light tap on the cell door. We get write ups for delaying a peace officer from reading a memo posted on the wall while being out for a shower.</br></br>

If not now then when is the right time to read it? Phone calls? Officers be short on staff two buildings away and yet we get shorted on our phone calls that we only get every other day.</br></br>

With our block having all the staff needed how are we getting shorted? Who was that, that decided we should only get video visits once a month while our regular visits are every weekend?</br></br>

Does that person or people believe seeing your loved ones less during a time like this help us rehabilitate better?
