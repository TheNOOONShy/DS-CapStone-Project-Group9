Dear collector of histories,</br></br>

Thank you for your letter and time. I’m very happy with you to listen my history.</br></br> 

I work in the kitchen in the prison. I’m 62 years old. I want to tell you on December 2020 this prison increase the pandemic. I was negative, and my partner celly is positive. But the staff officers moved after two days. December 2020. I’m in a different building.</br></br> 

Now I’m sick and can you tell me what can I do? Now everyone has COVID. I don’t have visits or phone. It's contagious. Please I need your help. In two years, I will go to the parole (BPH) but they want me to take responsibility. True or not. No sense. I’m working hard on programs, kitchen, no payment, other activities. Inmates death ready.</br></br>
 
Thank you. God bless.</br></br>

Happy New Year and Christmas.</br></br>
