Hello my name is [redacted] currently incarcerated at Kern Valley State Prison. I received a letter from PrisonPandemic project referring as to our experience during this time of history. I’m doing well thank you. You may not know me personally so I would like to help you on that and maybe give you a slight of picture perfect as to who you are dealing with. I do have a Facebook and Myspace I would like you to check out. Again, I want to give you a chance to get to know me better concerning this project, my Facebook is [redacted] with the above name [redacted]. Name has been changed concerning probation and parole concerns. But it’s my full name which it would be [redacted] my Myspace is [redacted] just so you know who you are dealing with.</br></br>

Dear [redacted] I’m coming at you with modest on high and sincerity. I respect your project and hopefully I hear about you again. I’ve experienced so much till this day and have just about a lot to talk to you about this pandemic. When I heard about the great pandemic I was wondering and thinking about how it came upon. It felt so unreal, and I heard that it wasn’t real and so on. It’s been hard for some of us concerning right housing and right treatment and safety.</br></br>

At the beginning it wasn’t really so much, but soon as outside patients were bringing in the disease it really started affecting us. Like establishing right housing and so on. Safety inside was really a worried cause there’s so much you can do. Reducing of family visits or loved ones has been hard for some of us. But we all try to work as one and hope the day goes good with a positive outcome. I’ve been coping with this crisis with a lot of prayer. I’ve been a victim of COVID-19 I believe twice already.</br></br>

First, thank God I made it without symptoms. The second one I would like to share a story with you. It started like this… I was laying down in my bed and I felt deep chest pains, so I got up and checked COVID-19 symptoms and chest pains fell in the category. So, my chest pains were getting really heavy and hard to bear so I started praying and sure enough my chest pains went away. Crazy Huh.</br></br>

About the vaccinations it’s been working well. The staff,nurses, etc. are really attentive to your care. Hopefully my story helps, hope to hear from you again, Bye.
