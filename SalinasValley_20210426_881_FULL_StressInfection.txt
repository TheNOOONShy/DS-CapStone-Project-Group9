Dear PrisonPandemic,</br></br>

I been received your letter. Thank you for the offer to the inmates if someone want to write you, or share some words about the COVID-19. Everything here was well, but a year ago, the TV news start to give information of such viruses. The COVID-19 that was spreading in all the world around very quickly, and that have been killing many peoples.</br></br>

It is not easy for no one inmates here. We are spending time almost lock up like very short, or the program of recreational yard. No, everything is change. Peoples have to accustom to use sanitations, to keep safety, the social distance, and wear masks with all of the struggle to surviving to avoid the COVID-19.</br></br>

The good thing is, the vaccination of shorts at the medicine is very good. I wish all people in the world around would have their shots. I think all inmates already by vaccine.</br></br>

In November last year one day, the cell doors opened, here were many doctors doing COVID test to all inmates through the nose with cottons. My test was negative result, but next month doctors come to the buildings again, doing test to every inmates and my second test.</br></br>

They talk my that I was positive result, and they placing my to other yard in other building to quarantine, and some other inmates too were placing too. During two weeks, doctors was checking my blood pressure and my temperature until I was clean from COVID symptoms.</br></br>

I was feeling like lost, no hope and depress, but the good thing is the vaccine. And I got already my two shots of medicine, and I now feeling in a good health. And I’m thank for that and thank to God.</br></br>

I not know you too, but I just want to write, respond a little. I do effort looking words in the dictionary. I wish the vaccine shots don’t miss for peoples in all the world around, and the pandemic will end don’t worry about inmates. I think for now we are feeling safety with the vaccine.</br></br>

Sincerely.
