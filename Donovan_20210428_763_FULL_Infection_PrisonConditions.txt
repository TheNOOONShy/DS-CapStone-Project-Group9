Dear PrisonPandemic,</br></br>

Hello I am here at Donovan State Prison. And you engulfed some hidden sources I can splurge to you all at Sunland, California.</br></br>

Well with the COVID-19 outbreak since March of 2020 here at Donovan Prison has been quite tough. We mostly all got vaccinated predominantly since then. We’ve been nicely authorized to wear face masks due to COVID.</br></br>

Eating our three regular meals have been prepared on food trays and brought to us inside steel to keep preserved for breakfast and dinner. We eat our prepared meals in our dorm and they take the trays back to the chow hall by workers to disassemble and clean.</br></br>

As for people’s visitors have been unauthorized due to COVID and being on phase one. We get free phone calls to call whomever for fifteen minutes.</br></br>

For recreation, we can only go out to do simple workouts, as: run, calisthenics, or walk around. No basketball or baseball playing, only handball. We would go out with only our building. There are three buildings per yard. Since March of 2021 only half of our buildings with only half of another building.</br></br>

CO staff, Psyches and other physicians must wear masks at all times. Also no outbreaks, just minor COVID-19 candidates, whom would be put on quarantine and placed in a facility in Donovan prison for help.</br></br>

Other than that, the staff really worked hard to keep all protocols under wraps. They did a miraculous job in keeping us safe. I’m astonished how good they have really worked hard to keep COVID-19 away from inmates.</br></br>

Well I hope my time inspired you to know more on the outcome of things in Donovan Prison.</br></br>

Have a good day and god bless you and hope you all stay safe also.</br></br>

Your fellow inmate,</br></br>

PS Write back if you’d like, correspondence is always nice. Here is also a card I drew you, hope you got a smile.
