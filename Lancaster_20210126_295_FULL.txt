UCI student, PrisonPandemic,</br></br>Truthfully, honestly, I do appreciate you taking the time and reaching out. During this pandemic I have been through a lot, being that I did catch the COVID and they had those who caught the COVID caged behind glass for a 14-day time period, longer if needed. They stopped all our communication with the groups we needed to better ourselves.</br></br>

They took our visits. They say they are trying to keep us away from the COVID but still today their staff are still bringing it in. Before they say they were testing them, I can't see it. Now here. Today we are back on modified program because of the coronavirus.</br></br>
 Crazy part is last week I was in the hospital and there were CO working who still had the virus. I overheard them saying they were positive but were allowed to work on the hospital calls. So these staff can still work passing the virus around and not care. We have lost a bunch of inmates here so far, I believe, and eight have died. Why? Because we aren’t safe.</br></br>
 Myself, I am an ex-gang member who wants only to pay my debt to the world and get home to my kids whom I love very much. I really want to show the world that I can be a better person. Just hope this place gives me the chance.</br></br> 

Anyways, I do draw, so what kind of art are you looking for? Do you guys have a penpal program? What is your program? I don’t mind to write ,just have to be really mind on what or who it is I’m writing to. Do you guys have monthly newsletters, or newspapers? What does your program offer? Most of all, how did you achieve my name?</br></br>

Don’t get me wrong, I will answer all your questions. And from what I can see I am very much appreciated to your concern on our well being. So, yeah, well, thank you for your love.</br></br>

Oh yeah, what does your firm help with such as legal help, art patterns? Please let me know. Anyways thank you for everything.</br></br>OK thanks.</br></br>P.S. Sorry to say my answers to your questions may be weird because I’m not into or haven’t been into writing for a long time. Just thought it wasn’t worth it and closed myself from outside and only focused on the inside where I live.
