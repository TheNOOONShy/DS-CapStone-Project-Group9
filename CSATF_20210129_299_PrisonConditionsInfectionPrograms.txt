This letter was written by a person incarcerated at SATF (California Substance Abuse Treatment Facility and State Prison).</br></br>

Next came a deeper modification, only 25 cells at a time were allowed to come out at a time. 25 percent of the building for phones and showers. Then came the day where one of our kitchen workers on yard supposedly went to a doctor’s appointment at an outside hospital, and was put on quarantine. And tested positive upon his return to the prison, this was in August.</br></br>

He tested positive which in turn caused the staff to quarantine all of the kitchen workers on his shift in attempts of containing it. Then the other shift in the kitchen was also quarantined. Then began the testing of the entire yard.</br></br>

About 40 positives out of 1,000, while at the same time the other yards were getting tested and also resulted in multiple positives. We were immediately put on lockdown. One entire building on our yard (our yard contains five buildings with 200 men in each) was emptied and made into a COVID hotspot for the entire prison.</br></br>

It quickly filled, then another building was emptied and also filled with COVID patients, some had symptoms, some had minor symptoms, some showed none.</br></br>

I personally was on a quest not to catch it. I wore my mask diligently, kept them washed, washed my hands, socially distanced, and as we were put on a regimen of weekly testing. No yard, no dayroom, canteen and morning and evening meals were brought to our cell doors.</br></br>

Those who took medication had it brought to them. People still kept testing positive, more and more each week.</br></br>

It ravished our building, and every week we stood at our doors on test result days to see who was next. It was like the TV show “Big Brother” and nobody knew when it would be their turn to pack up their property and be moved out of the building. Many had been living in the same cell for years.</br></br>

By November, half of our building had been emptied and refilled. We were given a chemical solution that we were to use on our sinks, doors, phones, etc.
