This letter was written by a person incarcerated at High Desert.</br></br>

February 17th, 2021</br></br>Hello PrisonPandemic,</br></br>I have received your letter. I really appreciate it. And I hope this letter will find you in good health as well. The difficult times have made me a stronger man. I would like to thank you for the uplifting encouragement that you sent me as I face my current incarceration. However, I do not know you, so how is it that you know people are thinking about me?</br></br>My experiences with the COVID-19 pandemic here at High Desert State Prison-B Facility have been uncomfortable. The reason I share this with you, is because I have two children age 10 and 6 of my own out there, and it is scary, because at times I think I may catch it and not make it out alive.</br></br> 

IÕm having a hard time coping with the crisis because of all of this movement/transfers throughout the CDCR and High Desert State Prison. This is all new for me, as it is my first time in prison. During this crisis, I isolate myself from a lot of people to keep myself in the best physical health. As far as reduced visiting, it is not the same being that I have to see my family and friends on screen and not in person.</br></br>For now, this is all I would like to share and I would like to thank you for reaching out to me. I really appreciate it. I also have a positive celly who in the future would like to share his stories regarding COVID-19 in the prison system. I hope to hear from you or your team at UCI in the near future.</br></br> 
Sincerely yours,</br></br>Take care, and be safe during this COVID-19 pandemic!</br></br>
