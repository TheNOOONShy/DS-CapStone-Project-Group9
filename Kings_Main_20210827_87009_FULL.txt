This story was told by a person incarcerated at Kings County Jail.</br></br>

UCI: Okay. That's great. Yeah. You can go ahead, please.</br></br>

Caller:	Okay. Here in Kings County area, okay? And it's -- this jail is very small, but I've been in jails from 2008, 2021. I've also been at Dix Brooks. In the area right here, they limit you on the programming.</br></br>

They limit you on the programming that they're supposed to provide. They choose who they want, that can program because of your past and your past programs.</br></br>

And so, the Courts, they do a lot of -- they -- people are locked up in jail or in prison. And while you're sitting there in jail and prison, there's some people that -- Well, you know, when you sitting in that jail and -- sitting -- I've developed a [unintelligible] habit and I sit in that cell, hour after hour and while in there [unintelligible] -- I'm outside or --</br></br>

And I'm daydreaming. I'm dreaming and I'm looking at people around me. I'm looking at the people at the wings that work in the facility.</br></br> 

So I can't -- [unintelligible]. And I can't, not something that -- And I can't --</br></br>

UCI: I'm sorry. Just one second. Would you repeat --</br></br>

Caller:	Huh?</br></br>

UCI: Would you repeat a bit? Because I'm getting a little unstable here.</br></br>

Caller:	Yeah, what?</br></br>

UCI: Do you mind repeating yourself? I'm getting a little unstable here, my Internet, my connection.</br></br>

Caller:	Okay. As -- when you're sitting here in the jail, some people can develop lapses. And they don't have the necessary mental health or the right type of facilities to get you the help that you need.</br></br>

As me, personally, in my story, as I sit here handling -- hearing -- As I sit in it, I sit here, all the women that pass by and I'm just like "Woah". It's like she just -- And I look at -- I still have a picture of my mom.</br></br> 

I sit there, and all I can do daydream all day long.</br></br>

UCI: Hello?</br></br>

Caller:	I'm literally playing a [unintelligible] -- how that is because that percentage is all that a person, you know? And you're in and you're out [unintelligible] and you've been -- sitting in jail. So, now when you come -- Now when you step out into the real world, you get a release date, except now you're stuck.</br></br>

You're some -- woman and -- without -- parole, it's ridiculous and I actually told this to a person -- communicate with society, they didn't have any type of program, any time of health -- for everyone for equal treatment. And they're saying that I have -- I've never had a cellphone.</br></br>

I've never had my -- I've never had a utility bill with my name on it. I've never had my own place. I've never had a car, or I've never had a job. And [unintelligible].</br></br>

UCI: Okay.</br></br>

Caller:	And a person -- to provide opportunities for everyone to get help and a program and sending people out to other cities, think that offer a lot of variety of help. And I hope to push any, not just certain individuals, and to act it on me from getting the help that I need.</br></br>

If you guys have somebody - people have somebody who -- who has somebody with a gun charge, with a gun, and you'll have somebody, like, that has a [unintelligible] and told me, ma'am, told me the drug program -- first program I will be referred to because of my past because I have a past record of addiction.</br></br>

And I feel it's not fair all because this program will not accept me locally. But that program will accept him locally, but my past are getting me -- get me into that program. And when I get [unintelligible] locally. That's their job, to help us.</br></br>

The program [unintelligible]. And, ma'am, I think what -- south 18, south 21, you know? And you're telling me -- I've been in and out of here a whole lot. I've been after prison still, and they've never given me a good program.</br></br>

And I go out because with no probation -- I have skills that I've learned. I've been to -- I graduated high school, and I've also been in a support group for a period of time up in South [unintelligible]. And now it's just, I feel like, during the pandemic when I was out there more recently, I went out to Kernel Hills to seek help. I had a drug problem.</br></br>

And, you know, something that my mother told me that made me feel really good, she said -- I said, "Well, Mom, I can't get no help. I'm trying to go to church, I'm trying to do things that I can do, but it's like everything is closed. And when I go to church, it feels like I'm not supposed to be there."</br></br>

She said, "That's the Devil. That's the Devil making you feel like you're not supposed to be supposed to be there." When you're high and you're asking for help, that's when you're supposed to ask for help. When you [unintelligible].</br></br>

And so, most of the -- I have a hard time with doing things. I have a hard time -- I do have certain health issues. And it's harder for me to do certain things because certain things I've never experienced or certain things I've never done.</br></br>

And so, by the fifth time I was out for program going on program. I have mental health. And I put a phone call [Unintelligible]. And I don't have a cell phone, but they're treatment groups that I -- and I'm like, "Well, what do I do?"</br></br>

I'm going [unintelligible]. Help with business, paid for health. I'm twenty, and I said "It's time to get help". I'm knocking on strangers' doors, cause I'm -- I just don't know.</br></br>

And I actually called the police on myself. I actually called the Sheriff's Office, you know, in trying to get help, in trying to get somebody to arrest me, trying to get somebody to help me.</br></br>

I'm instead getting, "Fight it out. Fight it out. Fight it out. Fight it out," when I needed help. I'm [unintelligible] sick, you know? I needed somebody to get me into a program.</br></br>

I'm on parole. So, I asked my parole officer for assistance. I asked her for a program. For my health. Okay. [Unintelligible] out there and [unintelligible] out there, knowing that I needed help, no one's going to help.</br></br>

And they're asking me for it [unintelligible]. But it seems like, to -- go to an event. I like what was -- it's just -- there's a lot that were lost during the pandemic, and my heart goes out to the families. My heart goes out to those people, ma'am, you know?</br></br>

UCI: Mhm.</br></br>

Caller:	But at the same -- and on another note, no one -- how they opened up more doors, where lots of the other cells -- It opened up for [unintelligible]. It opened up a lot of opportunities for kids, providing a range of different people, you know? You've got different [unintelligible] on most things.</br></br>

But, ma'am, during this time, I've never received any stimulus check, you know? I'm still waiting. I'm trying to get assistance, in getting a stimulus check, trying to get money you know?</br></br> 

And that's the thing -- those are the things that I have a hard time with, you know? I don't even know how to fill out one of those forms. I'm trying to ask for help because the people that don't know how to fill out those forms.</br></br> 

They don't have nobody providing help or assistance to help a person to fill out forms, you know, go for things that they think they qualify for, because they can get their checks in here, because they do give you checks.</br></br>

They deliver checks here, you know? So, I don't have nobody offering to helping me with filling out the form. They should have somebody who's working here.</br></br>

They should be giving vaccine shots. They should be offering them. You have people -- because this jail right here's very small. You have people on the day room floor. And that's overcrowding because you've got an epidemic going.</br></br>

Why do you have it crowded? Yeah. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten people on -- welcome out here on the day room, including they come out of the cells. So, you're overcrowding people.</br></br>

If this pandemic's still going, on and it feels like you're supposed to have masks, supposed to act like your distanced, and because it's -- because people don't come here and look and see what's going on. People don't know.</br></br>

People don't know because they don't see us locked down. And it's not really known. It's kind of under the radar.</br></br> 
But a person could come here and make people admit that they're not the right way. A person would see that things are going are going on that shouldn't happen.</br></br>

That's actually -- technically, it's wrong of people to have people out here on a day room bunk. You know, it [unintelligible] finally releasing people because they're overcrowding people in jail. It's overcrowded.</br></br>

If you're sick in here, you can't get the proper medical attention in here because they don't have the -- they don't have the -- this facility right here doesn't offer the proper health care nor -- nor mental health care that we need.</br></br>

You have 600 to 700 inmates, yeah, 600 to 700 inmates that are in this facility, men and women. And you do not -- you have two mental health workers, and one of them is the head doctor. She hardly -- she doesn't see anyone.</br></br>

It's only the male doctor that sees anybody. His name is [redacted]. Oh, I'm sorry. So, he sits there, and he's like the only one that sees people.</br></br> 

But you've got 600 to 700 people you've got to see, and you've only got two people, or one person, throughout the whole week? And only one mental health person is throughout the weekend that's on call. And they're only seeing a handful of people.</br></br>

Out of -- he's seeing ten or 12 people. And it's 600 to 700 people here at the jail.</br></br>

And instead of you keeping people here for nonviolent offences, misdemeanors. You know, bails are low at $5,000, $10,000. They could have the whole [unintelligible] instead of fighting them out, you know?</br></br>

They should give them that. It's like, having the pandemic going on, give a person a chance to live. Give a person a chance at life. Give a [unintelligible].</br></br>

That's why I ask, how come I, you know? I -- [unintelligible]. I don't know. I'm taking the steps.</br></br>

I'm taking the steps to reach out to different institutions or different - for programs. I'm taking the --  I'm reaching out. I want to get better for myself, better for my life, ma'am.</br></br>

Only [unintelligible], you know? And all my life, I'm asking someone to feel sorry for me. That's a simple, but I'm asking for a chance, opportunity, as I said.</br></br>

And a program would give me and help me in introducing me back to human contact, having a proper relationship, help me relationship, at the same time working, honing in on the skills that I have acquired throughout the years but also giving me some vocational training and learning new skills.</br></br>

A program helps you a lot and I want to actually be at a learning program and giving me, and learning these tools. That way, I can things out there to the community once I get out of the program. That could help me in bettering -- in bettering my life and myself and what I'm trying to do with my life.</br></br>

I want to work in sales -- I would like to work in sales. And from sales, I would like to have my, open my own company one day. And I hope that there's time to [unintelligible] to this world, to the community in a productive way.</br></br>

I have children out there that I want to take care of. I want to be a good husband one day, you know? And I want to have myself surrounded.</br></br>

I want to get the help that I need to be capable. So that's just, I guess do we want to stop right now?</br></br>

UCI: I think you have one minute left.</br></br>

Caller:	Yes, ma'am.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller:	But, there's so much more that I would like to share.</br></br>

UCI: You can call back. You can end this one, and you can call back. Is that okay?</br></br>

Caller:	Yeah. I can't call back tonight, but you know what? You guys are closed Saturday and Sunday. So, I'll call back Monday. Monday, I'll call back and just -- I'll call back Monday, so look out for that call.</br></br>

UCI: Do you want to just call back now?</br></br>

Caller:	I can't because it's -- we're gonna be locking down.</br></br>

UCI: Okay. Okay.</br></br>

Caller:	So, time out here.</br></br>

UCI: Sorry about that. Oh. I really appreciate that you sent letters and you share your stories. I think finding help is really good, but maybe the situation doesn't support your idea. But keep trying, okay?</br></br>

Caller:	Yeah.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, I'm.
