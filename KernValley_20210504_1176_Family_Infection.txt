Hello my name is [redacted] currently incarcerated at Kern Valley State Prison. I received a letter from PrisonPandemic project referring as to our experience during this time of history. I’m doing well thank you. You may not know me personally so I would like to help you on that and maybe give you a slight of picture perfect as to who you are dealing with. </br></br>

Reducing of family visits or loved ones has been hard for some of us. But we all try to work as one and hope the day goes good with a positive outcome. I’ve been coping with this crisis with a lot of prayer. I’ve been a victim of COVID-19 I believe twice already.
