This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Theo Lacy.April 15, 2021</br></br>PrisonPandemic,</br></br>First and foremost, I hope this letter finds you in the best of health and stress free. As for me, I’ve been ok for the most part, but we all have our problems and we try to deal with them in our own pace. And sure, I don’t mind telling you my experience thru the pandemic.</br></br>I was incarcerated before it even stared. When I first seen it on the news, I didn’t think much of it. I honestly thought it was just something that was going to come and go. Our first change in program was the visit we were not allowed.</br></br>Visit’s which was pretty bad because a lot of people here are sentenced to jail and waiting for transfer to prison with more than 15 years to serve. It only takes two weeks for transfer a lot of people left to prison without seeing their family for the last time for a long time.</br></br>It got pretty bad later on the year. One thing I didn’t like was the fact that when I tested positive for COVID-19.. I thought I would see a doctor or nurse but all I got was the deputy telling me in the speaker that’s in my cell. That I have COVID me & my celly and to just ride it out you will be ok…?</br></br>Not one nurse came and seen me or check my vitals. And as for the food we have been reduced to cold meals & same thing lunch & dinner. For one I can’t eat those sack lunches because it makes me feel sick. And since I don’t have $ for food items in store I’m reduced to eating fruit every day.</br></br>And as far as the vaccinations they gave it to older people before us young adults. Being in jail in this state of emergency is not the best time to be here. I miss my family, my kids which I love with all my heart and hope I get to see before I go up state. # Bring visit back to normal.</br></br>Please respond I would like to know more about all this.
