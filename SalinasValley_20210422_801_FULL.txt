To whom it may concern,</br></br>

I received a letter from one of your students, but your name was on the return address so I guess this will go to you PrisonPandemic. Before I go on, let me extend the same courtesy that you did. I hope all is best as can be expected and these few words find you and those around you in the very best of health. What can I really say or where to begin, so I will give you a quick introduction of myself so you know and understand the person/man on the other end of pen and paper.</br></br>

First off, I did not know you could find incarcerated people on a public list, you learn something new every day. So I am guessing you know my crime as well as my sentence, but you, like others in today’s society, do not know me. Where I come from and/or the things I have been through. I understand you want to know about the pandemic in prison, but you first need to understand prison and its living conditions before the pandemic.</br></br>

I have been in prison since 1996/1997, I was 20 years old and I am now going to be 46. I was convicted of murder/robbery, first time in prison. I am a son, brother, uncle, father and now a grandfather, but most importantly a human being. Which I think we’d all agree on.</br></br>

So getting to a bit about inside these walls and growing up in here. I mean, there’s so much people of society don’t know about in here unless they have a family member who’s incarcerated. And even then, those of us in here can tell our loved ones about the abuse, living and medical conditions, retaliations, disrespect, and dehumanization we live with on a daily basis. At the end of the day it is like my family telling me of their struggles the last 25 years.</br></br>

I only have an understanding because of what they tell me, but I really have no idea because I have not been there nor have they been in here, and believe me when I say they are two very different worlds. I came in young as I said earlier, but in a place where there is constant violence, concrete and steel, you get old and sick (mentally and physically) quick and unseen like the wind in a way.</br></br>

This is an ongoing pandemic (prison or CDCR) and the human cattle that live within these walls. To your COVID questions though, because I could write you a story about being incarcerated and the “going ons” inside here, but that’s for another time and I am sure you are busy. Apologies for dragging on, but every story needs some kind of context. Well you asked how it has been from the beginning, middle, and now during the pandemic?</br></br>

At first it was like “oh the CDCR is just looking not to run programs” (an excuse basically), but then they started shutting down programs, jobs and then visits. And we (the population) knew it was real when everything was on the news about COVID-19 and the world coming to a stop. So for some it got hard, but for others in the beginning if you were a “critical worker” or as you all know them, essential workers, you were the only ones allowed to move around the institution.</br></br>

Then staff or COs starting getting infected, not knowing they come in and before you knew it everyone was getting it, scary no doubt. Being that a lot of inmates have health/mental issues beforehand, throw in something like COVID-19 and our risk goes up 10-fold. They were keeping a list of people who tested positive with the rest of the population who tested negative, and no one knew until it was too late.</br></br>

By this time (December 2020/January 2021), well into the pandemic, they decided to make or turn one of the buildings into a “COVID-19 building” for those who test positive. By then a lot of us had symptoms, some light or beginning stages and some ended up in the hospital. Myself and my cellmate tested negative constantly.</br></br>

The constant tests were one, due to me being a “critical worker” and though, the medical staff was not recording who or when they tested inmates, so a lot of us were tested over five times, and finally our test came back positive (myself and cellmate). It was scary, but what can you do in here and we were thankful that our symptoms were light, we were quarantined for two weeks and put back in the same building we came from.</br></br>

I think once you’ve done a lot of isolation, or cell time, as we call it, or lockdowns with no visits for a long period of time, something like this you are prepared for, and at the end of the day what can you do about things beyond your control. Does it frustrate, anger and at times gets you depressed more than usual, sure, but there is nothing you can do about it.</br></br>

They ran phone calls and we got our emails, but there’s nothing, I mean nothing, like a hug and kiss, or a good laugh and conversation in person to say you are loved and cared about. Everyone deals with things differently and this is just my words and feelings about this whole mess.</br></br>

I received my first shot (Moderna) on the 24th of March, 2021 and as I was writing this I received my second one, and I made sure to ask questions and if it was the same as the first and it was (Moderna). They have barely started these shots though I’ve yet to hear anything bad about them, but we’ll see haha.</br></br>

Last but definitely not least, you asked about safety inside. And although I know you mean about COVID-19 and the shots, I will leave you with this, there is no such thing as safety inside prison. You have to be strong mentally and physically to be incarcerated, and sometimes the resources are so limited, the art of survival becomes you only resource.</br></br>

I will end the same way I entered with respect and well wishes to you and those around you, take care and be safe, thanks for reaching out, but mostly for caring. Hope I helped and if you have anything further I will be here.</br></br>

Sincerely.</br></br>

PS Sorry about the sloppiness throughout this letter, I was trying to get it in the wind.
