This story was told by a person incarcerated at Solano.</br></br>

Caller: Everybody's going through it right now and we just definitely need some help. Definitely need some. There's no medical staff, there's no outside people saying what's going on.</br></br> 

They wait till 7:00, 8:00 in the evening to start moving people that say they're positive, to say they're negative. But they are not giving them no receipts, no documents. We don't know where these other people are coming from, and they moving us into this gym that's not clean or sterilized.</br></br>

No mattresses. I mean, it's just simple. No hot meals, no nothing. And there's no, all my tests have come back negative. So why have I been moving to three or four different places? I haven't got any symptoms yet or anything that I was positive or anything.</br></br> 

And the same with other people. The medical doctors and nurses say, "You're negative." But then when the lights go out, or the shift changes, the sergeant or another officer comes in and says, "You're positive, you're going over here." I mean, where's the evidence, or the slip, or the receipt?</br></br>

You know, I mean, in these couple of months and I think the gym is over the capacity. And the judge sentenced the gym down saying it was unsafe, unsanitary, and unclean. And now he doubled into something double with the capacity. "I see you're not taking care of the medical issues. What's going on in here?"</br></br>

I mean, the tension is actually rising as we speak right now. And it's hard. Now, we really need some type of board to assist us through this process because it's really having a strain on people's patience and everybody. It's just out of control.
