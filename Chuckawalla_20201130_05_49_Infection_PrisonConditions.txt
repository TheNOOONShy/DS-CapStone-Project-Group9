This story was told by a person incarcerated at Chuckawalla.</br></br>

aller: It started out - it was our yard was the only yard that was clear of COVID-19 for months and then they emptied one whole building, they moved those people onto other yards that had COVID-19, and moved COVID-19 patients on our yard. And then the whole yard got infected.</br></br> 

UCI: And was that recently?</br></br>

Caller: Yes ma’am.</br></br>  

UCI: What is the troubling, or concerning to you?</br></br>

Caller: That they're willing to put our health at risk. You know? And not only that, they - so we end up in COVID-19 that they brought, that the COs brought to us. Okay.</br></br> 

So that’s one thing, and now they want to move us around in the middle of the night at like 10:30 till three in the morning. Moving us to different - while we’re sick. You know, If we’re sick, we should be left alone to heal, you know, because they’re not going to give us medication anyways.</br></br> 

So, there’s no reason to disrupt our program. They should just quarantine the building and let us get well where we’re at instead of moving us from place to place.</br></br>  

UCI: And how was the COVID-19 situation handled at your facility at the beginning of the outbreak?</br></br>

Caller: They all handed out these masks that, they’re not N-95s, they were just cloth masks and the COs didn’t care if you wore them, or not. A few would mention you, mention it to you to put your masks on, but most of them - they would let buildings go and visit each other. You know?</br></br>

They were supposed to separate us. Building nine stays from building 10, building 10 stays from 11, but some of the COs would just let us go to building 10 if we want. From building nine or building 11, they didn’t care.
