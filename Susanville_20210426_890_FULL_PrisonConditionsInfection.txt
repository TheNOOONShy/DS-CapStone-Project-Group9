This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Susanville.</br></br>April 23, 2021</br></br>To who? LOL</br></br>Hello. Would be nice to know who I'm writing. So my name is just on the website? Got the letter today, which most likely is the same letter you guys send to every inmate who happen to pop up LOL.</br></br>Maybe you guys can find me a pen pal. But ain't got nothing else today so guess I'll tell you how it's been here in Susanville. The worse prison in California if you're of color. They call it the White House.</br></br>So one day last year we get put on lock down due to the coronavirus. We are stuck in the dorm no yard nada! All of us inmates knew at some point that we were going to catch COVID-19.</br></br>We wouldn't have even come in contact with it at all if they did what the state said and stopped all transfers. It's not like we can just go out or go anywhere for that fact.</br></br>The warden knowingly let a bus full of inmates from San Quentin that had the coronavirus. It was all over the new that there was an outbreak there. She could have turned that busy away! Put all of our lives and her employees at risk.</br></br>Then they said we are suppose to stay six feet away from one another hah! We sleep less than three feet away from each other. Twenty-four men to a very small dorm two showers, two sinks, two shitters.</br></br>As soon as those inmates came here, the whole prison ended up getting sick. Some inmate got it twice! I ended up getting COVID-19 and it wasn't nothing nice. I would not have gotten it if the warden did her job!</br></br>If the public, well people who care! Seen how we are treated here at this prison, maybe that's why they are closing it down! That God yay!</br></br>Here a lil 'bout what they do! If someone pisses them off or comes by the door of your dorm, they come in trash your house take all of your stuff like CD players HP3 ex ex then sale it back to you. But that's another story.</br></br>Maybe if I hear back from whoever this is I could tell another story.</br></br>Always.
