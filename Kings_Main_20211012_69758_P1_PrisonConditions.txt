This story was told by a person incarcerated at Kings County Jail.</br></br>

Caller: I was telling her that, you know, these – these – these COs they don’t – they don't do no walk. Like here at the jail, they do walks every 30 minutes. Every 30 minutes, they do a walk.</br></br> 

They come by and they – they beat the doors and they do a count, you know? Every 30 minutes. At the reception centers in prison or prisons, you don't see them.</br></br>

They don't do walks. They don’t do – they'll do one walk in the morning and one walk when they get ready to go home; about maybe 20 minutes to 30 minutes before they go home, they'll do a walk. That's it.</br></br>

That’s it. The rest of the time, you know, that’s hours. Think about that; that's eight, nine hours. They're – they’re there for hours. You're just in there.</br></br> 

Either getting beat up by your bunkee or - or – this – also lots of people are dying. And – and like, man, why’s the response, like, that man was dead a whole hour. And people wonder – people wonder why that – hey, that guy – that guy was dead for a whole hour, that guy was dead for 45 minutes without you even knowing?</br></br>

And they try to – they try to – that's where a lot of the illegal, the – the falsified documentation and stuffs like people don't want to get in trouble because they're not doing what they're supposed to be doing.</br></br> 

A man is in there hollering for his life. "Hey! Hey!" “I am–” "Hey, man down!" "Hey, I've got to get out of here!" And they just laugh.</br></br>

Ma'am, I'm not telling you something that I've heard. I’m telling you something that I’ve seen. That I’ve seen. That I’ve experienced myself.</br></br> 

"Hey man, look, I've gotta get out this cell. Me and him are not compatible. Look, I’m – this is my life. This is for my safety. I have these safety concerns." They laugh at you.</br></br>

They laugh at you. "The only way you getting out this cell is if I see somebody bleeding." That's what they'll tell you.</br></br>

That's what happens in your prisons. That’s what happens in our prisons. Taxpayer’s money. People – people in these places and – this is what's going on.</br></br> 

Cameras are not even there. Cameras are only in certain parts of the prison. You go in the dayroom? There's no cameras in those dayrooms. There's no cameras pointing at those cells showing you what's going on.</br></br>

Like, here in this jail, you've got cameras – one, two, you’ve got two different cameras in this - in this pod right now. In this jail. One pointing at me, one pointing at the dayroom, one pointing towards the cells, and for all – they can see everything that's going on.</br></br>
 
They got cameras in this rotunda, cameras in the hallways; why don't you have cameras like that in these prison systems? So people can see what's going on, so you can go back and you can replay videos, so you can see what people are – can see what's going on, what happened to their family member, how their family member died.</br></br> 

What – what type of things is going on? Show them this process and what is – how this everything happens.</br></br>

And that’s – that's the honest to God truth, you know? It's real. And – and because a correction officer may not like a person or may not like a charge a person has, they allow you to get hurt.</br></br> 

They allow you to get punched on and – and hit – striked – you know, while they turn a blind eye. They're the very ones that's showing people your paperwork on their computer screens. And that’s – that's illegal. You can’t – you're not supposed to be able to do that, you know?</br></br>

It's all fun and games, you know? There's things in life you have to laugh at, there’s things that – but stuff like that? That's not funny.
