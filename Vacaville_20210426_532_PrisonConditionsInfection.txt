This story was told by someone incarcerated at Vacaville.</br></br>

UCI: So, how are you today?</br></br>

Caller: I'm very blessed. How are you?</br></br>

UCI: I'm good, that's good to hear. So which facility are you currently housed at?</br></br>

Caller: I'm calling from California Medical Facility in Vacaville, California.</br></br>

UCI: Okay, and what has the COVID situation been like at your facility?</br></br>

Caller: What's that?</br></br>

UCI: What has the COVID situation been like at your facility?</br></br>

Caller: I didn't hear that, say that one more time?</br></br>

UCI: What has the COVID situation been like at your facility?</br></br>

Caller: Oh, it’s been, it's been ups and downs but mostly they got it under control. Like about, I don't know, six months ago it was really bad. People were dying and stuff. They were quarantining a lot of people. But after that it got pretty good.</br></br>

It's like, it's pretty, it's pretty laid back now. You mean, it's not real, it's not real restrictive now, you know. It's kind of well, we gotta stay 6 feet apart and wash their hands and we still eat in our cells and stuff like that, and wear a mask.</br></br>

We've got to wear a mask and yeah, I mean. But if you, if you follow the rules and do what's right it works out pretty good, yeah.</br></br>

UCI: Okay, you say you guys eating your cell how does that work?</br></br>

Caller: They just bring when they, they, they bring the meal to our room and they deliver them.</br></br>

UCI: Okay.</br></br>

Caller: Like having room service. It's like room service. You gotta make the best of it you know.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah I understand so-</br></br>

Caller: Anytime-</br></br>

UCI: I'm sorry, go ahead.</br></br>

Caller: Oh, anytime you go to the chow hall where there’s like a couple hundred.</br></br>

UCI: Mhm.</br></br>

Caller: That’s where I get this stuff like, like bread and stuff like that. But they've been testing us a lot here, you mean, I already got both of my shots.</br></br>

UCI: Okay.</br></br>

Caller: I got both of my Moderna, the Moderna.</br></br>

UCI: Yes.</br></br>

Caller:  Yeah, we yeah. I think this because this is a medical facility so there's a lot of high risk people and stuff like that. So, they came and they gave most, mostly all of us our one and two shots.</br></br>

UCI: Okay.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, I’ll be quiet and let the, let you ask questions and I will answer them.</br></br>

UCI:  No, you're fine, that was my next question. I was just going to ask like, how has the vaccination situation being since people have been getting vaccinated now. So I just wanted you to like elaborate on that, and you know?</br></br>

Caller: No, they gave it. Yeah, it's it's it's, they come, they come around. They give us all the shots because like I said, this is a medical facility and, and people have a lot of weak immune systems and, cancer. And you mean, all different diseases and stuff like that. You know, they give it to you too. I guess pro- prolong your life.</br></br>

UCI: Mhm, okay and so how have you been coping with the crisis of COVID-19?</br></br>

Caller: I, well I’ve been doing pretty good, you mean, in just making the best of it. It’s just been, you mean, washing my hands, wearing my gloves, and wear, using universal precautions.</br></br>

And, and, just I worked down in the, I work down in the emergency room where they bring people down there and then that's a high risk area where you meet people. They bring people they think have it and they, then they quarantine them in another area.</br></br>

Even if you get exposed to the, say if somebody comes in there and they have it, or a staff member comes in and they and they were infected with it. Then they quarantine us for 14 days in another part of the prison and stuff like that.</br></br>

That happened to me one time they quarantined me, but I was in there from, I was quarantined for like I mean, I, I guess about a month. You know what I mean?
