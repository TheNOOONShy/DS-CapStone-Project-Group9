I seen this pandemic from the very start, soon as it came on the news. At first I didn’t think it was going to kill as many people as it did.</br></br>

I was scared! The prison I’m at, which is in Sacramento SAC, dealt with us by only letting a little amount of inmates out at a time. That seemed to work.</br></br>

Also my father who lives in Mexico, about September 2020 contracted the virus and maybe because his age, he was 84, within two weeks he passed away. That told me this virus was for reals.</br></br>

Also around October 2020 I don’t know what happen, about half the inmate population in my housing block caught COVID. The prison I’m at went on lockdown for a good six weeks.</br></br>

Luckily it was more symptomatic cases. Since March we all been vaccinated. They're still only letting 50 to 75 inmates at a time. We go outside to yard and get fresh air three times a week.</br></br>

Also since April 2021 we’ve all been vaccinated since none of us have caught COVID and that seems to be where we are.
