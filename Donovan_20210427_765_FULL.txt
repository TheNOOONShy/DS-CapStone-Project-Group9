This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Donovan.</br></br>

Cordial greeting once again,</br></br>

I was looking to reach out to you, where in the time that I did write you I had got at the Mexicans, where I did show them that of the project, where I did asked that art work be sent to you, where I placed a cash prize with that of for you to judge all the works submitted to you, and you would be the people on the streets to judge the work here, as whom you felt was the best, as well as working to submit that of writings too.</br></br>

Where I did work to do what I can and what I did was to personally get at [redacted], a company on the streets where I did order that of paints, to pencils, to ink. With that of where I did also buy that of paper that I did look to give to each person that was looking to do a drawing for you, and I was able to give them what was needed to help to do this. If by chance they did not have that of pencils to what else I had ordered, where I just did not want to lose that of my own personal property, so I had to make sure I did have a understanding on this as well as that of where in no games were to be played.</br></br> 

Well the bad news was that I went from down to R&R to get the items I did order, where I was told that the warden of the prison said to send it back, that same day.</br></br>

I was like it was not something that I was ordering, but something that I had already ordered. And it was not where it was to hear what I was saying, where it was well over 300 dollars worth of items that I did look to have in my cell to work with people. (Sorry) I did try, I do not know what to do, where I am to myself. Where to have outside help to show that of the willingness to help, where I was working out something to help prisoners bond on level that is not race lost where I did say that the only race I do know is that of just the human race.</br></br>

I have a two inch pencil, that is about all I do have at that with some Prisma cheap colored pencils, that are about the same size that are not much to work with, where I do not have the paper to do what I look to do. I can not erase what I need to do, where to set where I do need to set. So I am sorry at this time, I do not know when they will dick blick back in.</br></br> 

Where I do not know of anything that where we are able to order from, but that company. Plus the quality of what is needed, where there is not a order that is under 42 dollars at that. I order a lot that I did have to send back the first time.</br></br>

I just had to reink this ribbon today, where I did have too much on the pad. Where I have to run it off to get to where it will be where I can do the writings I need to do. Where it is where I did see that this ribbon was really on its last leg, where it seemed to have cut somehow. So there is any day that it will split and come apart.</br></br> 

So this is the last time I will used this one and go to a new one. I did not used this but a few times, maybe like 16 times, where I did reink it three or four times, where a ribbon last like five pages on both sides. Where I will be able to get more with this over inked ribbon at that this day.</br></br>

Some people look to see why I am able to have such dark letterings, where they feel that it is the typewriter they have that is not what I have. To where I did show them I do not use the same ribbons as they do as well, so that do have a lot to do with it. To that of the fact that I did reink my owns as well, as to why I have a lot darker looking than they do.</br></br>

I was sent the wrong ink as well too, where it was funny. I did get walnut for whatever reason, where I did asked that of specially that of black only. Maybe they did know that I did have to reorder all over once I did get what I did not want but it is working, so I do what I can. We just had came off that of the lock down, where it was set people get that of a visit, once each weekend for 30 to 60 minutes.</br></br>

Where we did go back on that of just one building on the yard, and one section at a time for dayrooms. Where the outbreak as well as that not one person on this yard had it in the first place, so we was placed back without visits and then we was all tested where 72 hours we was found to not have one person sick, or had it. So we came back off, to go back to the programming we did have where we open up more and more each week, as it shown that we do not have any reason to be locked down.</br></br>

It's just too cold for me to get out, where I will keep working to aid you, where I can. I did asked to get some stories, where I did look to have something, where in that same, it has not been anything nice going where it is. Where at the same time, there is that of where half the people on the yard is up for transfers, where it is wild up here.</br></br> 

Where we do have a yard full of level twos, and some are that of level fours. Where it is also that of a medical yard, where a lot of people need to go back to where they came from to go back to the prison they came from.</br></br>

East California Prison system sucks, where it is a major joke, where it is set on that of where it is not a protective program. But based on that of politically correct, instead of where all the people was protective custody yards, it is now called that of where we do come to that of where it is “sensitive needs yards”, where anyone can just lock up to get off a yard.</br></br>

If you do not like someone, you just have to say you have issues with him or her, and then you two are not to be on the same yards anymore. Where it was safety issue, where in the end it came to be where the yards with all the safety concerns, turned out to be the most violent yards. Where it came to where the CDCR want to break it up now at the expense of that of the GP, (general populations yards). Where it is that of what is a 50/50 yard, where you have all the sensitive needs people, on the yard with you, and that it's half and half.</br></br>

If you go to one you can not return to that of a GP yard. And that is where the cross come in, where the SNY people do know that once you are there and you can not come back, they will push up, to provoke that of a fight and then you get rolled up, not them. As not being able to program, where now you are not able to go back to the yard you came from. So sad.</br></br>

The prison is a design that is leveled to that of one through four yards, where it is a joke where to go to the hole is really a level five. Death row would be six, where the death row go to the hole to be with us on the same yards too. So it is where it is really the hole that is the highest level.</br></br>

All level two yards are where it comes to that of being a 50/50 yard where it is hide to be called that of a programming yard. That is not, where we are a fully programming yard, where we are not able to get all that we have coming based on we do not have SNYs on the yard with us. Where we do program each and every day, without the violence. But being GP, we do not get a lot of the programs geared for that of the SNY yards.</br></br>

So to go to a level two yard you will not find one that is you can go to, unless it is for medical and you do not have a reason to not be there. This is a undercover 50/50 yard, where 40 percent of the people are SNY who seem to be here, and where it is not a issue here as to what a lot of them are here.</br></br>

There are a few clowns here that feel that they can do what they want based on that of having life without, so that of it is not that they can be charged with more time to give them. But all they have to do is send them back to a level four yard, and the punks will cry like a baby that they really are so afraid to go back to where it is not a joke. To think that they can get away with what they do here, where to talk to that of the staff the way they do here is beyond anything I seen.</br></br>

And on a yard that is fully of body cams, and cameras on the yard and in the building. Oh well for all of that where it is what it is. But now a all new day with the different type of prisoners coming down here that do not have time for this, that most just look to be out the kill zone for a change, and may chill and not stab anyone or be stabbed up. One year clean you can get a override to a lower prison at that, so, it is not hard to get down here, just to stay is all that is to it.</br></br>

Do take care and I will keep looking to see what I can do.</br></br>

Sincerely and respectfully a man in deeds not just words.
