This story was told by a person incarcerated at Fire Camp.</br></br> 

Caller: Correct. So, what I was talking about was the numbers. So, on June the 20th, when we left, there was seven cases, I believe. Yeah, roughly seven cases.</br></br>

Within three weeks, there was over 100 cases. Active positive COVID cases. They were trying their best to isolate the inmates who were contaminated by putting them in the gymnasium on the A yard on the level one and two side.</br></br>

And on the level C block, which is for higher-level inmates three and four, they were putting them in a quarantine block. So, it was in-cell living, yet they were quarantined.</br></br>

Now, one thing that I find to be interesting, that I continue to bring up to staff is, I have personally been quarantined roughly 11 times since October of last year. Most of the inmates that were going from -- coming from reception to Jamestown, or going from Jamestown to a camp, or from other reception facilities to other facilities, we all have to go through a quarantine process.</br></br>

When we leave county jail, we get quarantine on the way into county jail, and we quarantine on the way out of county jail. We get quarantine when we hit reception; we get quarantine as we leave reception.</br></br>

So, the COVID-19 can't -- should not be coming in through the inmates. The COVID-19 is coming through -- through free staff and correction officers. So, I'm sitting there going, well, why am I the one quarantining when you're the one who's giving it to me?</br></br>

UCI: Exactly. Exactly.</br></br>

Caller: Because -- do you remember when AIDS was a big deal back in the 1980s and 90s?</br></br>

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: They had people going around, and they were pricking people with needles that had the AIDS virus on it.</br></br>

UCI: Right.</br></br>

Caller: And there was also a couple of cases where people were having intercourse knowing that they have HIV, they're HIV positive and they didn't tell the other person and district attorneys in New York and Los Angeles, in other major cities, Chicago, they were picking these cases up and charging attempted murder.</br></br>

UCI: Really?</br></br>

Caller: Oh yeah, most definitely.</br></br>

UCI: Jesus!</br></br>

Caller: My question is this - you can look that up; how, because, since the pandemic is so real and the Delta variant is killing people all over the nation, how is it possible to not hold these corrections officers liable for afflicting inmates and/or exposing them to COVID-19?
