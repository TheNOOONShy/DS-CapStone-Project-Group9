This letter was written by a person incarcerated at CMC (California Men's Colony).</br></br>

I would like to begin by thanking you for your caring thoughts and warm wishes. I am grateful for those of you that have taken an interest in the lives of the men behind bars during a time like this. So thank you.</br></br>

I would be happy to share my story. I've also passed the information few others that had a story to share, so I hope for a good turnout. So I'll begin, it's February 23, 2021, we have been on this lockdown for nearly a year. March of 2020 was the month the virus first arrived at CMC according to the prison staff. I along with many others had gotten sick around December of 2019.</br></br>

There was no testing at that time, so the flu-like symptoms that I felt, I thought were normal, other than why I couldn't taste anything? Once the symptoms were being broadcasted on the news, I finally understood this was no ordinary flu. I didn't mention this to my family, so not to worry them.</br></br>

By April, we no longer had any program, visits were shut down first, and everything else followed. The prison had been turned on its head. The staff couldn't figure out what to do, nor do I feel that they really saw the seriousness of what was happening.</br></br>

I worked as a counselor clerk. My job was to help the inmates and staff. I had been in that position for about two years. I choose this job because it allowed me to help my prison community.</br></br> 

It became my way of giving back after spending so many years in prison, either giving nothing or taking from the community, but I'll express that part a bit later.</br></br>

Once this sickness hit, it no longer was isolated to free staff or CO. This virus was out of control. 60 guys at a time were showing signs, and from those people, it spread. We were on a 24-hour lockdown which means we don't come outside for any reason short of life or death.</br></br> 

No visits, phone calls, schools, group, church. There was nothing other than for the men to find reasons to wake up in the morning and stay productive, work out, study, read any thing you could get your hands on. It was very difficult.</br></br>

The guys that had TVs in their rooms, watching the news all day, left most overwhelmed with nothing else to do but worry about that might be happening with our families. Everyone was feeling the effects, men need some comfort at some point.</br></br>

After a while, I and a few others volunteered every minute we could to help with any program that could help the men of CMC. We started working to ensure that inmates were able to receive commissary delivered to their cells, which in prison is a major morale boost. And being denied just about everything else, I felt it was important to do what we could.</br></br>

Another project I was able to do was gather donations for the inmates that are disabled, mentally or physically. We are able to send items we gather for the nursing staff to pick up and pass out. I'm very grateful to be allowed to take part in this program. I've become an ADA worker which means I'm able to help those men perform things that they may not be able to without assistance. So my time has been spent trying to help those around me and preparing for parole board.</br></br> 

Which is me summing up information from almost every self-help group I've taken and how I have changed my life since coming to prison.</br></br>

Currently I'm gathering letters of support from family and friends, positive people in the community that have been a part of my life and change while I've been in here, and those that will take part in my growth when I'm released. I've made a contact at UC Riverside to gather information that could help my transition back into society.</br></br>

The last 22 years in prison has left me with so much to learn, currently I'm pursuing my AA degree in sociology. I was a late bloomer regarding my education. I finally got my GED at age 39, now I'm in pursuit of a higher education.</br></br>

If there is anyone I could establish a contact with that may be able to assist with school information and community resources or after getting to know me, would send a letter to the parole board to speak about what they know about me, I would be grateful. The Parole Board views positive communication with members of society as a major benefit.</br></br> 

I am on a journey of growth and will continue this long after I'm free of these prison walls. So building relationships with groups and people in the community is very important to me.</br></br>

With that said, I wish you the best of luck with the project. I'll be here any time you need input or assistance. Thank you again.
