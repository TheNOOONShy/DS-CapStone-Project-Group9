This story was told by a person incarcerated at San Quentin.</br></br>

Caller: San Quentin State Prison. After 28 people died, we are finally getting vaccines out. They started vaccinating people, 65 years of age and older, and people with high risk. And so that's really, really, really good, but my thing is, is, is how do people out there feel about them, us all getting vaccinated before the people out there get vaccinated.</br></br> 

But it's a good thing that we are getting vaccines, and I feel a little bit better now, but I will feel a lot better once I receive the vaccine. So until I receive the vaccine, I'm still, I'm still testing negative, and I'm still scared for my life, but I take it one day at a time. And you guys, out there in society, please think about us. Please pray for us.</br></br> 

And, know that we are taking it one day at a time, and we are standing strong, and we really, really, really appreciate, the work that you guys out there doing on our behalf. Thank you.
