This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Solano.</br></br>As per your request on how I feel about my safety inside prison, quite honestly, it’s been such a scary experience on so many levels. First we're lockdown for 23 hours and 45 minutes a day, only to come out our cell for fifteen minutes a day, to do one of the two things and that is either to take a shower or use the phone, or one or another. As far as reduced visitation from family and loved ones is concerned a more accurate account of visitation is there has been no visitation during the pandemic.</br></br> 

CDCR has posted that they are considering giving tablets to do educational schoolwork and video visitation on, but nothing yet. They gave a website that family can have video visitation, but it hasn’t worked at all until March 12, 2021 which was the first-time inmates have been able to utilize this option.
