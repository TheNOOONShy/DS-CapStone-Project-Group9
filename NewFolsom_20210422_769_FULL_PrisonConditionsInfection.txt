Hello dear PrisonPandemic,</br></br>

I am writing a short letter to let you know that these people indirectly let me know today, that they know of my phone call to you all last night. They record every inmate's phone calls at every California State Prison.</br></br>

That is one of the reasons I said it's not an issue for me to be anonymous. An inmate has to use their PID:ID number to use the phone.</br></br>

Now, all of a sudden, someone from the department comes to see me. Claims he was checking to make sure I was getting everything I need while the building is on quarantine. That is a lie.</br></br>

Over the last 13 months of pandemic programming and the building on quarantine four other times, where was he at with this so-called concern? There are two inmates in other cells in this section. But I am the only inmate he came to see. I wonder why.</br></br>

The first question he asked me, are you having any issues with your cane? When they first came at me in July 2017. First thing they took was my cane for writing health care appeals against the doctors.</br></br>

Then stripped me of all of my durable medical equipment and went so far as to say I did not have sarcoidosis disease. Even though the bone marrow reconfirmed sarcoidosis disease July 2017 conducted as San Joaquin General Hospital. First diagnosed in 1992. That's just to show how far these people will go.</br></br>

I have many more stories and I am all in no matter what.</br></br>

Sincerely.</br></br>

P.S. I am tired of all the lies and corruption.
