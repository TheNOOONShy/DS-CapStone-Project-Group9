This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Chino.</br></br>

I find myself wondering where to begin...</br></br> 

Seeing just how messed up everything here has been. Chino prison and here on the A yard has been hit quite hard there with the COVID-19 pandemic. We lost at least 21 deaths. We're also experiencing a complete lack of real life saving measures here in CIW.</br></br> 

Staff here as well as the medics! Personal have been at odds right from the start. Personally - I've been tested nine times for COVID-19. I've tested negatively all nine times. 

So what does staff here decide I should do? Is to be housed over on B yard in a building, which is full of positive tested men from all four yards down here. For my health they tell me. Even though I've never tested positive for having COVID-19. 

I must be held in quarantine status, in a building full of positive men for the COVID house. Once or if I survive that ordeal. I must be then housed over on C yard within a cell and not the dorm where I've tested negative eight times.</br></br>

Go figure. So I'm forced to submit to the move or face a serious rule violation report. So I get house on B yard within a cell which positive men just left, for 20 days and 20 nights, to be resent right back to the same yard I left for. Only this time i must live in a tent out on the yard.
