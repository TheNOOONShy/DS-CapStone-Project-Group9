This story was told by a person incarcerated at Merced County Jail.</br></br>

UCI: And you can share whatever you would like.</br></br>

Caller: Well, first of all, they don't treat us right in here because they don't let us do nothing. We ain't even got no chapel or none of that. We're supposed to have a chapel or somebody to come talk to us, like a counselor or something.</br></br> 

And they don't have none of that stuff in here since the pandemic, I guess. And, like, we don't go outside. We only go outside once a week and that's boring. Like, we should be able to go outside more than just once a week.</br></br>

And then, they don't treat us right in here. They give us, like, made up food that they made, some stuff. Ever since the pandemic, it's just weird. And we don't have nothing, like, they don't act right.</br></br> 

We don't get to go, like, nowhere. We ain't even got no library in here just to read books and stuff and we're supposed to have a new [unintelligible].</br></br>

But I don't know, they just don't, they don't help us like that. They don't. They act like we're just animals in a cage. And, like, we don't get no visiting or none of that. We ain't got visiting online or nothing. Other counties got it online.</br></br> 

We can't even get those online. And we've been trying to tell them to get visiting online, but they don't let us. Hello?</br></br>

UCI: Hi, yes. I'm listening. I'm here.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, they just like, they treat us like animals. They don't let us do nothing.</br></br>

UCI: That's horrible to hear. Thank you for sharing that. Do you - what do you think the facility could have done to make the situation better? I know you mentioned there was reduced visitation. What has that been like?</br></br>

Caller: Huh?</br></br>

UCI: What do you think - oh, hello?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, what happened? I can't hear you. It's loud.</br></br>

UCI: What do you think your facility could have done to make the situation better?</br></br>

Caller: They could at least give us visiting. We can't even see our family members or nothing. Like, it's just whatever. They don't - like, other counties, they got visitings, like, on tablets and stuff. And we don't got none of that.</br></br>

UCI: Who has access to the tablets?</br></br>

Caller: I don't know, other counties like Stanislaus County and stuff and all that. Like, other counties. Fresno County. Like, we're the only county that don't got no visitors or nothing.</br></br>

UCI: Oh, I see.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah. So, they don't give us none of that.</br></br>

UCI: So, those tablets would have really helped, you think?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, if they gave them to us. But they say they don't give them, they don't want to give them to us.</br></br>

UCI: How have you been coping with all of this?</br></br>

Caller: Huh?</br></br>

UCI: How have you been coping with all of this?</br></br>

Caller: Just, I don't know, I just deal with it because there's nothing we can do. Because we're in here, so they look at us like just animals.</br></br>

UCI: Does your facility provide you with any masks or sanitizers to keep you safe at all?</br></br>

Caller: Like they give us masks only when we go to court. That's it, just a mask and not sanitizer, none of that. Like we're supposed to get all that, gloves, sanitizer. They don't give us none of that stuff. Just a mask.</br></br>

UCI: Wow, that is awful to hear. What about the vaccination situation? Have you gotten your vaccines? Are they providing that?</br></br>

Caller: No. Like, certain people, they gave it to, but certain people didn't take it because a lot of people get sick and stuff off of it. I was like, I'm going to wait and see if I should take that because I'm not sure. Because one of my friends took it and he had, like - took like, he's had problems and stuff.</br></br>

UCI: Oh, so the side effects?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, side effects, problems.</br></br>

UCI: Oh, okay. I see that. I see that.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah.</br></br>

UCI: How has the COVID situation at your facility affected your loved ones?</br></br>

Caller: A lot, like a whole bunch.</br></br>

UCI: Thank you so, so much for sharing that. Is there anything else you want people to know about your experience?</br></br>

Caller: Huh? What happened?</br></br>

UCI: Is there anything else you want people to know about your experience?</br></br>

Caller: No, not really. Nothing, really.</br></br>

UCI: Is there anything you think that your facility could have done better? Just, just treat you like humans, right?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, treat us like human beings instead of like animals. They've got us locked down and stuff. Other than that, it's really nothing else.</br></br>

UCI: Is there any social distancing in your facility or do they -</br></br>

Caller: Huh?</br></br>

UCI: Is there any social distancing in your facility?</br></br>

Caller: No. No. None of that.</br></br>

UCI: Hello, are you still with me? Hello?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah. Hello?</br></br>

UCI: Hello. Hi. So, no social distancing? They just let everyone in together?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah. We're all just, like, different cells. It's like, real messed up.</br></br>

UCI: Wow. That, that sounds horrible. I'm really sorry to hear that. And thank you so much for sharing all of this. It means a lot to us.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah. You're welcome.</br></br>

UCI: Hello?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah.</br></br>

UCI: Oh, hi. Sorry, I didn't hear you. But yeah, thank you so much for sharing. Thank you for participating and I really appreciate it. I do.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah. That's cool.</br></br>

UCI: Thank you very much and I hope you have a great evening.</br></br>

Caller: Okay, you, too.
