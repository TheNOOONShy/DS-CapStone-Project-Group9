Infection</br></br>Program changed, yard was only one building at a time and split the day room. I guess to contain the virus.</br></br>Then we went on full lockdown when COVID cases went up drastically. It happened twice, no yard, day room, or school. On the second lockdown we heard that someone from our yard (B yard) had passed away from COVID-19 complications.</br></br>Sometime during that period around November 2020 I started going through some symptoms. Excuse my horrible spelling. I was weak, lightheaded, I had really bad headaches, my heart started racing, I had shortness of breath.</br></br>I had to ask for medical attention at least three times and they just told me that I was having a panic attack and anxiety. They checked my vitals and my temperature, and I guess they didn’t see anything abnormal.</br></br>I asked if I can be checked out by cardiologist but they shot me down because I wrote on a totally different medical slip “I don’t need medical attention.” But I wrote that totally unrelated to the symptoms I described above.</br></br>Later, one of the staff told me straight up, that we were not getting the care we have coming because of COVID-19. I then realized that they started using that excuse for a lot of things.</br></br>I guess I understand the CDCR was probably overwhelmed and over all they did an OK job of keeping us safe. But me having these scary symptoms felt that I needed urgent help. Till this day I don’t know if I caught COVID-19, but I still feel some small symptoms. I just feel a little traumatized.</br></br>By February 2021 they offered us the Moderna vaccine. I already took both of my shots. Now is the end of April and we are getting visits. I already got a few.</br></br>So after a pretty fucked up year excuse my language. Things are slowly starting to look normal. I only pray that our people, our families take good care of themselves. I took the vaccine just to show my parents and my girl that is safe. They don’t trust it, so I had to assure them it was safe.</br></br>
