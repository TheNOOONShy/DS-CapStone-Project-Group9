There is a very real possibility I will never see them again as they are in their 70â€™s and in poor health. Throughout this time, I have remained positive. The outside organizations who volunteer here (redacted), send in assignments for those enrolled in their classes, which has helped many people here. The recreational therapists who work for the mental health department consistently go door to door offering self-help packages, puzzles, and games, and making sure the population is ok.</br></br>

Overall, the real way to measure if this institution performed well during this pandemic is whether or not the wives of inmates were threatened. For that, I would say it has been a success, we have been blessed with very low positive tests. And very few deaths my complaints are about the general lack of awareness, and the carrying out of policy at the lower levels. But these are systemic issues that arise on any occasion.
