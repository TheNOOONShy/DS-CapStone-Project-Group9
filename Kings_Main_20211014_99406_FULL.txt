This story was told by a person incarcerated at Kings County Jail.</br></br>

UCI: Just start where you left off from.</br></br>

Caller: It's - in a nutshell, that affected a little bit of, I wouldn't say relationships totally, but it's - it's messed up - it's messed up me. It messed up me. It messed up me and the way I thought of myself.</br></br>

It - it messed up - because you're having me, you know, do these things, and technically, I really shouldn't have to do it, you know? Now, as you - a person looks up and a person sees, and they're like all kind of people like I - I have a good friend that's - he's like a father figure. He's - well, a couple of those, you know?</br></br>

And one of them, he works here in the jail, you know? Another one used to be a highway patrolman, you know? And he used to - he looked it up, and he said, "you know" - he said "that's" - he said "that's" - he said "I looked that up."</br></br> 

And he said "you know what, that's - that's crazy." He said, "That's not even a serious thing." He said, "That's not serious at all."</br></br>

He said, "That's not serious." He said "that's - it's." He said, "You shouldn't even have to-" And he said "And you know you can file a petition and have that-" you know? All this thing he said, it's been over, I don't know how long. He said, "Now that's 2008," and he said "now you're in 2021," you know?</br></br>

You know I don't have no charges. No crazy charges, no rape charge, no child molestation charge. I don't have none of these crazy charges. I don't have none of those in my record. None of those charges in my record at all. So I'm like you know - you know hey, I just don't - the law is - a lot of legal jargon I don't know how to do, you know?</br></br>

But I'm not saying I can't learn it, but it - there's a lot of legal stuff. It's a lot to - legal - it's a lot behind this legal stuff. It's a lot of terms, terminology, different terminology used, and it's just a lot to learn.</br></br>

But, you know, bascially and from that - like I said, that was back in 2008, you know? And right now, it's 2021, you know? I still have a drug addiction, you know? I still, you know, I've struggled.</br></br> 

Throughout this whole time from 2008 to 2021, I've been out for minor things, under the influence, you know, just little - little things that are you know, just you know, they add up, you know? And I've had a lot of things done wrong, you know, to me. I've done wrong too, you know? I'm not perfect.</br></br>

But at - it's - during this - during this pandemic, it's already been tough for me because I can't even get my life together. I can't even - I can't - I can, but I can't - I can't manage a - I can't get a job. I've never had a job.</br></br>

I've never had a job as in - I'm 33 years old now. My birthday just passed last week. I was October, you know, me and my mom's, you know, same day.</br></br>

It's - it's - I've never had a job as a grown man. I've never had a cell phone in my name as a grown adult male. I've never had a bill under my name, not with me - my knowledge, you know? I've never had a bill in my name, you know?</br></br>

I've never lived with a significant - I've never lived with a woman, a spouse. I didn't even live on my own. I've never even had a - I've drove many cars, you know - never one of my own.</br></br>

The last time I had my California ID was back in 2008 - 2007. That's the last time I had my California - the last time I've seen my picture, my address, my name on a ID, on a California ID, DMV, you know?</br></br>

That's - that's a lot - and that's a lot from me. A lot of drug use - the drug use, being under the influence. Not being able to handle my responsibilities. Not being able to - to do things that a responsible adult does because I'm under the influence.</br></br> 

What people should be studying is people on meth. That - that drug - that drug is not a joke. It's not like it's - I've never tried heroin, but - but it's not like marijuana. It's not powder cocaine. It's not like ecstasy. It's not like any other. A person has to see - it's speed.</br></br>

It's like - it's - have you - I don't know if a person ever seen that movie Limitless, but it's with Bradley Cooper in it. A person has to see that movie to see what that - what that man is going on a high.</br></br>

He's moving - he's moving so fast. He's moving so fast, and it - it's like - it intensifies. It - it - your - you become brave. You become anything you want to, you know? You're not afraid. You're kinda - you're kinda - you're not afraid to jump out there.</br></br>

But the things that were going on with me was, yeah, it gets you to like work toward - it makes you not think before you react. You just react. It makes you see things that are not there, and then things - there's some things you do see that is there; you don't know how to react to it, though.</br></br>

You don't know what to do with it because your mind is - is moving so fast. And then you're in a state of mind that you're not adequate within yourself because you're not you. You're not you.</br></br>

You can't - you're - you're not taking care of yourself. Or you're - you're talking too fast. You're eyes are - you can tell you're not comfortable with the state of mind and where you're at.</br></br> 

You can't have conversations with people because you're - it's not - you're one - you're one thing, you're somewhere else and they're somewhere else. They have a rational thinking mind. They're calm, they're cool, collected, you're just  just off the walls, you know?</br></br>

And through this whole process you know, this COVID process - from 2008 to 2021, I've been incarcerated in and out, in and out, you know? You know I've never - it's been over ten years I haven't - I haven't had a sober day in my community. Imagine that.</br></br>

Imagine being drunk under the - on beer or being under the influence of a - of a pill, of a substance every day out there in society, in the community, and you're interacting with people. You're doing things, you're making choices and decisions, and everything is with an altered state of mind, you know?</br></br>

And it's hard for you to do things. It's hard for you to even set an appointment at the DMV. It's hard for you to man - it's hard for you to do anything.</br></br>

You don't have a California ID, so you can't get a free government phone. Because you didn't refuse right and left, because you don't have the necessities of what they're asking for.</br></br>

They tell me I need a welfare card, just to show up for a card, I bring a welfare card, and they say you need your ID too, you know? And because you're so down on yourself and you're feeling some type of way about yourself, and it's - it's a struggle for you because you're high on the drugs, you know?</br></br>

It's hard for you to manage and prioritize your life and set things together it's - because the drugs controlling you. That - that you can't even sit there and do that. And you just give up. You give up.</br></br>

So, you know, in this place with this COVID, it just - all it did was make it worse kinda. And in a way, it made it worse where it's - kind of lost touch with being around people. It made - you being around people - being away from people at a distance, you know, that didn't help. In other ways, it did help, but in some ways, it didn't, you know?</br></br>

You know, it's still - it's still relevant, I would say. It's still very much relevant. To get help - I need help more than ever, you know? This time in my life, I've reached out several times through parole.</br></br>

Parole didn't assist me in anything. They just allowed me to stay out - I couldn't go into the parole office because they were - they were keeping a distance from people. How can you sit there and - and - and I was - they weren't even testing me at the parole office, you know? Because they were keeping, you know, it's just crazy, you know what I mean?</br></br>

Maybe some people need that, some people understand that, you know, but it's like it's just wild. I just - I just got out, you know February of this year, you know? And May, I'm incarcerated, you know?</br></br>

They're not communicating. It's just so much that - that's going on, you know? It's wrong, you know? It's - it's wild, you know?</br></br>

I just - there's a lot of things that should be looked into, you know, the way - the way our system is, programs for everyone, not just for a select few. There should be programs for everyone. And people should have a more clear understanding of charges.</br></br>

And certain people shouldn't have to - this is - this is old, you know? And just it sucks - it sucks to go through this, you know? Like I said it's - it's - I guess I'm at a point in my life where it's - I'm tired of - I'm tired of going through this. I'm tired of hitting these roadblocks. I'm tired of being alone.</br></br> 

I'm tired of not being able to display the type of person and type of heart that I have, who I am as me, you know? I'm tired of not being able to have a civil and normal conversation with a woman. I'm tired of not being able to - to go out and get a job and work. 

I'm tired of being overlooked. I'm tired of not being heard, you know? I'm just tired of a lot, you know?</br></br> 

People telling you what you can do, what you can't do, you know? And this - the things they're telling you can and can't do, is - it's - it's technically not against the law; it's not wrong. And you know, and I'm just tired - tired of hearing those types of things, you know it's-</br></br>

A person will tell you that you can't be in a relationship; you can't talk to this person. Or it's not - it's unethical. It's - I'm just tired of all that, you know? I'm ready for a change.</br></br>

I ready for a - I want a change. I want a change in my life. I want - I wanthelp. I want assistance, you know?</br></br>

It's - when you come in these systems like this, people don't understand you have to pay an attorney to help you. In order for an attorney to help you, you have to pay - you have to pay them. Because when you get a court-appointed attorney, they're getting paid no matter what. They're getting paid no matter what.</br></br>

And the person does not - all they do they go back there in that DA's office and they make deals with that DA. "Hey, look, man, you give me him this time, and I'll give you him. I'll give you him." Well you give me - that's just - that's all they do.</br></br>

That's what they do, and it's not right. It's not right because you're playing with people's lives. "You give me him, I give you him;" what do you mean by that? How can you sit there and do that?</br></br>

You know, when you're educated in the law, you got - you get a degree, you pass the bar exam - you know, they're smart. They understand the law and they use legal - legal jargon, politically correct terminology and they do things inside the law to make up for their wrongs and the things that they're doing. They use the law to justify it, to make it look okay, to make it look right.</br></br>

But if a person really dug into what they're doing, they would see it's not right. In my situation, I'm on parole. I got out February of this year, and I have to say because of my drug - my drug - my drug habit, I failed to charge my monitor.</br></br>

I had a GPS monitor, and I failed to charge it. I had a hard time charging it, keeping up with it, so I was always misplacing one and would have to get a new one.</br></br>

Well, I had went to church one day and - and I had left my charger at the church. And as I - as I left, the guy told me I could come back and get it later; when I went back to get it later, he was no longer there.</br></br>

So, I went to the back of the church, they were holding a NA meeting, a drug-outpatient program, and I attended. I attended and went and sat down. Like man, something told me, like God was talking to me and said, "Sit down and join the group," you know?</br></br>

So I did, and afterwards, I asked the people there if they knew this gentleman so I can get my - my charger that was inside of the building, inside of the office. They said that he was no longer - that they didn't know how to reach him, so they said late at night already.</br></br> 

I'm - I'm wondering well, what's going on, why my charger, my monitor, my leg is dying. It's vibrating, let me know it's on dead status, it's getting dead - it's going dead.</br></br>

So I see an officer that I'm familiar - this is a small town, so everyone knows everyone. And I see this woman - I see this officer on a traffic stop. So I see her and approach her and ask her for assistance.</br></br>

I say, you know, I let her know the situation, what's going on, my charger - my monitor's going dead, it's vibrating, and she refers me over to her partner because she said she was busy. So she refers me to her partner that's just arriving to assist her in this traffic stop.</br></br>

So I go and I tell him the same thing that I'm telling her. He tells me, why don't you sit in front of the parole office for the rest of the night? It's gonna be dead.</br></br>

How is that gonna help anything? These officers, they all have a number for probation, parole. They have an officer on call that they call on their phones, on your cell phones.</br></br>

If you're ever in a situation to where they pull you over, maybe they see that something you're around, somebody else that's another felon or whatever the case is, whatever the reason is, they stop you, and they'll ask - they'll call and they'll ask, "Hey, what do you want us to do? This person is so and so; so and so, he's on parole. What would you like us to do?"</br></br>

"Oh, you can let him go. Just tell him to show up tomorrow," or whatever or "Yeah, bring him in and put him on 3056, a hold," you know?</br></br>

So, - so but - so that right there - so that right there, what they didn't do - they failed to make that phone call. Even I notified them and let them know that I don't have my charger, so I mean, it's gonna die. I let them know that.</br></br>

The very same, that same morning - literally that day, I was booked into the Kings County Jail for - for a 3056, on a hold. And my violation was one, failure to charge my monitor. And he says in his statement that Mr. knows that he is - if it vibrates and is low battery status, then he is to notify me - call me or notify me.</br></br>

Well, I did that. I don't have a cell phone that I own, and I explained to you the reasons why, what's going on with me and my life and my struggle and my addiction, so what I did was the next best thing.</br></br>

I reached out to a law enforcement agency that it has the means to contact you right then and there. On their side, they have a cell phone, they have that - they have that number to reach the officer of the day, an agent that's on call. They failed to do that.</br></br>

When I notified them, my attorney, she's not helping me. I ended up coming - I was already initially out on citation waiting to go to court for other matters, for minor misdemeanors or whatnot; and as I'm waiting, so - so when they brought me in on that 3056 hold, that - they brought up all the other stuff that I was cited out on.</br></br>

And that they gave them, so they held me - and initially, they shouldn't have been able to hold me on, and if my attorney would've advocated for me and went to a hearing - she didn't explain nothing to me, so I didn't understand - I didn't know. I was still coming down off of meth, you know? And she didn't say anything to me. She didn't help me in any type of way.</br></br>

She didn't tell me like, "You know what, no, let's go to the hearing, you know? Because yeah, you know what, let's get this officer on the stand. Let's call in this officer so that way we can get you exonerated from this violation because you know what you did reach out.</br></br>

You did reach out. You did reach out to try to get help. And you told this officer - you told these officers prior about this issue, that you were - that was going on - that was getting ready to die.</br></br>

It was their obligation to sit there and have you sat on that curb until they got done with their matter or the situation or call in somebody else to come and assist. But you did let them know. And they - and they - what they were supposed to do - yes, they were supposed to make a call, and they didn't do that."</br></br>

So, everything is blamed - basically blamed on me. I'm suffering a violation. They used the parole hold to hold me. And I'm like, this is - this crazy.</br></br>

Yeah, I was initial - I was initially cited out on these, but this is what it was - I was initially cited out on the other matters, so if they were - if they were - if they were to - that was their way of keeping me in there even though they knew - they know that I reached out. You saw - you saw, it's hard - how do you not know? You know, and it's like nobody came and spoke for me.</br></br>

She didn't even try to - to advocate for me in any type of way. But, again yeah it's - I don't know - I don't know if you - I don't know if you're maybe tired of hearing it.</br></br>

UCI: No, no.</br></br>

Caller: But it - if - am I - am I able to call back or no?</br></br>

UCI: Oh, yeah, you can call back.</br></br> 

Caller: Alright.</br></br>

UCI: Go for it.</br></br>

Caller: I'll call back one more time.</br></br>

UCI: Okay.</br></br>

Caller: One more time.</br></br>

UCI: Sounds good. Thank you.
