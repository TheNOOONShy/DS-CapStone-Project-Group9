This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Wasco.</br></br>To have your visitation reduced to family or loved one, it hurt your heart and your mind not to see your love one or hug them or hold your kids. It takes a lot out of you physically and mentally. I think they should have therapist for people recovery from COVID or people who lost love one while incarcerated.</br></br>Inmates that have a lot of anxiety or have sleep disorder, I been coping with these crises by staying positive reading book, looking at tv, exercising, writing letter to family or friends, join church group out state or in state. By washing my hands every chance I get wearing my mask and staying six feet apart.</br></br>Like our President Mr. Biden said, so we could prevent the spread to other people. I took the Moderna vaccine in here it was two doses one month apart. Even if it’s not FDA approved I hope it make a difference cause in my mind it has.</br></br>
