This story was told by a person incarcerated at Mule Creek.</br></br>

Caller: Well, on the 14th of December, I was called out of my regular housing unit, and I was told to, that I have, was tested positive for COVID-19 and to go pack my stuff. So, I was moved to another building, and I had questions, you know. And I asked to speak with a doctor, and I asked to be retested for COVID-19 because I haven't had any symptoms and I feel fine and I think it's a mistake.</br></br>

And they said, "Oh, too bad. We don't retest, and one test is enough." So, they locked me in another building with a bunch of COVID-positive people, and five days later I started feeling symptoms of COVID. And being HIV-positive, I found myself needing answers: "What do I do to protect myself? Do I need, you know, medication?"</br></br>

And so I put out a request for medical, and the medical was all denied, stating that it was not medically necessary that I'd be seen. So, they gave me some cough drops. I didn't have a cough. But it kind of upset me to get cough drops because when I was a small child, my grandmother would take me to church.</br></br>

And halfway through the sermon, as a little boy I would get restless, and my grandmother would give me bubblegum or a cough drop or something to keep me busy. And that's what the state went and did. And it's like, "Really?"</br></br>

And so after 14 days of being confined with no medical access, I seen a doctor that was going to clear me of COVID-19 no matter what I said. And sure enough, I was cleared of COVID-19 and sent back to a building with COVID-negative people.</br></br>

And I still have not seen a doctor. So, yeah, it has not been good. I didn't get a printout or a pamphlet or anything of what to expect, what was gonna happen, what would happen if I got really bad sick, nothing. You know, It was nothing. So, that's pretty much my experience with COVID in prison.</br></br>

UCI: Wow, I'm sorry to hear that. And what is troubling you or concerning you at this moment?</br></br>

Caller: Well, if - with my medical condition, is there - can I get it again?</br></br>

The HIV, are my numbers – do I need to see my specialist for that? I have questions. I don't have the symptoms. I still have body aches, but I don't have – I'm not sneezing or coughing.</br></br>

Nobody had a temperature. I never had a temperature. So, those are my concerns are, do I need medical attention?
