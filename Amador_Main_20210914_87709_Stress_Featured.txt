This story was told by a person incarcerated at Amador County Jail.</br></br>

UCI: And is there anything you think your facility could have done better to ease any of the troubles from the situation?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, they could have give us some way – some way to get outside. Being – being locked inside 24 hours a day for over a year now is – is tough.</br></br>

UCI: Mmhmm.</br></br>

Caller: There should have been some way to get outside for a little bit of time.</br></br>

UCI: Mmhmm. Well, thank you so much for sharing. Is there any other thing you – you would like people to know about your experience?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, there's a lot of people in here that don't have people to talk to, and they're going through – I don't know how – I – I have someone that I care about and I figure who cares about me, but there's a lot of people that are in here that are all alone.</br></br> 

UCI: Mmhmm.</br></br>

Caller: I don't know how they really feel about – I don't know how they really feel about if – if they're scared, if they're scared for family or – or what. They – they probably deal with it a lot inside themselves.</br></br>

UCI: Mmhmm.</br></br>

Caller: That's probably – that's probably one of the worst things, the – someone worried about something, and they don't let nobody know, and they just quietly worry about it themselves.
