This story was told by a person incarcerated at Chuckawalla.</br></br>

UCI: What is the current COVID-19 situation at your facility?</br></br>
Caller: Well, we have a building that’s in our yard that’s COVID. And everybody else, we have three yards, three buildings in our yard.</br></br> 

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br> 

Caller: One’s for COVID and the two upfront are just regular, I guess, people that already went through it.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah.</br></br> 

Caller: Are back at their buildings.</br></br>
UCI: And what is troubling or concerning to you?</br></br>
Caller: Well, what’s concerning to me is that I was okay, and then they said they detected COVID, so they separated us.</br></br> 

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>

Caller: But then they, they put me in the education building but then later they said, "No we’re gonna put you in the COVID building," where it's mixed with other people and other yards, like people that were sick.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>
Caller: As soon as I got there that’s when I felt something. Like I felt something hit me. And the next day I couldn’t, for four days I couldn’t eat, I couldn’t, you know, I couldn’t breathe, just getting much worse.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>
Caller: And then I had to go man down. I told them 'cause it was just hard for me to breathe, I couldn’t eat, I had nothing.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br> 

Caller: I just I felt terrible. So, they sent me to central health, and they gave me oxygen. But it was - I told them, "It was just, this is not - I don’t feel the same. Something is really wrong."</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>
Caller: So, they prescribed me pills. Pills that I guess, one was for seizures. Well, I never took seizures but the nurse told me it was for, to calm me down and some other pills. But I go, "I don’t wanna take pills, something’s wrong. I need to be check on."</br></br>

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>
Caller: So, they sent me to the hos- I go, "I need to go to the hospital." And they detected pneumonia. They detected, I guess, I don’t know what else.</br></br>
But they said, you know, "Yeah, we’ve got to rush you to the hospital." So, they flew me from a helicopter from [redacted] all the way to [redacted].</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>
Caller: And there they told me that, you know, "You're really, your lungs are really bad. We detected that you couldn’t breathe, we detected pneumonia". So, they said that, "There’s a chance you might not make it." Which pretty much scared me.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>
Caller: And then from there they said you know, they checked my blood, they checked everything and said, "You qualify for - what they gave the president, the Remdesivir." So, I was on five days, four, five days on Remdesivir. And after the third day I felt more, I guess more stronger. I guess I could breathe more and everything but still.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>
And then from there they sent me back to - back to the prison and central health. They held me there for five days to see a doctor saying, to be cleared. And ever since then yeah, just now I'm back so.</br></br>
UCI: Yeah. I'm sorry you had to go through that.</br></br>
Caller: Yeah. It was really, I mean I was fine but then as soon as they started mixing us that’s when it just, that’s when it hit me.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: And then, so-</br></br>
UCI: So how was COVID-19 handled at your facility at the beginning of the outbreak?</br></br>
Caller: It was terrible. They - pretty much we had rules where they didn’t want us to mix like another building.</br></br> 

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br> 

Caller: But then the COs would let them other people walk in like nothing.</br></br> 

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: People that were sick. And then we found out that the people that were coming in were infected.</br></br>
UCI: And is it being handled differently now?</br></br>
Caller: Somewhat. You still see some people coming into the buildings.</br></br>
UCI: Okay. And what have they improved on?</br></br>
Caller: I'm sorry.</br></br>
UCI: Have they improved on anything?</br></br>
Caller: I don’t really see anything improved. I mean, just more mask wearing. They’re more stricter on mask wearing. That’s, that’s pretty much everything.</br></br>
UCI: And what would make the situation at your facility better?</br></br>
Caller: What would what?</br></br>
UCI: What would make the situation at your facility better?</br></br> 
Caller: Well, if they were just more stricter on mask wearing.</br></br>
I mean, I know they’re, I know they’re trying to keep us separated, keep us six feet but it's just kind of impossible because we’re like sardines in here.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br> 

Caller: We’re just, there's just, there’s nowhere to space out.</br></br>

UCI: Right.</br></br>

Caller: And keep space. Everybody’s just pretty much just, "Okay. Well, just wear your mask and that’s it."</br></br>
UCI: Yeah. And how has the COVID-19 situation affected your loved ones?</br></br>
Caller: Well, first they tried to call to find out what was going on 'cause I called them and told them that I wasn’t feeling good. But the - I guess after the next day I went to the hospital, they were trying to call, trying to find out the prison. They wouldn’t give them any information.</br></br>
 
UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>

Caller: They kept calling and calling. They kept, "Hello we’re going to transfer you," and then nobody answering the phone and pretty much, yeah.</br></br>
They were worried for like 10 days I didn’t get in contact with them.</br></br>
UCI: Wow, that’s horrible.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah.</br></br> 

UCI: And so what has - oh, continue.</br></br>
Caller: I'm sorry go ahead. No, no go ahead that’s it.</br></br>
UCI: I was just going to ask you another question you can continue if you want with that question.</br></br>
Caller: No, no, no. That was it.</br></br>
UCI: Okay. So, what has it been like for you to have visitation - to have reduced visitation and programming?</br></br>
Caller: I'm sorry.</br></br>
UCI: What has it been like for you to have reduced visitation and programming?</br></br>
Caller: Well, it feels, you know, pretty much taking our rights - not rights but at least something taken away.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br> 

Caller: I mean, this is helping us get out faster, you know. This is help programs that are helping us get a, you know, to be better off.</br></br>

UCI: Right.</br></br> 

Caller: And we’re trying but they’re saying we can't go nowhere, we can't go to class, we can't do nothing.</br></br> 

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>

Caller: The only thing we have right now is our college classes to help us.</br></br>
UCI: Yeah. So, how have you been coping with the crisis?</br></br>
Caller: It's been overwhelming.</br></br>

UCI: Okay.</br></br> 

Caller: But pretty much that’s it.</br></br>
UCI: Yeah. Is there anything else that you would want people to know about your experience?</br></br>
Caller: It's just that our family members, you know, they’re the ones that suffer. They don’t know what’s going on.</br></br>
UCI: Yeah.</br></br> 

Caller: And there was no answers for them.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>
Caller: My mom she’s already 80, she was worried, crying.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller. And I told her, you know I told her, I told her I was "Gonna fight for it, don’t worry and I’ll be okay."</br></br>
But it's just, she had no answers. You know, she had so many questions and nobody gave her answers.</br></br>
UCI: Yeah. Right, I'm sorry. It's just a very -</br></br>
Caller: It was the hardest thing to go through, you know.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br> 

Caller: But everything’s okay now. You know everything’s great.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: But I could be better. Everything’s just getting stronger. So, I'm okay.</br></br>
UCI: Yeah. I'm so sorry to hear that you had to go through that and that your family was worried about you.</br></br>
Caller: Yeah. It's fine.</br></br>
UCI: Well, I think that’s all the questions that I have but we still have time if you wanted to add anything else or I'm not sure if you knew that we have a P.O. box.</br></br>
Caller: No, I didn’t know that. I mean, somebody just told me to call. They go look they just want your story to see what’s going on, you know?</br></br>
UCI: Yeah. If you wanted, I can give you our P.O. box and I’m not sure if we’re gonna be sending out newsletters or you guys can also send us letters. I'm not sure if you wanted that information.</br></br>
 Caller: I, I have  - I get letters from them. I get letters from-</br></br>

UCI: Oh, okay, okay.</br></br> 

Caller The justice thing, yeah.</br></br>
UCI: Yeah. Okay. Before ending was there anything else you wanted to add?</br></br>
Caller: No that was it. That was all.</br></br>
UCI: Okay. Thank you so much for participating in PrisonPandemic. Please consider telling your friends about us and seeing if they might call in.</br></br>
Caller: I’ll try.</br></br> 

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: I don't know really. I don't feel like they don't want to but we'll try.</br></br>
UCI. Yeah, no worries. Okay. Well, take care and we’re thinking about you out here. And we hope that the situation gets better.</br></br>
Caller: Thank you so much.</br></br>
UCI: Have a good one.</br></br>
Caller: Have a good night.</br></br>
UCI: Bye, you too.</br></br>

Caller: All right. Bye.
