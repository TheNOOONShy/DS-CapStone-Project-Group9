This story was told by a person incarcerated at John Latorraca Correctional Center.</br></br>

UCI: And what has the COVID situation been like at your facility? How has it been for you?</br></br>

Caller: In the beginning, they stuck me in the cell and I was without contact with my family or anything like that for at least a week. I mean, I wasn't able to use the phone. And, I mean, it kind of stressed me out a little bit because, I mean, the phone is the only kind of connection we have to the outside world.</br></br> 

And then, to have a little bit of comfort from my family, it wasn't there. Even though they had to put me in quarantine because I said I had a headache and stuff like that. But I mean, I always have headaches in the summer, but they weren't trying to hear that afterwards.</br></br>

So I was like, I mean - I guess, I guess for safety reasons for the staff, and I mean, I guess they figured that - I mean, that's okay. But for them not to give me phone time and stuff like that, for whatever reasons, it's - it was crazy. But after that, then they - they let me out and now I'm with the general population. Normally, I was - they still don't let us see our families.</br></br> 

I don't go to court, like, normal court. I have to do it in the video. I can't even talk to my own public defender to defend myself right now without being recorded over the phone like this.</br></br>

UCI: Wow. I'm so sorry to hear that.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah. And then there's, we can't even have visits from our family. And they're - here, in this facility, they're contactless, I mean they're behind the glass visits, regardless. I mean, there's no contact visits and we still can't get them.</br></br>

So, it's been kind of, you know what I mean? It's been kind of hard. And they say they offer us one free phone call every Monday for like five minutes, and half the time it cuts off.</br></br>

And I mean, sometimes Monday is not the day I need to talk to my family. It's Tuesday after court or something, and to get their insight and to help me do my time a little bit better. That way, it gives me a little bit of ease,I mean, knowing that I have my family's support. But I can't get that.</br></br>

To get that money or something, this county has to be able to do something. Or should I say, the county needs more funding for them to provide us - like, other neighboring counties, they have, like, Zoom or some other, I don't know what the hell they are.</br></br>

GTL and stuff like that where it's all video visits, but they still get to see their loved ones. And this county, we're - we're just trying to get, you know, one visit a week would be enough. And we just - I mean, I'm trying to file some paperwork to maybe throw some suggestions in. I mean, it takes a month just for them to answer you, sometimes.</br></br>

I understand that sometimes because, I mean, I know I'm not the priority over the whole facility, one person. So, that's where I'm at right now. And even though I'm fighting a case right now, I have no idea what's going on. And nothing like that, because my lawyer won't come see me over here. So, that's kind of where I'm at right now.</br></br>

UCI: No, you are just as important as someone else. You do deserve to know what's happening in your facility.</br></br>

Caller: So, I mean, I could call - I could call my lawyer told me to call him over the phones. They're recorded. But where my confidential, you know, my rights with me and my lawyer when these phones are recorded and listening? They might say, "Well, we didn't listen." They're listening no matter what. They have to for security reasons.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, I'm - I'm so sorry to hear that. Do you think if you were able to see your loved ones more, would - do you think it would have helped coping with the crisis? Or how have you been coping with the crisis?</br></br>

Caller: Well, everything is over the phone. And my family - I have six kids. I just had a baby girl. And I'm not blaming the county or anybody for why I'm in here.</br></br> 

It's my fault for whatever I'm in here for, right? And that's fine. And well it's a little hard because my wife wants to come see me, and I mean, it's tough on her because she has to take care of all the kids and do everything that I was doing before I came in.</br></br>

And it's - it's real hard because just seeing her would be nice. You know, see her, you know, smile or something like that. It would put me at ease and relaxing me, instead of having me all stressed out. And not worrying, you know what I mean, it's bad enough that I can't see my family.</br></br>

Now I can't see my lawyer. I mean, they just have us boxed in a little cage. I mean, they don't treat us bad or anything like that. We get our food, we get to eat, we get our canteen.</br></br>

But we just have no contact with the outside world, really, except for these phone calls but - and they give you that one five-minute phone call. Man, there's some people that don't have money and they don't have the opportunity or the luxury to be calling whenever they need to.</br></br> 

And I think that - I mean, at least imagine what they're going through. At least my wife is, I've been blessed that, you know, God gave me - gave us a little bit extra change so I could put it on the phone. To talk to her at least, I put like a dollar a day sometimes, just to say, "I love you and good morning."</br></br>

That way, we could have some type of, you know, contact that we usually have. But I mean, there's a lot of people in here that don't have that. It's - it can be real stressful, especially when some people are looking at five, six years. And they can't even get, you know, "Hi, Mom," or, "How are you doing?"</br></br> 

Or their family. And their family be able to, you know, just don't have money to put money on the phones. But they could come visit them. But they can't now. They can't even do that.</br></br>

UCI: Has your facility offered any sort of protection, like a mask or a glass window, to at least see family?</br></br>

Caller: That's what kind of visits are here, it's behind the glass. It's been like that before the, before the - before the epidemic hit. It's always been like that, behind the glass, because whatever reasons the facility has. There's no contact visits here.</br></br>

UCI: Do you think if your facility allowed a contact visit it would have made the situation better?</br></br>

Caller: Just a visit, period, even through Zoom would be fine. Just to be able to see your loved ones and talk to them more than like, you know, a couple minutes and that's it. I mean, there's a lot of things that you need to talk to them about.</br></br> 

Oh, what's going on in the streets and what's going on with your kids. You know, are they okay? And especially now that all those orders that came out with the president that he started yesterday, and the mandatory shots. I mean, it's crazy, depending on your beliefs in life.</br></br>

Either it's good or bad. But at the same time, you don't know what's going on in the streets with your family, if they're doing it, going against what you believe. Or they're going with you or they're not, I mean, you don't even know. I mean, now they're saying that in LA County, that it's mandatory for anybody 12 and older to go into school, to get the shot.</br></br>

That's - I think that's kind of insane for them to get an education, if they have to take the shot just to get their education. That's crazy. I have - I have kids that go from high school all the way to elementary school.</br></br>

UCI: And speaking of the shots, how has the vaccination situation been like for you at your facility?</br></br>

Caller: Oh, they're - they're offering it to anybody that wanted it, freely. They're - they're good for it. I mean, I won't say good for it, but they have offered it to everybody in this facility equally.</br></br>

UCI: I - I do agree with you. This is, we're in a pandemic and just being able to see your loved ones is so important. And I'm so sorry that your facility is lacking in that.</br></br>

Caller: So, I mean, I'm trying to do everything the right way through, you know, asking, the grievances and I have to wait for the process. And sometimes, it's a long process. Like I said, it's like months before they get a hold of you.</br></br>

And then just to go to the next level, and then to the next level. And by then, you know, that's two, three months that went by just for them to give you the runaround sometimes. Because, not so much because they're -</br></br>

I don't know if their hands are tied up because of what their bosses are telling them or what's going on. I mean they're, I asked for paperwork and nobody wants, they just give me the runaround sometimes. But again, I only asked verbally, so now I want to, we're actually, like, put paperwork in and request under, what's it called?</br></br>

Their - their protocol for visits and why haven't they given it to us? They - they were supposed to, we were supposed to get visits, like, maybe three months ago. They postponed it and they keep on postponing it.</br></br>

They're supposed to get them this month and they postponed it. And but that's what they're saying. They're not saying why, or who, what, where. Or how long the - the postponement is.</br></br>

I mean, they leave us in here without really knowing anything. It's terrifying. I think if they would just keep us in, like you know, informed on what's going on, on stuff that pertains to us, it would be perfect to us. Because, I mean so, I mean it would - it would help a lot of people.</br></br>

UCI: I agree, it would help a lot of people. I'm with you on that one.</br></br>

Caller: So, I mean, this facility is a good facility, like, to be housed. They put you where you need to be put.</br></br> 

And, I mean, they put the squares with the squares. They put the violent people with the violent people. However you want to put it.</br></br>

I mean, and then the COs and all that, they all, they don't mistreat you or anything like that, anytime. You know, they do their jobs and everything like that. It's the - it's the visits, I think it's unfair for them to take our visits like that.</br></br>

Especially, like, right now that everything is up and running. Banks, schools, gas stations, grocery stores, everything is running. But why can't we get our visits back?</br></br>

UCI: That is very true. I agree with - I agree with you.</br></br>

Caller: I mean, I asked one CO verbally and he said, "Oh, it's more work than if they go - if they go to - we might get the COVID from somebody that comes in." I'm like, "Don't you guys go to the same grocery stores, get the same gas? Don't you guys go to the, you know, the same car dealerships? You guys drive down the same streets. The same stop signs, I mean, as the people that would come visit us. What's the difference?"</br></br>

It's not like we're gonna keep - we're not gonna get in contact with the people from the outside. There's no way. It's apparent glass. It's apparent glass. There's no way that we could get any kind of contact with them.</br></br>

UCI: Would you say that's like a core problem of what your facility is doing wrong?</br></br>

Caller: What?</br></br>

UCI: Do you think that's what your facility is doing really bad - poor at, just lack of visitation?</br></br>

Caller: To be honest with you, yes. Because everything else, I mean, you eat your three meals a day, you get them on time. There's never anything like that. When you go to the store, you get your phones, everything like that.</br></br>

It's fine. Everything else, the COs are respectful and you know, everything. They still have programs in here and stuff that - everything, I think it's fine to what we have coming.</br></br>

Everything that we should have coming, we have coming from this facility. Except for the visits. I still think that's junky interest from here.</br></br> 

Because, I mean, why deny us our visits when nobody - I mean, I could understand if we, like, was violent or beat up somebody or we're in a disciplinary procedure. But we're not. Nobody in here is really doing nothing.</br></br>

You don't even see fights in here no more that much. And it's based on person to person now, it's not, you know, whole facility lockdown or - no, it's not like that no more. This facility is actually a good facility to do time in because it's calmed down a lot.</br></br>

They have surveillance cameras here and everything like that, so if something does happen, I mean, it's not an hour later when they find out. It's immediate response here now, so I think that's good. Because there's cameras in every dorm.</br></br>

But it's - I mean, visits is what I'm - what I'm concerned about because they're facilitated - and they're facilitated to come and use everything, to - to come see us without contact. And you're just talking with, pick up a phone and put in our inmate number just to talk to visits. So, I mean they're - we're recorded. So, I don't see what the problem is.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah. Thank you for sharing that. I do agree, that's a big concern to not allow visits.</br></br>

Caller: So, I mean, other than that, I mean - that's it then. Thank you for listening. I guess.</br></br>

UCI: No, thank you very much - than you very much for calling and sharing your experience.</br></br>

Caller: Okay, no problem.</br></br>

UCI: Thank you so much and I hope you have a good evening.</br></br>

Caller: You, too. You have a good day then. God bless you.</br></br>

UCI: Bye-bye. Thank you so much. Goodbye.</br></br>

Caller: Bye.
