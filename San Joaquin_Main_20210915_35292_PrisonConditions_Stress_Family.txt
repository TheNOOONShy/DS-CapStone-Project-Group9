This story was told by an incarcerated individual at San Joaquin County Jail.</br></br>

Caller: I call this one [redacted]. And I just finished it just last six pages in the last hour or so, so hopefully I didn't have a chance to read them over. Hopefully they're written well and can read through it easy, but, okay, here we go. I call this [redacted]. I would like to tell you a quick story about the man I was when I first came to jail, how things have changed for me, and the man I am today.</br></br>

The man that re-entered this jail two and a half months ago was tired. He was tired and rigid from the hardships and strain of the last year and a half as – oh, I'm sorry. The man that re-entered this jail two and a half months ago, he was tired and rigid from the hardships and strain that this last year and a half has been for all of us I'm sure.</br></br>

Sometimes I feel that it's the children that have suffered the most. It's those times when they're – when they're young that are so vital and important to their development I often wonder if it's the socializing and the human interaction that is – that is the most vital of all things for us in building character and being able to appreciate this life for what it's worth as my babies were forced to be without it for almost two years.</br></br>

It has been so, so hard for me to watch them go through the last two years and all that they've been forced to endure due to my struggles. By going through their worst relationships one could ever know, with the constantly drawing my attention away from my children which was something new for both me and my kids as they have always been the center of my attention.</br></br>

But I somehow allowed for this situation to get the better of me. And then added to the – and then added to that was strain of being now a single parent father as their mother, true to form, took this opportunity – took this – took this as an opportunity just go worry about nothing more than herself which is why – which is how it always was and is why I had to leave her.</br></br>

I'll tell you, I'd say I'd be lying if I – if I didn't tell you how hard it is for me to keep things the way it should be for these kids. [unintelligible] I've been scraping by as a bit of a failure. I mean, it's not easy. It's not easy at all right now being me.</br></br>

I [unintelligible] desperately need to find this life partner and soulmate I've [unintelligible] somewhere out there - there has to be this woman for me. There has to be [unintelligible] in my situation and just give a shit, especially with all I have to offer [unintelligible] maintain such a heavy stream of income allowing for us to have whatever we want when we want it and do whatever we want when we want with the proper planning and scheduling, of course. But that's normal.</br></br>

But I got to tell you, between trying to stay on top of their virtual schooling and on Skype and homework are the occasional slash now full-time getting them all to and from school combined with me owning and operating my own construction business, all these deadlines of having ten jobs going at a time, while just making sure I pay all the bills and having – having forgotten something.</br></br>

Then there's all the cooking and grocery shopping [unintelligible] cats and dogs and still have time for some good parenting with also being able to tuck them in at night, I tell you, [unintelligible] like no matter how hard I try I [unintelligible] and then I just feel like a big failure and I hate it.
