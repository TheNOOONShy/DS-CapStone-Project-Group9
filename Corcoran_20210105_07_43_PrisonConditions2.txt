This story was told by a person incarcerated at Corcoran.</br></br>

UCI: Okay. How has COVID been handled at your facility? So, could you do like a quick rundown of this, like for example if you tested positive, what happens to you after that?</br></br>

Caller: When you test positive, they send you to B yard, which is the quarantine yard. And you do stay over there for like, seven to 14 days, which you then will be returned back over here. But it seems like these COs aren't doing their job because they're not giving us the right cleaning utility that we're supposed to be having for this COVID stuff.</br></br>

Because at first they were giving us all of this cleaning stuff. But I'm actually a worker and I will be the one doing national cleaning. But lately, they haven't given us the right cleaning stuff to work. Everything's pretty much germed up.</br></br>

And the masks, I know we're supposed to be getting new masks, like every day because we're workers and each mask gets dirty and sweaty. And we're pretty much getting, I'm telling you, from like four to five days if that.
