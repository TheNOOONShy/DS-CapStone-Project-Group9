This story was told by a person incarcerated at Solano.</br></br>Caller: Right now there are mice, vermin, and insects in the gym. They’re running. They’ve reactivated the gyms, so this is in violation of a court order. So, we have, we’re finding mice droppings. And what I was going to do, I was going to collect some of the samples, and hold on to them. I was going to give them to the sergeant and show her. Because-</br></br>  UCI: Mhmm.</br></br>   Caller: She was like, very reluctant to believe that we have mice in here. And then there’re vermin, there’re big super-sized cockroaches that are running around. I don’t know- </br></br>  UCI: Oh.</br></br>  Caller: -what species they are, but they’re huge, huge cockroaches. And there’s mice running around literally eating people’s food that’s on the floor. They’re making us store all of our stuff on the floor. They have a small, they have a small container we can dump stuff in, but most guys have accumulated, you know, a lot of personal stuff. And, you know, our food and the canteen items that we get are, kind of, exposed to the mice, to rats, to whatever vermin that gets under the door because there’s no insulation under the door. There’s like an inch gap under the door that leads from outside into the gym, and the field mice come in and have their way with it.</br></br>
