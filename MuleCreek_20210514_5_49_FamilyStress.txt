This story was told by a person incarcerated at Mule Creek.</br></br>

UCI: Perfect. The time is 5:49. The date is May 14, 2021.</br></br>

Caller: Okay. Do I start?</br></br>

UCI: Yes.</br></br>

Caller: Oh okay. Ah excuse me. Okay. To begin with, right now I thank God very much because I have already gone through this experience, which was very horrible. And I never thought that this could reach me. And I got very sick.</br></br>

They had to quarantine me. And well I was hospitalized for about 15 days and well thank God, as I already said, because He helped me to overcome all of this. And well I had a bit of a bad time. Later when I came out of that I went back to where I live.</br></br> 

And well I spoke to my family and it turned out that my relative too, two died from that. And that made me a little sad. A little depressed. Because my mom and brother died because of that too.</br></br> 

And well I want everyone to know that they are not alone. That there are people who are always looking out for everyone, out there. Like this organization of yours. Who care about you and want to know what your experience has been through this situation.</br></br> 

And all I can say is to keep going, God is going to help us and God is going to get us through this. The relatives that we have lost, are gone. There’s no way to see them again, to change what happened. But I know that like me, many have lost relatives.</br></br>

Their fathers, their mothers, their siblings and it has been surprising because it was not something we expected. Suddenly this came and ended many lives. But hopefully this helps us to become aware and value ourselves and love our families more. Tell them how much we love them, how important family members are to us.</br></br>

 Because when you're out there free, you don't pay much attention to your family. No one says I love you. Dads, moms go to work, and you don't tell them anything. Good luck, or a kiss, a hug.</br></br> 

And when you least expect it a situation like this happens, suddenly they get sick and then you can’t see them. Because of the pandemic you can't visit anyone because you might get sick too. And that's what I want to say. To keep going, that there is a God who will always help us and who will always move us forward.</br></br> 

And many thanks to your organization for trying to look out for us. And it helps many, for you to hear the testimonies that one has here. There are things, more things that I would like to tell you, but I am going to write you a letter so that you can also read my letter and if you want to publish it, that's fine too. Thank you very much for letting me speak these words and I hope they help you much more.</br></br>

And that you keep going. God is going to help us and get us out of this.
