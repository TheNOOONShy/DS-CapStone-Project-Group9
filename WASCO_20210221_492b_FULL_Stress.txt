Hello PrisonPandemic Project,</br></br>
Konnichiwa is good day. It’s in Japanese. I’m not a native speaker but I have Japanese material to learn and a burning desire to learn another language. And I chose Japanese because I like anime!</br></br>
I won’t be empty-handed when I leave prison. I plan to learn Japanese and understand Arabic. I’m also Muslim. A convert.</br></br>
Being locked-down for 20 hours to 23 isn’t a handicap at all. I have a bunkie, and he reads to me three to seven hours out loud to me. He finished On your Knees Camron Bridge by Meredith Wild. It’s a romance with a juicy plot!</br></br>
Even though I’m locked up I feel like I’m looking through a kaleidoscope. Everything it’s vivid and sometimes dark but it’s bright and colorful most days. I’m not to say I’m living luxury but through a microscopic view I found peace within myself and God. Allah in Arabic means God!</br></br>
Always moderate and networking with other inmates. We try to reach nirvana through our ordeals. I'll be leaving to main line soon. I’ll catch up with you soon. Shitsurei is good bye or excuse me.</br></br>
Here's my cellmate info. You can write him and ask about the pandemic. He was here a year.
