This letter was written by a person incarcerated at OC_Lacy.</br></br>First and for most thank you for reaching out to us as inmates. My name is [redacted]. Life behind these walls are crazy, scary, and a waste of time. I have been coming to jail and prison all my life. And never have I experienced a time like this during a crisis. COVID-19. As of right now we get no visits, no hot meals, and we are housed with people who have been tested with COVID who are positive. Its scary to know that! My celly can be tested in here for COVID-19, and come back positive and I remain living with this person.</br></br> Two months ago, judge Pete Wilson of the Superior Court ordered sheriff Don Barnes to release inmates due to COVID-19, cause jails are packed to slow the spread of COVID, and that wasn’t met. Don Barnes appealed it and lost. For a man in Don Barnes’ position if you were asked by a (superior) honorable judge- who sits in a seat at the judicial system table, you would do as asked for the safety of the inmates right off the bat. Don Barnes, appealed it, that shows me as an inmate, that Don Barnes doesn’t give two shits about us as inmates and doesn’t care about his position at the table of being head of the table for the Orange County sheriff’s department.</br></br>As for your question; (how does it feel during this time being in here) it’s scary. It’s caused me (ptsd) constantly in fear of it. Ima get COVID-19 due to being housed with inmates who have caught COVID – and Don Barnes does nothing to help the problem. I’m stressed out , all the time, we get sack meals all day for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. The 2,000 diet calorie it’s not even met, we are malnourished. Not eating healthy, so many of our Constitutional rights are being violated and its hard for us to do anything cause the moment we seek help, the sheriffs and their crew harass the fuck out of us and break more of our Constitutional rights to keep our mouths shut.</br></br>Excuse my language but Ima give it to you, raw, and 100% how it is. No icing on the cake. As for me I’m a really intelligent inmate I have morals of life. I work at [redacted] in Tustin, I’m a father of my 14 year old son. I’m not a monster, that society judges by the book cover that everyone looks at in the wrong way just cause I have shiny bracelets on as cuffs.</br></br>I wanna get off parole. I wanna open some businesses, I have a high school diploma, I have two years ex at college for business, I know how to produce music, DJ, rap, I work on cars customizing from hydraulics, to audio systems, brakes, suspension, paint, auto body, engines. I worked construction, framing, tiling, concrete, stucco, demolition. I’ve learned all these traits from my dad a handy man who works for [redacted] school district. I’m not a monster if I had the right to help instead of jail time I can go somewhere in life. Due to how the system is created its made like a merry go round, round and round up and down. I’m (dizzy) already.</br></br>Being on parole and probation doesn’t help if you make one wrong mistake you get locked right back up without inmates cops, and sheriffs have no jobs. So much crooked things happen in here to inmates its sad, the only difference that is different them from us is the uniform they wear. And the badge which they hide behind to cover their own asses.</br></br>I have not being doing good my (ptsd) doesn’t let me rest. I’m scared of this COVID its no joke, no visits, no one to talk to, there’s no programs here due to COVID- no school. We are stuck in a cell 22 hours a day. The only time we come out if for a day room other than that we’re like dogs in a kennel. I got (ptsd) due to being in jail this time due to COVID, being stressed out, can’t sleep not knowing if I have COVID. Or is my celly who just got tested and came back (+) gonna give it to me. We fill out grievances, and no looks at them or does anything about it.</br></br>I feel that when we address the sergeant with a complaint the sheriffs just shred our paperwork cause without paperwork there’s no paper trail. Paper trail matters big time, I’m not the only inmate suffering in here; there’s a lot of us who are dealing with the same conflicts. I will be calling also so this will be on record. I don’t know if they read thus letter they might make it disappear and it might not reach you, but if it does I hope I painted a pretty pic for you.</br></br>I’m being (sarcastic) LOL sorry but I wanna thank you for your time and your effort for reaching out to us, maybe this will make some difference. But I stand tall for my rights, that are being violated when they should be respected, for one nation under liberty and justice for all, Thank you.
