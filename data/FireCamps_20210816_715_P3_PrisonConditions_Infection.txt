This story was told by a person incarcerated at Fire Camp.</br></br>  

Caller: Now, what's interesting to me is, you know for a fact that we're men, and we haven't female contact or male contact for that matter, for -- you know it is 2021, and everything's just a free for all.</br></br> 

UCI: Right.</br></br> 

Caller: So, there's organic urges that we have.</br></br> 

UCI: Yep. I got you.</br></br> 

Caller: I say this conservatively and respectfully, beauty is in the eye of the beholder. I believe it was Edgar Allen Poe that said, "For what is a rose in a field of onions but a weed?" But they -- today when the nurse showed up, she happened to be gorgeous, okay?</br></br> 

After they give the COVID test, they're offering that vaccine; you know what I mean? I noticed this at North Kern State Prison. I noticed this at Jamestown Conservation Center or Sierra Conservation Center. They will have the pretty nurses running around and offering the vaccine.</br></br> 

UCI: That's hilarious.</br></br> 

Caller: And most of these guys are like, "Oh, you know, she's beautiful. Look she's very voluptuous, and all her curves are in the right spot. We'll literally, we'll fall down and do anything for a little bit of attention."</br></br> 

I'm sitting there going; this is such a trap because it's the age-old temptation. You send a beautiful woman, you know, we're going to lust after that, and the answer is gonna be, "Yes, I will take the vaccine."</br></br> 

They've gone as far as to tell these nurses and nurse practitioners, I've learned about a nurse practitioner also, which basically means you are not a doctor, and from this point forward, the answer is no to any type of treatment you're offering me, in my opinion. They went as far as to tell them to notify us that if we do not take the vaccine, especially at North Kern State Prison, which is a reception center, if you don't take the vaccine, it will slow down your ability to mainline, which is as far as I'm concerned, a criminal threat.</br></br> 

Because the benefits that come with mainlining is you get the percentage dropped, which is something I don't understand. Imma to cascade there for a moment so people understand. When you're sentenced -- let's say you get sentenced to four years with half-time.</br></br>

You get sent from county jail to the reception center, and then once you hit the reception center, they find out where you're gonna go, which takes about three to four months, then you get sent over there, and then you see committee. Once you see committee, you get your percentage dropped. So, let's say I was sentenced to four years with half, that means I have to do two years.</br></br> 

Well, all of the sudden, when I hit committee at the mainline facility, they drop my time to 1/3 time. So, now, on a four-year sentence, I'm only gonna actually do 16 months.</br></br> 

UCI: Wow.</br></br> 

Caller: That means I'm extremely motivated to be transferred. So, when someone comes and tells me, "Hey, Mr. Blank, you're not going to be able to get out of here unless you take this vaccine," guess what I'm gonna do?</br></br> 

UCI: You're gonna take the vaccine.</br></br> 

Caller: Well, I sure as hell didn't. I was like, "Hell no, I'm not taking that vaccine." But most of the people around me did.</br></br> 

UCI: God damn! It's a trap. Wait, that's crazy, though. The implications? That is insane.</br></br> 

Caller: Yeah, it's coercion. It's coercion because literally what they're saying is if you want to go and get your percentage dropped, you need to take this vaccine, and if you don't take this vaccine, you're going to be sitting here only getting your 50 percent time.
