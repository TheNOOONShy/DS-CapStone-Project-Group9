This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Donovan.</br></br>Moving on to the next question again, “How have you been coping with this crisis?” My way of coping with the crisis was by staying mindful of my surroundings and the pandemic situation, praying for myself and others aboard, reading books, listen to music (Jazz particularly), exercising, writing letters, and repairing various things for needy inmates. Which I truly enjoy doing in my leisure time.</br></br>Lastly, the question about “what has it been like to be inside during this time?” This question asked was actually the second question, but I chose to answer it last because my consequences resulted to imprisonment. I accept personal responsibility for my unlawful committed crimes. At the time I committed robbery crimes, I was a angry, resentful, selfish, impulsive, immature individual. However, because of addresses issues, and self development maturity growth, I am a changed person today who has experienced remorse, empathy and compassion for the first time since my October ‘98 incarceration.</br></br>Although, I have a lengthy sentence that was appropriate, due to the crime and emotional trauma that I caused the various victims to experience on those crime dates and thereafter. I am truly sorry for my behavior of unlawfulness and truly wish that I was able to take those (p.t.s.d) memories away from a far. Yet, I realize that this is “wishful thinking,” I desperately continue to make direct, indirect and living amends by writing remorse letters, paying my restitution to the victims and being in service to others.</br></br>Since the pandemic world outbreak, I had become afraid of the inevitable as I continue to watch various news stations reporting the news stories about the people who are infected and the nations death toll across our country. I had rapid racing thoughts that flooded my mind one after another that had scared me more and more to a emotional state at times. But then, I would remember my late mother’s soft voice saying son “whatever problem that is bothering you, turn to God because he is a hearer of prayers and a great comforter. No one will truly know what you are going through, but he will son.”</br></br>Raising from my knees after praying, I no longer felt scared or worried about dying or leaving behind my three family siblings to deal with this unmerciful pandemic situation alone. The power of prayer is just that, powerful!! I realize, that I cannot change my circumstances, but I can change my subconscious thoughts that caused unpleasant and unhelpful feelings. Also, I realize that I have the will, the strength and the inner power to move my life forward by not worrying, and releasing my past wrongs, because “who I am, is no longer what I did and what I did is who I am.” Meaning a criminal who was callous.</br></br> However, I strongly believe that nothing is more important at this point then to have a personal spiritual communication with our creator. This is not an area to debate our belief or lack of belief in our creator; it’s where we gain trust and faith in knowing that he heard our prayers as we wait patiently for a response.</br></br>I feel, that the only best way that I can help the world society and my inside prison community is by continuing to pray for people, and being a caring good listener for someone who need to talk. I value human life now, and the toll amount of people that we had lost because of this pandemic is troubling grasp as well as the constant killings of American citizens.</br></br>Yet, I am very grateful for the created vaccine, the health workers and other Americans who are helping to stop the spread of the virus as well as the government assists aid.</br></br> With that, let me just say, I now realize, life was not meant to be all smiles and laughter on this planet called Earth. Life is full of teaching moments and opportunities to learn. Life without problems and challenges would create strengthless people I believe. If we didn’t have bad problems, then we couldn’t enjoy the good learning experiences.</br></br>
