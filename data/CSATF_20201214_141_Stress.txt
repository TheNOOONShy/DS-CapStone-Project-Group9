This pandemic is huge and having a sentence like me doing all of the above to show change and this COVID-19, it’s really stressful because catching it and not being able to show courts, family, myself the desires to show everyone how taking life serious has made a definite impact on me. Lost loved ones. I became the gentleman they all prayed for. So it’s definitely an experience. You’re fighting for your life through courts and rehabilitation, and fighting to stay alive with this COVID-19 to make it back home.
