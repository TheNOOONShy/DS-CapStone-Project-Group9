I been going through a rough time. I’m not getting any mail or phone calls. I got sick and nothing’s change.</br></br>   They been giving us the same food cold. Still movin' people around like CMC ain’t place with the most cases right now with the COVID-19 family issues. I just needed someone to talk with about what’s going on in here. It’s hectic. People are still catching this shh? Even with the shot.</br></br>   Sorry about my handwriting. I’m tryna deal with a family matter that’s buggin me. I’m tryna not to let dictate my program. I been watching gospel channel. Hope that helps me get through this rough time.</br></br>   My mind’s all over the place. I’m tryna write down my thoughts. Oh yeah, a few people I know, but no names, die from the COVID-19. And they keep sayin “it’s nothing it’s gone go away” but they keep bringing it to us. What you call that. Hope to hear from you soon.</br></br>   Thank you with a beautiful day.
