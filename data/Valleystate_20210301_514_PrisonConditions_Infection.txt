This letter was written by an individual incarcerated at Valley State. </br></br>
There was a guy next door who was kicking his door for about 30 minutes, screaming “Man down, I can't breathe!” before someone showed up to help. It was about one a.m. and to get a guards attention about ten more cells helped him by yelling and kicking doors also. </br></br>
I hurt for that man and felt scared but angry. I closed my eyes and just prayed. </br></br>
After two weeks inside that cell they test me again (quick test). Two days later they tell me to pack up, I’m moving from observation to quarantine. Now in a big cell with one other man from my original cell, I was happy I did not land in the chapel with no bathroom, shower, etc. </br></br>
I stayed in that cell for two more weeks. After not showing symptoms for some days they have us move to general population. </br></br>
I’m confronted at my new cell door by a man asking me where I came from. After telling him, he aggressively tells me that I’m not coming into that room and to go tell the C.O.’s that I’m refusing housing! This man was fearing getting sick due to the lack of information by the prisons and confusion on the news. </br></br>
Now again I’m in a state of powerlessness where I have a man aggressively (and twice my size) telling me to stay out and a C.O. telling me go in or suffer consequences. After the officer talked with the cell they allowed me in. The worst night of the COVID experience. </br></br>
I could not cough, sneeze, or anything with those men telling something crazy like I’m a plagued sick, dying person trying to get them sick. Two weeks later they start separating us again. “Positives” from those who never tested positive. </br></br>
I moved one more time since then due a pipe that broke in my room. So how can I keep myself safe when the rules for us inmates are different than the rules of our overseers the guards. </br></br>
So I have heard that things are changing for the better but still see much negligence and inconsistencies in how positive tests are being handled. We are human beings too. </br></br>
