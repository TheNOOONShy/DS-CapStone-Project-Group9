This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Wasco.</br></br>During this time of the COVID-19 pandemic life has been a little overwhelming. IÕve accounted two deaths in the family and a few more non-family members. So yes, it has been stressful. IÕve been constantly pursuing other coping mechanism instead of consuming drugs or alcohol to ease the grief. It is hard when that has been a go-to mechanism.</br></br>Every day is a struggle within these walls. The reducing of visitations from friends and loved owns has been difficult. Not been able to see your loved ones physically really tends to stress me out. Its hard knowing that your loved ones can catch this COVID-19 virus and result into death. Just the thought saddens me emotionally.</br></br>
