This story was told by a person incarcerated at New Folsom.</br></br>UCI: So how are you today?</br></br>Caller: I'm good. We just came off of quarantine today. This is the first day off.</br></br>UCI: Oh really? And so what facility are you housed at?</br></br>Caller: I'm in CSP Sac.</br></br>UCI: Okay and what has the COVID situation been like at your facility?</br></br>Caller: Yeah. It's been people catching it on and off, but see the problems that we have in here, they trying to say that my celly had it, and my celly, he tested negative for it. We got our results and they still put us, slammed us down for a month. We ain't have programs from April 14th, since April 14th.</br></br>UCI: Wow, so since people have been getting vaccinated, have they been offering the vaccine to you guys?</br></br>Caller: Yes, they offered and we already got both vaccines but that still ain't doing nothing. They still slamming us down. Like I said, this is our first day off, today. Now we got a little yard in a month.</br></br>UCI: So, before they slammed you guys down, how was the visitation and program going on?</br></br>Caller: It ain't no visitation - oh, they just started visitation. It was, it just started behind the glass but before that, man it was nothing. We didn't have groups 'cause we have mental health groups or we have self-help groups to help us go home early, they stopped all of it.</br></br>I mean they slammed us all the way down where we couldn't have no type of program. And we were just in the cell 24/7. They was hardly even giving us showers.</br></br>For the first couple weeks, they wasn't even giving us showers because they tried to blame, "Oh man we don't know what's going on. Oh, we don't know."</br></br>UCI: Wow, so how have you been coping with that?</br></br>Caller: I haven't man. I been low-key going crazy a little bit. There were times where I even had suicidal ideations man. I feel like they was not trying to help.</br></br>We have paperwork in here. We file grievances and stuff and showing that, "Hey man, we negative," and they still had us locked down. They don't care it was just, oh yeah they was enjoying it in a way.</br></br>UCI: And so, what would you say that they could do to make the situation better at your facility?</br></br>Caller: They can start giving us what we got coming. There are people in this sections waiting for packages, canteen for a month, two months for packages. I got a notice in the mail, 'cause I got a prepaid account with a package company access, saying that March 29th was when my package came in the prison and I ain't seen this yet.</br></br>They saying, "Oh they don't know where it's at." Bruh, how do you lose something that's mine? Man, now I'm starting to believe that they gave it to another inmate man, 'cause it's a whole lotta funny shit, cops roaring up on inmates, man what the hell.</br></br>UCI: Wow, and what else - go ahead, I'm sorry.</br></br>Caller: I said yeah, we got cops jumping on inmates and stuff. We got cops doing all types of foul play shit man and it's, ain't nothing we can do about it. If we fight em, we can fight them back but then they stick charges, "Oh man he hit us first," knowing that they lying.</br></br>Man, they hit you first. They literally swung first. And if there's cameras on the yard that saw it, all of a sudden they can't find the video. Knowing that the officer - so basically you facing another strike or in court looking at 25 to life because he swung first and he lying to save his ass.</br></br>

UCI: Wow.</br></br>Caller: And I know this COVID stuff been bringing stress on people. I know this COVID shit's been bringing stress on people but you got cops just jumping on inmates and stuff. And all they're doing, even if they find them at fault, the COs fault, and of course dismiss the case, all they doing is shuffling them cops around the state.</br></br>I don't know when it was the last time they fired a CO. It's been probably, it's been years probably since they did that. All they doing is, is if you got dirty corrupt COs and stuff, all they do is shuffle them around, putting them in different prisons.</br></br>And they start up doing back at what they was doing in the same prisons. Jumping on inmates and all types of shit. And this is making it worser because it's COVID-19. And it's any type of mouth foul from any inmate, then they whooping your ass.</br></br>You in the hole with fucking swollen face, broken jaw, all types of shit, and looking at pinning charges from the county of Sacramento or wherever. I did seen them jump on hella inmates. This shit foul bruh.</br></br>UCI: Man, so what else did you want the people to know about your experience there with COVID?</br></br>Caller: Do I get a copy, do I get a copy of whatever y'all finna print up or write up?</br></br> UCI: No, it'll be on the PrisonPandemic website.</br></br>Caller: The what?</br></br>UCI: It'll be on the PrisonPandemic website.</br></br>Caller: Oh, it's not like a newspaper or nothing?</br></br>UCI: No, it's a PrisonPandemic project. We create a digital archive to capture and preserve the stories of the people who are incarcerated in California prisons.</br></br>Caller: Okay, yeah I want y'all to put my name too man. I ain't tripping. I want the people to know.</br></br> UCI: It's just our protocol. We're just not allowed to release identifying information for you guys. It's just anonymous.</br></br>Caller: Y'all can't put initials?</br></br>UCI: No.</br></br>Caller: Man, that's crazy. Is that like a campus y'all work from?</br></br>UCI: Yes.</br></br>Caller: Oh, it's a college campus?</br></br> UCI: Yes.</br></br>Caller: Damn, man. Yeah, I talked to the last dude there and he told me that y'all had a, part of y'all college, y'all had a people that's practicing law man. I was saying put a good word in for us inmates up in here. Y'all could help us out.</br></br>UCI: Definitely. This is what this project is for, so everybody can hear your story.</br></br>Caller: 'Cause I know y'all can't find us legal assistance. He told me that, but I mean this is already on y'all campus so, I mean, putting a good word for a couple names that you got like myself.</br></br>Man, I mean I got evidence, I've been wrongfully accused and I can't even get to court 'cause I ain't even got a lawyer. No lawyer want to pick up on that type of stuff. Going against the cops is like going against the government, you know?</br></br>So it's like man, I'm stuck up in here with all these damn charges on me and I can't even do nothing about it because no lawyer wanna pick up on my case. If I filed a paperwork, I know I'ma lose.</br></br>UCI: Yeah, well definitely someone will hear your story and hopefully you'll get the help that you need.</br></br>Caller: All right. But yeah, that's all I got now right now. But, oh yeah, when it was bad and everybody was getting sick, they had people in the cell that was negative with positive people.</br></br>That was the one of the number one things that I did not like, because it's, man this dude is positive but he can get his celly sick. And they had us all on lockdown too, man what kind of shit is this?</br></br>UCI: Wow, so it's easily spread. But that's currently all I have today for me. I thank you very much for participating in the PrisonPandemic and please consider telling friends about us and see if they would like to call in.</br></br>Caller: Yeah, I'ma still mention and I'ma still call and let y'all know what's going on and everything so y'all know what these people are doing. I got a couple more stories I'ma have to dig up cause I filed grievances and stuff out of my cell and let y'all know what they've been doing during the pandemic.</br></br>It's like everything just got hella worse up in here. So hopefully y'all can put that on your website too man, and people can see this stuff man and see man this is foul play, stuff that's going on.</br></br>UCI: Right, we'll be looking forward to your call.</br></br>Caller: All right, thank you man. All right bye.
