This story was told by a person incarcerated at Toad Road Jail.</br></br>Caller: My concern is that we will quarantine or detach, almost, we're going to be almost a month on quarantine. And we only get 15 minutes a day of a shower. And we all get the negative. And they put some people that take the positive and put them on pills. And then they got him out of here and they already working. But now that they have a job and having quarantine we can't do anything we only can get, like I said get 15 minutes a day for the shower.</br></br>In accordance with the law, we're supposed to get an hour every day of at least, stretch your legs. We're in the cell 24 seven. And in the cell, we've got to pick up our food and come back to the cell. And we don't have actually well no visit. We only have video visit when whenever you know people can do them. Now, another thing is that my question is to you guys understanding I don't know what the purpose is you guys thing is of act to share? Or to let you guys know what's going on? I think it's not very, that you're listening to me?</br></br>UCI: Yeah, I'm listening to you.</br></br>Caller: Yeah, okay. So, my understanding is, this is not according to law, because even though we're not positive. We're not being treated by any kind of bacteria, because we already tested like I said, with just a [intelligible], me and my cellmate, we tested positive twice, but we're still on lockdown to the patch, almost, we're going to be in a month already in this kind of crap, which I think is not fair.</br></br>And, and you know what I mean? And then we can't talk to anybody, anytime we ask any question they tell us, well, you know, that's the big boss who knows what the big boss says, and we're gonna go call him to see what they say. But I know my understanding, we should get at least an hour a day, with recreation or you know, besides talking to the walls, you know, is psychologically is affecting it. Even though we're inmates, we committed a crime, which is like, whatever, you know, we got to do what we got to do, but at the same time, we cannot be treated like animals, you know what I mean?</br></br> Well, like I can say we're like criminals without papers, you know what I mean?  Besides other people that commit crimes, and they have a permit to do it. Which, you know, my understanding is we should get a least an hour a day, but it remains or you know, in a way we just we'll get our inmate rights violated by you know, just not giving us at least what we're supposed to get. Now, whether you guys can do anything about it, I don't know.</br></br>You know, I have a private lawyer and I was gonna call her lawyer see if she can call the jail and she was going on because you know. Part of my concerns and I know that you guys may get many calls or many letters so you know what I mean, but you know the jails in here is like they're very you know, we'll get our rights violated left and right you know, they do whatever they want there's nothing we can do there's nothing who we can call we can tell, Hey, you know what, can you help us, can you at least you know, don't these people give us an hour an hour break or an hour day room so we can stretch our legs and not going crazy inside them cells you know we got a two inmates inside one cell. we've got to be like, we gotta poop and fire each other like our initial like, if you know, we're not in a third world country, you know what I mean?</br></br>And, and I think it's not constitutional, it's not fair. And I know, maybe you guys, there's nothing you guys can do. Or you know what I mean? Because if what they do is when people come out, try and talk to a mate, they make a look like so good. And then when they leave, everything goes back to normal. You know what I mean? So, I was just kind of calling you guys and let you guys know, maybe you can put the story out there. And it might make a difference. It might not. You know, but that's how it goes. Nowadays show. We'll see what happens.</br></br>UCI: Yeah, definitely. Unfortunately, there's nothing we can do directly, like our program itself. But our goal is that hopefully, by posting the stories that inmates are sharing, we can get their voice heard, and hopefully somebody with power can do something about it. Yeah-</br></br>Caller: I mean, I, you know, I I'm not, I'm not, I'm not a politician, or not, but I also I, I got my education, I went to college, I became a respiratory therapist, I lost my license for some stupid thing that I did. I understand that politics to get, they can only go so far. Because it's gonna, it's gonna, it's nobody's gonna stop and help inmates, you know what I mean?</br></br>There's going to be like, what do you know, I mean, we can publish or something else, that'd be more, you know, more gaining of something extra protecting inmates for their rights, or if they get better food, or they get better treatment, or to get an hour break, or they can feel like, they really don't care. But you can. Maybe, maybe, maybe there's an angel out there or somebody but as you can put my name my number, I don't care out there. Okay. And so, somebody may be like, hey, you know, I mean, that's kind of brutal. You know what I mean? Come on, we're not in a third world country, we're like, we've got to be 24 seven.</br></br>We're not even positive. You know what I mean? That's the thing that gets to me that we're not even positive, we've been tested twice. Already got the shot in here for the vaccine. And everybody that's in here with a test, tests negative, but we're feeling locked down. We're still in lockdown that will give us 10 minutes to take a shower.</br></br>And we can't even stop in the next cell, say something because they're screaming at us from the tower, to say get you a button on the door, got to take a shower and come back to your cell, you know, like, come on, you know, it's crazy. I understand. Like I said, again, I understand there's nothing you can do. And there's nothing that you guys can do just post it out there.</br></br>Maybe somebody would change things, but I think it's embarrassing for, you know, for politics and for everybody not to care about even though we're not you know, when they're when I'm not in none of us in here are murderers and killers and, and rapers, you know, we'll just, you know, paint your life I have a you know, everybody has a different life and, and, and, you know, I have you know, I just had a son passed away in a motorcycle accident not too long ago. And the thing is I have the video of my son dying and I watched a video for six months getting drunk and high. And I know everybody grieves things in different ways. We're not everybody perfect, everybody not strong enough to, to, you know, overcome something like that. But you know, my sister had a kid that passed away in 1979 and was three years old. And current grandpa run him over with a truck and but so, life goes sideways for some people, you know what I mean?</br></br>But like I said, I'm not trying to make an excuse for my behaviors. And but I think it's what we're going through is very unfair, you know, not just for me speaking for me and everybody else in here. That way, just, you know, in the cell, and the thing is they have a day room and they have people in the day room they can walk freely back and forth. But they have all the rest of us here  on the cell. We got to shit in here, piss in here, workout in here and if we do want to exercise you got birdbath inside of here because they wouldn't let us out to take another shower. I apologize for my words, but it gets me aggravated. But anyways, I thought I will tell you this and you can put my name, I don't care. But just another story for you guys.</br></br>But anyways, that's all I need to tell you, and thank you for listening to me and we'll see what happens. Alright.</br></br>UCI: Okay, thank you so much for calling if you have any other COVID stories you want to share in the future or if anybody who's, who's in quarantine with you wants to call they can also call and share their stories. Thank you so much for calling again.</br></br>Caller: Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Well, you know my crime is very one of the smallest crimes in the book. So, I'll be out soon. What I'm gonna do is I'm gonna see if I can make my story and everybody else's story and talk about this. Maybe more to the public. Maybe somebody will say, hey, we can do something. Maybe, maybe not. Maybe get nothing. You know. The only thing we're gonna do is pray and hope. And thank you very much and you have a wonderful night.</br></br>UCI: Thank you too. Bye-bye.</br></br>Caller: Bye-bye.
