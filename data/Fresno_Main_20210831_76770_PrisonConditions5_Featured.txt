This story was told by a person incarcerated at Fresno County Jail.</br></br>

Caller: I wrote the grievance already. I went through the process of the grievance. They denied it, talking about their policy, they haven't done nothing wrong. Well I'm not concerned about what you did wrong. What have you done right?</br></br> 

That's my question. What have you done right to keep me from being re-exposed six times since the pandemic started to COVID-19 and I've been in the jail for over four years? I can't re-expose myself. When I leave the housing - when I leave the housing unit, I have my mask on.</br></br> 

You know what I mean? I go through protocols that the government has set up. You know what I mean? When I leave my housing unit, I have my mask on. When I go to court, I have my mask on. We have virtual court, but yet they're stopping our courts. What's the purpose of virtual court?</br></br>

I've been sitting in the courtroom, and I've seen a guy, in court, that's in Wasco State Prison. So, if you can give that guy - protect his rights of going to court, and he's in Wasco State Prison, and he's going to court in Fresno County Jail virtual, why can't you do that to inmates that you place on COVID-19 lockdown in Fresno County Jail?
