To PrisonPandemic,</br></br>

To whom it may concern, hi! I'm incarcerated here at Soledad State Prison, been here for the past seven years. I've been listening to all information on how COVID-19 was transmitted so rapidly into our facility. I listened to the warden on the subject of some post doctrine people from UC Berkeley who are specialists on COVID-19 spread.</br></br>

We’re perplexed on how this virus transmitted since we have no open cells and that they found no fault on CTS’s procedures and protocols.</br></br>

I'm here to tell you that the warden and post doctrine people have never been behind closed doors of our living area. Being in a cell with no ventilation and only windows that pop up into a certain degree is not ventilation. Especially in cold climate weather where you have to keep the windows closed.</br></br> 

Our cell doors suck and are as well as pushing air out through the door frame of our doors. Not only this was a problem, but so was a lot of other negligent things that occurred. I have written a more extensive view of my common sense opinion to the legal office in San Quentin Prison, to [redacted].</br></br> 

Please contact him or he might contact UC Berkeley because I had asked him to forward a copy of my letter to the proper investigators.</br></br>

Note: Procedures and protocols are good in writing, but fail if not followed. Daily announcements do not work if not enforced. Patiently await your response.</br></br>

Sincerely.
