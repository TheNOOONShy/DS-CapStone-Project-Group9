Hi PrisonPandemic team,</br></br>

I hope I found you and your best of health. I received your letter. You are definitely right, we've all come across difficult times. I even lost my girlfriend over the COVID-19 virus.</br></br>

I'm hurt really bad as a result, and I'm single looking for a girlfriend or if you know anyone single please let me know I just need somebody. Man has got to be strong and that's what I've been doing staying strong through it all because I can't let myself down.</br></br>

We are now on lockdown for weapons. It's a lot of drama in prison fights/stabbings it hasn't been easy but I got it like you say what it takes to get you through it. I'm feeling really good to know that you are thinking about me and I hope we can become friends, and if not as a girlfriend at least let me be your friend.</br></br>

I would like to get to know you personally. I would like to know what you're taking up in college if you're part of a team or other stories and stuff like that. I would love to give all the stories you need, I have a ton.</br></br>

At this state prison where I saw officers let inmate prisoners get jumped by six prisoners. I was jumped by three prisoner inmates. I held my own though I beat all three of them and held my own but the officers just watched and did not push the alarm.</br></br>

I'm now here in New Folsom because I caught a battery charge on a prisoner in another facility. I also had a knife charge on me. A false charge put me in the hole that locked me up at New Folsom.</br></br>
 
Threatened by seven officers on my time here but I did not bite, because I'm still trying to get out of prison. I already have three assault on officer charges. I got a board hearing next month to be released.</br></br>

I really just need support from my family and friends at this time. If they give me a release date, have a place to stay or get a job or when I'm out of here. I should get a release date soon, it's difficult not getting any visitation time for family and loved ones. It's really been really hard on me.</br></br> 

As for vaccinations, it's been going slow on the facility. They really need more medical supplies and help.</br></br>

Can I call you over telephone whenever I can, I really would like to get to know you. We can talk about anything you want to talk about, me or relationships corresponding to my mail or telephone. I'm here to give you any story you need.</br></br>

How is going to college, how have you been doing in college? I hope well and good because you deserve the best in life help. I hope life has been treating you good. I hope you're staying strong. COVID has really made these very hard times.</br></br>

But I just want to let you know that I believe in you, I want you to know that, because I care and want the best for you guys. I hope to hear from you, would mean a lot to me. Take care of yourselves.
