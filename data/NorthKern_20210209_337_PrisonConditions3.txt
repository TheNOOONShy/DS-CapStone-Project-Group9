This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Delano.</br></br>
 
This pandemic and the flu season was and still is, a double-edged sword. This one guy when he came out of his cell for vitals, fell face first to the floor, then put him back into his cell. When guys come into contact with staff that tested positive for COVID or tested positive for COVID, they were sent to facility B or D for quarantine.</br></br>

After two weeks and a negative test, they would come back to facility A, sometimes a guy would be rehoused in building 2 or 4, the now effected buildings, doesnâ€™t that put others at risk of infection?
