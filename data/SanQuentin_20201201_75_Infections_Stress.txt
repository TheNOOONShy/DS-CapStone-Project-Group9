This letter was written by a person incarcerated at San Quentin.</br></br>

On June 23rd, 2020, my harrowing ordeal began. I tested positive for the Corona Virus 2019. On June 25, I was moved to an isolation cell in the prisons hole. A place where men who have violated prison rules are segregated from the population.</br></br>

Once in that cell alone, the all too familiar feelings of impending death seized upon me once again. It was the 26th year to my incarceration [Redacted]. I sat alone in that cell with fear as my only companion.</br></br>

All I could do was think “not again” and cry and beg whatever spiritual deity that was listening to spare me. I thought about all the progress I had made and the roads I had travelled. I thought of my blessings.</br></br>

My recent marriage. My beautiful, strong, independent wife, my soulmate, and newfound family. Would I lose it all before I even had a chance to enjoy it? I was caged at such a young age I never got the chance to taste the fullness of life through offspring.</br></br>

My only thoughts – Would this all end here and now? No one would know the terror and demons I faced in that cage. I kept it all hidden from those who loved me most. One of us suffering was enough.</br></br>

I remember that first night and how my breath grew shallow, and I struggled to get air into my lungs. I remember the dizzy spells. The hot and cold chills. The lost of taste and smell. The extreme exhaustion.</br></br>

I remember my throat swelling up, not being able to swallow. Though it has gone down some, to this day my throat is still swollen. At the height of the infection rate my heart would pound constantly with anxiety as I heard person after person shout “Man down! I need help! Someone help me please!”</br></br>

I heard these shouts two, three, four times an hour. Fear was my constant companion during those days. It choked me, it refused to allow me a moments rest or respite. I was on edge for hours on end.</br></br>

Neither meditation nor yoga would calm me. I want to scream, to shout, to yell anything to help me escape the terror that gripped me day and night. But no relief would come.</br></br>
