This story was told by a person incarcerated at an ICE/Private-Contractor facility.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, it's crazy. But, other than that, yeah, it's been pretty much a crisis, you know. And it's spread through the facilities pretty widely.</br></br>

So, and I just don't understand it, you know, considering the unequalness and what not. And four deaths in this county, I believe, so far, in this jail, in this jail because of COVID. So, it's pretty crazy.</br></br>

UCI: That is horrible. And how did the facility react to that? How do they do with testing and keeping everyone quarantined?</br></br>

Caller: It's pretty much luck of the draw, and they just move people about randomly however according to their schedules and whatever fits their protocols. I'm not for sure with all of that. But, it don't seem right that the masks that they provide us with, they're not top of the line, they're just little junk masks.</br></br>

There's no ultraviolet or UV ray machines that purify the air. There's nothing in here. It's all outdated. It's pretty crazy, you know. It really is.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, I totally understand. I feel you on that one. Did they provide testing at all?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, they've been coming by as far as every couple days and every three days and swabbing all the inmates that I'm housed with in this tank. And then, usually they've been pulling two head out, two people out, every three days for COVID.
