In the name of Allah the beneficent, the most merciful. Dear PrisonPandemic, may Allah’s peace, blessings and mercy be upon you and your family.</br></br>I received your letter during this month of Ramadan which is very rewarding for me on all levels. It’s a time for self-reflection, seeking forgiveness, redemption, moral growth, sacrifice, accountability, responsibility, awareness towards being a positive productive human being!</br></br>I’m in good health mentally, spiritually, emotionally, and physically. At 61 years young with sound mind and fear understanding of the severity of this global pandemic along with the destruction it has caused!</br></br>Prior to me coming to prison, I’ve traveled all over the world. Once it was announced that this was a pandemic, I immediately covered my mouth and hope anytime I was outside of my cell, long before they started passing out mask here. I no longer tough, embrace, or shake hands with anyone.</br></br> 

I’ve been fully vaccinated.</br></br>Some inmates and staff refused to heed the warning signs therefore many people caught the virus here. There were quite a few deaths, how many I don’t know. I do know a lot of staff lost their lives.</br></br> 

Quite a few inmates have refused to take the vaccine. Although I do believe at least 60 percent or better of the inmate population here has been vaccinated. Programming and visiting is returning to normal slowly.</br></br>Myself and others have been separated from our families and loved one’s due to the distance of where we come from. As well as more than 20 years of incarceration which brings about the “out of sight out of mind” syndrome. That happens over time to so many of us including myself.</br></br> 

My safety has been okay. I keep myself isolated from other inmates until they make mask wearing mandatory and started the vaccinations.</br></br>I keep my cell well cleaned and disinfected at all times. I work out at least three days per week, one hour to one hour and a half hours due to my age. I cut back on my food intake because it’s a starch heavy diet that the body breaks down into sugar. I drink much more water now, plus I stay on top of my body and weight as well.</br></br>The vaccination process was quick here. Being African descent, I really had to convince my black and brown brothers why it was so important for us to get the vaccine. Most of them don’t watch the news. I got them into that so they could see first-hand how COVID was revisiting our communities of color!</br></br>I see the pandemic from two points, a religious one which is the outcome of man’s refusal to adhere to God’s law through corruption, tyranny, greed, etc. The other due to man’s destruction of the planet and environment brought on all the plagues we’ve faced the past 20 years or so. From droughts, famine, climate change, damage to the eco-system, etc.</br></br>Each of these issues are spoken on in great detail throughout the “Qur’an” so it comes as no surprise to me as to what we’re facing right now! I’m submitting a poem I wrote last year as the virus took off. I write my poem under these names, I put the date I wrote each poem after my name. Take care I appreciate the work you and your students have done, may Allah guide and protect you all!</br></br>Na’Alaikum As-Salaam and peace be upon you!</br></br>Panic and fear of COVID-19. As testing for COVID-19 proceeds forward, as the virus is detected in more black and brown communities of color. These communities will be held hostage under siege in a state of quarantine.</br></br>As the outcry ramps up, the underlying feelings of resentment rises to the surface as hatred shows its true face. Because black and brown communities are presumed to be preventing the masses from moving on with their day to day lives.</br></br>No more being kind to our neighbors, no more love or help for our fellow man. The chants and cries will become surrounded and barricade these black and brown communities the day they did in Wuhan. So the disease doesn’t spread to those on this side.</br></br>Those who stockpiled all those weapons, and those who ran out and made all those impulsive buys of guns, ammunition, bullet proof vest, gas mask, and other supplies will amass in numbers. Threatening black and brown communities not to venture outside their areas for fear of COVID-19 spreading to their side.</br></br>Panic has set in, logic is no longer an option. Old stereotypes and lies from the past are now the topic and talk to fuel hidden thoughts and feelings about black and brown people. Relegating them to none important.</br></br>Is this really America? Home of the brave, land of the free. When some people become hostile and indifferent towards black and brown communities.</br></br> 

Due to pre-existing conditions, poverty, systematic racism, and all the issues that are rampant among these communities that makes them slightly susceptible to COVID-19.
