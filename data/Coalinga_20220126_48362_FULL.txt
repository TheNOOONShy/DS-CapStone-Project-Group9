This story was told by a person incarcerated at Coalinga State Hospital.</br></br>

UCI: And then what has your COVID situation been like?</br></br>

Caller: Pretty horrific. It took, what, almost a year to get staff to wear masks, shields, to dress appropriately. An unbelievable number of us died. I’ve witnessed some of it. Yeah, it was - it’s been pretty horrific.</br></br> 

I recently lost a family member to COVID back in, what, September of last year. My niece, she was, what, 53, had children, and the [unintelligible] - the hospital has, you know, been locked down and allowing one unit of about 50 patients to come out at a time.</br></br>

We were almost lifting it to go back to normal. The hospital is vaccinated, almost everyone in the hospital is vaccinated and with the boosters, the whole bit. And I have a friend who is relatively healthy on a different unit, I talk him pretty regularly he’s a Christian. He’s got COVID.</br></br> 

Their unit is quarantined and the people who test positive, they're removing from the unit and taking them down to the gymnasium. He lives in a dorm and he’s been sick for a few days. He has not done the vaccine.</br></br> 

He’s, what, 60. He’s about — I think he’s got a birthday coming up. He’s gonna be 60 or he’s 61, something like that.</br></br>

He’s just been sick. The first couple of days kicked his butt and he’s all right. I spoke with him today.</br></br> 

It’s not really a problem for him and it is COVID. But the staff are still coming into the institution, allowed to go from this quarantine unit to an un-quarantined unit and they spread this stuff around. They’re very much aware of it and the hospital staff, the hospital is aware of it. And they’re allowing this kind of behavior to continue.</br></br>

We were getting ready to come off quarantine just the other day, and a unit supervisor, who is not our, supervisor was covering for our unit supervisor, comes in and says “Well, you guys are quarantined by a staff member again.” Nobody knows who he is I can’t get even information on my niece’s death, who exposed her.</br></br>

I mean, you know, if you know this disease can kill — I’m talking about the first virus that ran through the hospital. I think we lost five patients on my unit alone, I believe. And staff just continued to expose us to the virus and, yeah, it was, you know, pretty unbelievable.</br></br>

UCI: Well I'm so so sorry to hear about your niece. My heart goes out to your family. Just to specify, about how many people are in your unit?</br></br>

Caller: About 50.</br></br>

UCI: Thanks.</br></br>

Caller: It should hold about 60 people.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm. And then you had mentioned your friend hasn’t taken the vaccine. Does that mean they’ve offered it to all of you?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, they’ve offered it to him and he didn’t want to take it. He, you know, I wouldn’t take what — there’s two kinds the Johnson and the other one, what’s the other one?</br></br>

UCI: There’s Moderna, Johnson, and Pfizer I think.</br></br>

Caller: Moderna, yeah, Moderna is the one that changes your DNA, and I don’t think the other one does, right?</br></br>

UCI: I actually don’t know enough information to be able to answer that.</br></br>

Caller: Come on you guys, you’re doing a study on this. You have to answer questions as well. You know, I mean, come on, but yeah I listen to a Christian station all day long and they got a law firm on that talks for hours. And they’re talking about the failures of the Biden administration, and they’ve taken their ignorance so far that now they can’t stop this.</br></br> 

I mean, it’s pretty unbelievable. If you look at Oklahoma, Oklahoma is probably the worst state hit in the union. God bless those people because, you know, there’s a large majority of that state are Indian, Native American.</br></br> 

Well, they’re not Native American. This was their land at one point. People took it from them because they liked it.</br></br>

At one point, if you know your history, the military back then delivered blankets with the fever in them and darn near wiped them out, you know, you could say they murdered them. But, so they’re still hit pretty hard with this and it’s kind of like, you know, the Civil War all over again, you know, trying to kill them off, but, you know, it is what it is.</br></br> 

Our government is just failing in so many ways. You know, I mean, come on, you’ve got - just look at our government. Look what’s happening in our country. Surely they don’t care about a pandemic.</br></br> 

The people who are coming on national television from the White House, they’re not practitioners and they haven’t treated personally the COVID. They’re not in the study of it they're reading what they’re given. This is factual stuff.</br></br>

UCI: You —</br></br>

Caller: You know how the American people are so gullible. They read everything. They read in the newspaper.</br></br> 

Everything they see on TV, if it’s got news attached to it, “Oh this is the news we got to believe this,” you know? It’s not true.</br></br>

Caller: Help these people. Huh?</br></br>

UCI: You had mentioned your friend has now gotten COVID. Can you explain?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, no he has COVID. Yeah, he’s sick right now.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, can you explain what precautions they take if any or how they help him with that?</br></br>

Caller: He lives in a dorm with four people, and, well, three other people. And he is just sick. All of his dorm mates are vaccinated and they’re not getting sick from him. And yeah, he, as much like myself, feels the same way about the virus and everything else.</br></br> 

I mean, I didn’t want to get vaccinated. I’m a Christian and I did not want to be vaccinated. But I had - they made a situation. I had to be vaccinated in order to visit my son.</br></br> 

I’m 69 years old. Yeah, true story. And the staff continue to spread the virus in our institution. And the people that were exposed ignorantly or intentionally by the staff, we can’t find out who they are and it’s like, "Oh, it's a big accident."</br></br>

Well you know, the families, I don’t know, I think, you know, if you’ve got a mandated policy that says this is what you’ll do to protect the population you’re working in, and you expose them ignorantly or intentionally, you should be held liable for a wrongful death. And that’s just never gonna happen.</br></br> 

We have staff, they’re talking about coming to work, and the hospital police, the DPS, when they come to work, you know, if they don’t feel good, they let them come in anyway. If you want to work, go ahead and work, you know?</br></br> 

They, the medical clinic, they have a table set up every morning, and they let staff walk right in the front door, all the way in, which is quite a walk, all the way in to that table. If they don’t have symptoms they don’t test them.</br></br>

UCI: Well, we thank you so much for calling in. Is there anything else you would like to share tonight relating to COVID?</br></br>

Caller: I hope you don’t get it. Are you vaccinated?</br></br>

UCI: I am.</br></br>

Caller: You am, okay. What shot - can I ask what vaccines you used?</br></br>

UCI: I don’t think I’m supposed to disclose that information.</br></br>

Caller: Well, no, I don’t know, ma’am. I don’t know who you are. I was just wondering for official kind of thing. Why young people today are just not doing the things they should be doing in life.</br></br> 

Why people believe our government, why a lot of things are happening. You know, I mean, look at the behavior of staff in the White House, you know? People were hating Donald Trump, saying he didn’t do this and he didn’t do that. Hey, you know what, yeah he did, yeah he did.</br></br>

They're calling - I hear people of color are calling him a racist and look what he did for people of color or different origin in our country. And look what’s happened to everything Donald Trump has done that was documented evidence and what’s happened to all of it. Look what the state of our union is in now. We’re a mess.</br></br> 

Our administration is still giving money to terrorists in the East to stop bombing Israel and they're taking that money and buying weapons to bomb Israel. I mean, Biden’s an idiot and he’s a failure. And the last two pandemics, the last two viruses, he hasn’t done anything. This is documented evidence and people want to believe these knuckleheads that come on TV, talking about stuff they don’t know anything about because they don’t have hands-on.</br></br>

And they’re not gonna have hands-on. And the American people are gullible. Anyway, thank you for your time.</br></br>

UCI: No, thank you for yours.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, bye.</br></br>

UCI: Goodbye. Bye.
