To Whom it may concern,</br></br>
My name is. I am 50 years of age and been convicted since 1990 (19 years of age). This prison CMF is a medium custody prison unlike the norm I’m use to like maximum level-4 prisons. Over the past 31 years of incarceration I have been housed in 11 of California State prisons. Here at CMF is the closest I have been to home being born and raised in the city of Richmond, which is next to Berkley and Oakland. On December 22nd 2020 I tested positive for COVID. The first thing I noticed was a severe headache around 6pm. Being houses In a cell makes one feel quite vulnerable because it would be up to the guards to be observable to recognize “MAN DOWN” as we call it.</br></br>
Anyway, trying to be a tough guy, I decided to take Tylenol and wait it out until the morning. I was unable to sleep that night and regretted not telling the guards that night. That was the 21st, now today is the 22nd. It just so happened medical staff was in my building doing COVID testing. “Any symptoms” the nurse asked. I described my headache and how I was unable to sleep. As I returned to my cell, the medical staff tested me 2 more times within 20 minutes. Medical staff never came back to my cell but a guard returned with bags, telling me to pack.</br></br>
I was moved out of the building with 3 other guys who also tested positive that day. We were moved to (BLOCKED), which was a 150-man dorm that this prison was using as a COVID-hub. At least 90% of the inmates were COVID positive however there were inmates moved in this particular dorm who were COVID positive. This is where I began to panic, along with several other inmates. As for safety, I did not feel safe and realized along with the rest of the population that if you didn’t have COVID once you get to (BLOCKED) you will be fully exposed and eventually bed ridden.</br></br>
The two words a lot of us kept hearing was “herd immunity”. The prison was trying to get everyone exposed so that they called resume normal program. A lot of us, including me, felt like our lives meant nothing! This 150 man-dorm was a revolving door every 14 days a group of inmates were housed in a different part of the facility carrying COVID. The paramedics (ambulance) came every other day due to someone either passing out or having trouble breathing.One thing COVID did do amongst the inmate population is bringing people together of all races. Inmates helping one another. COVID affected people differently, some had headaches, and shivers. While others would vomit, cough, and be unable to eat. Some of us, our back hurt, bones, aches, even diarrhea.</br></br>
I must say if I may this was even more scarier than a full fledge prison riot. I believe it was more so the unknown, this unknown virus knocking down healthy, strong, authentic men. As for vaccination, they are available. Although most are afraid due to the unknown, and conspiracies, even when it comes to the flu shot. Some of us in prison read too many books of conspiracy theories so of course after watching the news, talking about these vaccinations, most refuse to take it. As for me, yep! I was hesitant in the beginning but the more I saw cars lined up (on the news) I decided to fold. At this time I’m still unsure but hey! It’s too late now. I received two shots and received as card that made me fell like I signed my life away.</br></br>
Thanks to family and friends, and having a strong line of communication my experience probably wasn’t as bad as others but I feel for those who didn’t or don’t have anyone to confide in.At this time visits are for an hour social distancing is a must, and a mask. Visitors have to show proof of vaccination.</br></br>
The end.</br></br>
