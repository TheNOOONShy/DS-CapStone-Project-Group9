This story was told by a person incarcerated at Elmwood Correctional Facility.</br></br>

Caller: I haven't seen the sky and the only hour that we're able to come out is to be able to shower. And then we go into a room where there's a TV and there's some telephones that we have access to. Besides that, we're locked in that room for 23 hours a day.</br></br>

And we can't exercise. We can't breathe in air. And it's - it's very hard.</br></br>

The food's pretty bad. We've had maggots in our food. From what I understand, and I'm not positive, is that the men used to cook. And provided pretty decent meals.</br></br>

But since COVID has hit, they're using an outside vendor to, you know, ship the food. And it's being shipped from Washington. I forgot the name of the vendor that's shipping it. But it's somewhere from Washington.</br></br>

And the food is expired by many months every time we eat it. And the beginning part of November, we actually able - were able to see maggots in our food. Many of the girls here have then since gone on a hunger strike because of the spoiled food.</br></br>

And then they just kind of depend on the food that they can buy with their own money through commissary. What else? The guards are okay here. They've not been mean really to us like that – or anything like that.</br></br> 

They've - they've been pretty decent. But the problem is understaffing. And when there's understaffing, we go into a lockdown.</br></br>

And what I mean by a lockdown is we are literally locked down. We cannot leave the room at all. So, instead of the 23 hours in the room, we're there 24 hours.</br></br>

And then we don't even have access to a shower. And we're probably in a lockdown on average between three to four days a week. We're - we are confined to our room for 24 hours a day. And that goes on.</br></br> 

We just – we were in a lockdown last night. Right now, obviously since I'm on a phone, we are not on a lockdown. And going back to the programming time, that one hour that we're allowed to go out.</br></br>

We never know what time it's gonna be. So, it's not like we can tell, you know, our family. Okay, we'll call you at 6 o'clock or we'll call you at 7 o'clock or anything like that.</br></br> 

Because we literally have no idea. And right now, it's, you know, 9 o'clock. So, sometimes, you know, families are not available at that time.</br></br>

And certainly, our attorneys are not available at 9 o'clock p.m. So, it's very difficult to have contact with the outside world. So, we're really kind of at their mercy as to when we can come out of the room and use a phone.</br></br>

And as far as like writing people, you know, we can write letters and stuff like that. But we are not given any - any pens to write with. We're given pencils, but no access to a pencil sharpener.</br></br>

So, once that pencil goes dull, we have no way of writing at all. And as far as paper goes, you have to buy paper if you want to write anything. And you have to buy an envelope, and buy a stamp, and all that kinds of stuff.
