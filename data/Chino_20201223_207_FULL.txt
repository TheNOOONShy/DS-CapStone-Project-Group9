Dear PrisonPandemic,</br></br> 
Someone provided me with your address and that person stated you would like to hear from others all that they have felt, endured, and experienced during this pandemic.</br></br> 

Let me begin by saying that from the very beginning of this crisis, I worked in the housing unit designated on the facility. East yard, as a frontline worker. When we first began working, a select few of us, we were never provided with PPE gear except latex gloves. It was a month into the COVID-19 crisis when I received my first mask, one that is only supposed to be used for one or two hours, yet I had to reuse it for days on end.</br></br> When staff first began clearing the housing unit known as Colusa Hall as a COVID-19 unit, staff and guards used this as an opportunity to ship some prisoners to another herd to get even with other guards they had issues with.</br></br> 

I was one of those prisoners moved to another yard. A week later my boss brought me back. One week later the same vindictive guard had me moved to another yard a second time, resulting in me receiving a disciplinary write up. The following day, when my boss brought me back this officer who moved me spoke to the sergeant in charge and suggested I be written up for manipulation of staff.</br></br> 

This issue is still under appeal at the director’s level of review and far beyond the time limits allowed. When I was finally allowed, moved a third time to the temporary gym dorm, I returned to Colusa Hall daily to work.</br></br> 

Working in the COVID-19 unit was solely on a voluntary basis. By the end of May I had been working double shifts for two months with no days off. I volunteered my service because guards did not want anything to do with prisoners in isolation due to COVID-19.</br></br> 

Their attitudes at the time were that those inmates could fend for themselves. By my volunteering to be a frontline worker I was able to show these men some humanity and kindness, helping when I could and, in some cases, notifying their loved ones by phones that they were isolated in the COVID-19 unit with the virus.</br></br> 
The system seriously fouled up from the beginning. No inmates on this yard were exposed and the administration selected one of the housing units on this yard as a COVID-19 unit, thus exposing the entire population to the virus.</br></br> 

When the first cases of COVID-19 were found on this yard the entire year should have been placed on isolation; however, inmates were going to and from work with staff and other prisoners alike, spreading the virus.</br></br> 

By the end of May, the gym dorm had a severe outbreak of nearly half the gym population. Rather than isolating the infected, the medical staff left them there, thus infecting others. Only after about a week were they isolated, but the damage was done. I stayed on quarantine for nearly two months. When it was over, I was no longer allowed to go to work.</br></br> 

During the time I worked in the COVID-19 unit, many guys were rushed to the hospital. Some of these men were never to return because they died due to COVID-19. Around May or June staff were supposed to be checked regularly but in October one officer working in the gym dorm exposed all there to the virus.</br></br> 

It was and in mandatory for all prisoners and guards to wear masks, but it’s a common practice of guards not to do so. And, thus, in October, 50 percent of the population there were infected with COVID-19, myself included. Just as in the beginning the medical staff only make an appearance twice a day to all in isolation.</br></br>

Often men who love serious sudden symptoms are seen too late. Men who have symptoms of the virus should be seen more frequently than once in the morning and once during the evening hours. I showed no symptoms after showing positive for the virus. In saying I would say the medical attention to the inmates infected was mediocre at best.</br></br> 

To be inside with this virus has been a strain to me. I have family on the outside that I do not even know if they are alive or dead. Friends of mine on the outside are up in age and I worry daily about their safety. Many guys' relationships have been strained due to no visiting since February or March of 2020.</br></br> I am not worried about myself because I worked for the frontline from day one and never got ill. So when I showed no symptoms after being infected, I doubted I would get ill. But I have seen the faces and the fatal results that some endured and the sight was not pretty.</br></br> 

I soon learned that the guys who were not eating or seemed to sleep 24 hours a day were being hit the hardest. I did what I could for the prisoners in isolation, such as passing messages, giving them toiletries, providing them with coffee and even picking up their outgoing mail to family and friends that some officers would not do.</br></br> 

I exposed myself daily, but I felt that if I were in their shoes, I would have hoped someone would do that for me. This was aside of myself I had not experienced before like this. I have missed Christian fellowship during the crisis and those who used to come into prison to share in the prison ministries we have heard nothing of.</br></br> 

Our hearts go out to them, their families, and all those directly effected by this virus. I do not care if you use my name. I have nothing to hide and until others speak out nothing will change. If you have anything specific to ask, feel free.</br></br>
 Sincerely.
