This letter was written by a person incarcerated at SATF (California Substance Abuse Treatment Facility and State Prison).</br></br>

Hello,</br></br> 

Thank you for your concern about prisons during the COVID-19 pandemic. Me and other inmates have been subjected to harsh punishment due to the pandemic. Here in the CSATF we have six to eight cellmates. If one person tests positive the institution will remove him.</br></br>

Then lockdown the rest of the facility for 14 days. The correction officers treat us badly, as if we are being disciplined. They also crowd us together and make it impossible to social distance.</br></br>

Many inmates died, some being close to their release dates. I only have about eight months to go in here before parole. I wish to leave healthy.</br></br>

Thank you.</br></br>

Sincerely.
