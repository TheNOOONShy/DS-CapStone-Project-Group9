This story was told by a person incarcerated at Colusa County Jail.</br></br>

UCI: What facility are you currently housed at?</br></br>

Caller: Colusa County Jail.</br></br>

UCI: Thank you. And what has the COVID situation at your facility been like?</br></br>

Caller: It’s been pretty crazy. They don't quarantine us for COVID or if anybody's sick. They, you know, we have to wear masks all the time.</br></br>
 
I don't know. What else do you want to know? It’s weird. It’s like my first term, so I’ve never been in jail before this time in my life.</br></br>

UCI: When you say they don’t quarantine you, do you mean when you test positive? Or when you first.</br></br>

Caller: No, Like when we first come into jail. Like, for like 24 hours to see if you have COVID or whatever, they just swab your nose and do a little nose swab and it takes 10 minutes, and then they let you come in.</br></br>

UCI: Oh. okay. And if you were to test positive would they quarantine you?</br></br>

Caller: I think so.</br></br>

UCI: Okay, and you had mentioned they enforce face coverings. Do they provide those for you?</br></br>

Caller: Yes.</br></br>

UCI: Okay and then -</br></br>

Caller: So we don’t have to wear them in the pod with other girls.</br></br>

UCI: Okay.</br></br>

Caller: You know what I'm saying? So, like, there's eight of us in one cell and we don't have to wear them in the cell with each other. Just when we go out of our cell.</br></br>

UCI: Okay, and when was the first time the only time they tested you or do they test you more often than that?</br></br>

Caller: No. They test you if you like tell them you have a cold or a scratchy throat or sniffles or whatever they test you again for COVID. But it could just be allergies or whatever, but they test you for COVID all the time.</br></br>

UCI: And do the staff follow proper protocol?</br></br>

Caller: They always have masks on.</br></br>

UCI: And do they sanitize the area or anything like that?</br></br>

Caller: Honestly, I haven’t seen no sanitizing of any area that I've been in at all.</br></br>

UCI: Okay.</br></br>

Caller: Like when I go into the nurse, she doesn't sanitize the table or anything before I go in or after I leave or anything.</br></br>

UCI: Do they provide any form of sanitization that you could use yourself?</br></br>

Caller: They have little things of hand sanitizer, like on the wall, we could walk by and pump it in our hand. Oh well, okay so they have these things on the wall that has no hand sanitizer in them.</br></br>

UCI: Oh.</br></br>

Caller: So, they provide it, but just not refill it.</br></br>

UCI: Interesting.</br></br>

Caller: Right?</br></br>

UCI: Yeah. It defeats the purpose of it. You said you’ve only been there a short time, have they offered the vaccine to anyone there?</br></br>

Caller: You know what, they offered it to me, and I've been here for almost 50 days, and I have not heard nothing about it except the first to second day I was here. Nothing more about it.
