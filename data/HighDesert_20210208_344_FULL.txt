Governing the powerless.</br></br>

To whom it may concern,</br></br>

Everyone on Earth felt the strange impact of the 2020 pandemic caused by COVID-19. But some felt the abrupt changes powerless to cease its destructive reverberations throughout their lives.</br></br> 

As a member of the prison population, I found myself in the category of the powerless. My life was subjected to the thoughts and decisions of authorities, who had no prior experience governing during a crisis of this magnitude.</br></br>

I am a diabetic with hypertension, weighing 250 pounds, standing five feet, 10 inches. As a 43-year-old African American, I am categorized as high-risk for COVID-19.</br></br>

In March 2020, all visitation was stopped. The stress began to build from that point. No Zoom call with friends and family. Just one collect call, on a walled landline, for almost 15 minutes each day. Three-way calls are prohibited, as grounds to terminate phone privileges immediately if detected for the day.</br></br>

If I call my mother, I have to hope she’s already spoken with my wife, son, and other family members. Calling friends is absolutely out of the question because my stresses have me checking in with my asthmatic wife and 80-year-old parents daily.</br></br>

During this time, the authorities continue to transfer prisoners to and from the prison. We were given masks and told to stay apart. While prison staff with antagonistic beliefs about the pandemic searched our cells, frisked our clothing and bodies, and handled our property.</br></br>

Finally, the inevitable formula manifested and this isolated area of mostly pessimistic citizens got the truth of which they’d refused to believe COVID-19 infections. It was around November and that is the month of my birthday. The prison went on quarantine lockdown. Nurses came by and tested the entire population.</br></br>

If you tested positive, you were moved to another building and the infections spread rapidly until a group of inmates who were not infected refused to move to an infected building. The officers took the hand sanitizer stating it had alcohol in it and didn’t provide us any other sanitizer.</br></br> 

The director of CDCR sent the sanitizer to us and we never got to use it. Nurses came around three times a day to check our breathing, temperature, and pulse. The medical staff did a good job making sure we were okay at great risk to themselves.</br></br>

After 30 days, the infections went away but we continued to be isolated. We begged for the Jpay tablets and kiosks, which allow us to email family and friends. We were told this yard is too dangerous to have what the equally dangerous opposite yard here already has--Jpay tablets.</br></br>

We begged for family visits promising to quarantine after the visits for a fortnight, but no contact visits will be allowed until May or June 2021. The video visits are once a month for almost 30 minutes. They start late and end at the scheduled time. I received 21 minutes for my visit.</br></br>

I am glad that I made it through COVID-19 so far without any losses. My celly lost his mother two weeks ago. I know many say prisoners deserve harsh treatment but I must tell you, that thinking is flawed because the majority of prisoners will be returned to society and I know I don’t want some angry, agitated person set free in my family’s community.</br></br> 

We don’t deserve back rubs but being treated with dignity isn’t too much to ask during a pandemic. No hand sanitizer or distribution of cleaning products.</br></br>

Sincerely.
