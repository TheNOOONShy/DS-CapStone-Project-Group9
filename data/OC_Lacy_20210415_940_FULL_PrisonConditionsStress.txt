To whom it may concern,</br></br>


Hello, I received your letter. I was not going to write you back because I did not want to waste a stamp (I don't have too many). But I thought if you guys could  care enough to write me and care enough to try to change our not-so-good conditions. We do not get any hot meals. We get bologna sandwiches for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. I don't know if they think it will stop the spread of the virus or if it is just more convenient for them. We are locked down pretty much 24 hours a day, we come out for 30 minutes a day by ourselves. Most of us are in the cell by ourselves and we get sack lunches brought to our cells.</br></br>


We have not had any visits from the outside world, which does not make sense because the visits are behind a glass, no contact. All of this is really making people depressed and going crazy. I have seen and heard people screaming and in other words “losing it.” We all use the same unsanitary shower and phones. They do not clean anything in here and filth is everywhere.</br></br>


If you were not crazy before coming in here, you might be before you leave this place. Officers treat everyone like you are the scum of the earth like you are not worth helping. I understand that a lot of people in here have broken the law in some way but it's like adding salt to the wound. If being locked up is not hard enough, being away from our loved ones, then the conditions in here make it ten times worse. I know you guys don't have to care but I really appreciate you guys at least trying. Thank you for thinking about the forgotten.</br></br>
