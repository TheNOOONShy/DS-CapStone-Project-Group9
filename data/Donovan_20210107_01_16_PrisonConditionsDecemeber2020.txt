This story was told by a person incarcerated at Donovan.</br></br>

I am here at R.J. Donovan, main facility. On December 12th, December 10th, we had an outbreak of isolated inmates in building one and two with COVID. The CDCR acted appropriately by quarantining the building.</br></br>

Then it spreaded from free staff from the central kitchen into buildings three, four, and five. We tested in my building four on December 15th. Over 40 inmates tested. Four inmates came back positive for COVID-19 on December 15th.</br></br>

The CDCR did not remove anybody from the building. They left them here to come out, touch the railing, use the phones, share the showers, walk out, breathe on every inmate. By December 17th, the entire building was infected.</br></br>

Over 160 inmates.
