This story was told by a person incarcerated at Fresno County Jail.</br></br> 

Caller: What we need most of all in this -- this -- is free phone calls to our families. Because a lot of our families can't afford -- I don't have any family, I'm alone, so -- but I'm speaking for -- for the majority here.</br></br>

UCI: Mhm.</br></br>

Caller: And I speak for them because they -- it's hard for them to speak because of the various reasons; however, what we do need is free phone calls.</br></br> 

That -- that would help during -- during this lockdown that we're in quarantine. This -- this would encourage, you know, and promote, you know, empathy, you know, and parenting, you know. You know, we have children we want to speak to, and we can't because we can't afford it, you know?</br></br>

Because it's really -- it's very expensive, these phone calls. And our families are burdened, you know, right now because they can't work, you know?</br></br>

UCI: Mhm.</br></br>

Cllaer: And there's no way to pay for em. So, that's what we're experiencing now is not being able to contact our families because we get no visits during quarantine.</br></br>

UCI: Mhm.</br></br>

Caller: So all we do is we have -- we have two phones for 55 guys. There's two phones inside this -- this pod. So, if there was anybody out there who's -- who's interested in donating or finding a way to get free phone calls for our families during this quarantine.
