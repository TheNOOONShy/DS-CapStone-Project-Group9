This story was told by a person incarcerated at Coalinga State Hospital.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, can you explain what precautions they take if any or how they help him with that?</br></br>

Caller: He lives in a dorm with four people, and, well, three other people. And he is just sick. All of his dorm mates are vaccinated and they’re not getting sick from him. And yeah, he, as much like myself, feels the same way about the virus and everything else.</br></br> 

I mean, I didn’t want to get vaccinated. I’m a Christian and I did not want to be vaccinated. But I had - they made a situation. I had to be vaccinated in order to visit my son.</br></br> 

I’m 69 years old. Yeah, true story. And the staff continue to spread the virus in our institution. And the people that were exposed ignorantly or intentionally by the staff, we can’t find out who they are and it’s like, "Oh, it's a big accident."</br></br>

Well you know, the families, I don’t know, I think, you know, if you’ve got a mandated policy that says this is what you’ll do to protect the population you’re working in, and you expose them ignorantly or intentionally, you should be held liable for a wrongful death. And that’s just never gonna happen.</br></br> 

We have staff, they’re talking about coming to work, and the hospital police, the DPS, when they come to work, you know, if they don’t feel good, they let them come in anyway. If you want to work, go ahead and work, you know?</br></br> 

They, the medical clinic, they have a table set up every morning, and they let staff walk right in the front door, all the way in, which is quite a walk, all the way in to that table. If they don’t have symptoms they don’t test them.
