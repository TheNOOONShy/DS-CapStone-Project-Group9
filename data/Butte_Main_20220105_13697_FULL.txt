This story was told by a person incarcerated at Butte County Main Jail.</br></br>

UCI: What has the COVID situation been like at your facility?</br></br>

Caller: Nothing.</br></br>

UCI: How has the vaccination situation been like at your facility?</br></br>

Caller: They’re slow. I think they came by once already and gave everyone a shot.</br></br>

UCI: How has the COVID situation at your facility affected your loved ones?</br></br>

Caller: Well, I could tell you that it’s affected everyone’s loved ones in here. It’s like, everyone’s loved ones are dying. And mostly, people are not caring no more and they just - basically, everyone’s getting violent.</br></br>

UCI: Violent? Can you elaborate on that?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah. Well, so, if your mom and dad dies, or your grandma and grandpa dies, then you have nothing else in the world. So, therefore, you just don’t care no more. So you just wild out and you start beating people up for no reason. And there’s been a lot of that around this county jail.</br></br>

UCI: Wow. Has that, like, have you ever been involved in something like that? Where people have come and attacked you or anything?</br></br>

Caller: No, not me. But, I’m probably the biggest dude in the block, so I don’t think no one’s gonna attack me, you know?</br></br>

UCI: I get you.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, so they attack other people. And it's sad to see people’s loved ones dying, and then people not caring no more. So, yeah, the pandemic has gratefully affected the struggle, you know?</br></br>

UCI: How have you been coping with the crisis?</br></br>

Caller: Well, basically all I do is draw. I sit in my cell and draw, and I try not to think about nothing else in the world, you know? I even wrote a book, a COVID book.</br></br>

UCI: You wrote a COVID book?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, I wrote a COVID book. It’s called [redacted].</br></br>

UCI: And what is it about?</br></br>

Caller: It’s about a little clown and a little clown girl that - basically, talking about the COVID and what it did to them when they were locked up. But it's not like, being locked up, but like, in general. Like, it’s a little blue clown.</br></br> 

It start's off with "Hey, my buddy, my friend, my pal, why you look so down?" It used to be such a happy clown. And then it goes on because COVID flu, you know, he lost all his loved ones. "You know, my grandma and grandpa, mom and dad too. So that's, now you know why I’m so blue."</br></br>

As my story continues, he goes from being a blue clown and starts beginning to be positive in life and he turns into a golden clown. And he changes colors as the story goes, and he finds God and he’s a golden, shiny clown now, because he found God. And it just tells the story about what the COVID flu did to him, you know. Which the clown is me.</br></br>

UCI: Wow. That's-</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, and I have it.</br></br>

UCI: Go ahead.</br></br>

Caller: And I wrote it for kids. It’s a kid, a COVID flu book for kids, you know.</br></br>

UCI: Wow, that’s really moving. And you said you represent the clown in a sense? Like you relate to it?</br></br>

Caller: Yes. My grandma died of COVID, I have no father, I have no grandpa. I’m in here. My sister takes care of me, somewhat, whenever she can, but basically, I’ve been locked up for over 40 – I’m 41 years old, and I’m on – court records, I’ve been sentenced to 47 years.</br></br>

UCI: Wow.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, so I’ve been in here most of my life, you know? So, I know a lot. Like, prisons, what goes on in prison and how it affects people.</br></br> 

My brother died while I was in here, and ever since that, I’ve stopped caring. And I’ve been doing this my whole life, you know?</br></br>

UCI: What would you have made the situation at your facility better?</br></br>

Caller: I mean, they should have, I really [unintelligible], have video visits would be nice. They had them here before, then they took them. And then so people can see their loved ones, at least through video.</br></br>

They have us locked down in our cells 22 hours a day. We come out for two hours a day. We’re basically in our cells all the time. With people dying and stuff, like that doesn’t help.</br></br> 

It just makes people think about it, and they get angrier, and angrier, and angrier. I’ve been in a cell most of my life, and ever since my brother passed away, I've been - I was a violent, violent person.</br></br>

But, as I got older, I kind of like, shied away from that, and started drawing and working out. So, I work out a lot to console that anger, you know?</br></br>

UCI: Yeah. People have their healthy and unhealthy coping mechanisms to deal with that kind of stuff. So, I kind of see where you’re going. I think you drawing and making a story, like a children’s book, it's really moving. And you know, not a lot of people can cope with COVID, and it leads to a bunch of bad things.</br></br>

But, how you’ve been handling it, it sounds like you’ve been taking it really well. Even though your situation is not similar to like, most of us.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, I’m going to prison for another 11 years. So, I mean, this has been my life. I’ve been state raised and I’ve been here. And I’m probably gonna be here more, you know? Like, I don’t know. Like, I’m hoping I get out and still change it, but if it doesn’t, oh well.</br></br>

You know, like I say, I’m probably carrying this cross myself, this guy carries his cross, you know?</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, wow. Is there anything else you want the people to know about your experience?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, I want them to know that, it’s kind of like, heartbreaking to see other people break down because their loved ones are passing away due to COVID. You know, now there’s a stronger COVID. I mean, like my story says, COVID in 2001, then a stronger COVID, flu number two, and then now there’s the corona, whatever it is, coronavirus, whatever they said it was.</br></br>

You know, like, it’s getting worser and worser. And probably a lot of people are going through it. You know? Like, I’ve seen a lot of pain and sorrow in here, and I think it's heartbreaking that they can’t see their loved ones. You know? Like, it’s crazy.</br></br> 

UCI: Yeah, it is crazy. How is the officers there, like, the staff? How have they been handling it?</br></br>

Caller: Well, they run around with their little masks on. The medical here is not good, you know. Like, they, people complain, and then nothing. They just ignore people, you know. So, yeah. I think they should have a better medical response team here. But.</br></br>

UCI: You said that they ignore people?</br></br>

Caller: Huh?</br></br>

UCI: You said that they ignore people?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, they ignore people sometimes. You know, like, my friend was talking about, like, he had a broken spleen. And they ignored him for two days, three days. You know?</br></br>

And they finally came and seen him today. You know? He could’ve died. You know, they just, I guess, their medical is not that good.</br></br>

UCI: Geez. Wow.</br></br>

Caller: I just complained about my knee today and they just ignored me. I ripped one of my ligaments and I need an MRI and some type of surgery, and they were like, “Oh, well, we can’t do nothing for you.” So I’m supposed to limp around with a messed up leg. I’ve been doing it for eight months.</br></br>

UCI: For eight months?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, for eight months.</br></br>

UCI: Geez.</br></br>

Caller: With ripped ligaments in my knee.</br></br> 

UCI: So, even if you said you had COVID or anything like that, they wouldn’t respond that quickly?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, they - they – I mean, I’ve already submitted grievances to them, I’ve threatened to sue them, and they still don’t want do nothing.</br></br>

UCI: Wow.</br></br>

Caller: Like, the medical here is just, like, they don’t even care about us. They treat us like, the last of the worst of the worst. Just because we’re in here, because what? We’re poor, and sometimes we gotta commit crimes to survive.</br></br>

Like me, I’m a mechanic. And before I came to prison for what I came here, they harassed me and took all my cars, you know. They took seven cars from me before I went on a high speed chase ‘cause I got tired of them taking my cars.</br></br>

UCI: Wow.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah. They took seven cars from me, and then my last little bucket that I had – I had no doors on it, no hood, I have two donuts, overheating, and they want to come and try to take that from me. So like, I’m done. So I just took off on them. And I got 11 years for it.</br></br>

UCI: Geez.</br></br> 

Caller: How am I supposed to survive if I can’t drive around and sell my cars? You know? Like, I’m not getting that coke with money. I’m not getting the assistance from the state like everyone else is – was. I actually had, like, my own little business going and I was surviving.</br></br>

But, every time I built something and tried to sell it, they took it from me. So they were basically taking my food money, they were taking my rent money, they were taking my clothing money, they were taking my electricity money. I mean, so there’s no way I could have survived by them taking everything that I fixed, you know?</br></br>

UCI: Yes. So not only did they take everything from you, but they're also not helping you out with this pandemic at all.</br></br> 

Caller: No. Now they took my life from me. And now I’m stuck in here because they want to harass me.</br></br>

UCI: Wow. So, you talked about, earlier you talked about drawing and everything. Do they have reduced visitations and programs at your prison?</br></br>

Caller: No, they’re not [unintelligible] right now, you can go out and visit through the glass and stuff for a certain amount of time. I think it’s like 45 minutes.</br></br>

UCI: What about the programs?</br></br>

Caller: What do you mean the programs?</br></br>

UCI: Do they offer any programs over there? Like, music classes, anything like that?</br></br>

Caller: Nothing.</br></br> 

UCI: Nothing?</br></br>

Caller: Nothing educational, nothing. We’re just wasting away in the cells.</br></br>

UCI: And the only way you’ve been keeping yourself busy during this pandemic is, you said, drawing and working out or going outside? Like two hours?</br></br>

Caller: I draw all day long. And I work out most of my time. So I work out for three hours straight, and then I wake up in the morning at like seven and draw all the way to one. And then from 1:00 to 2:00 – from 12:00 to 2:00, I work out, and then I come out here for two hours.</br></br>

Then I go back inside, and I start drawing again all the way until nighttime. So basically I sit there and draw all day long. And I sometimes, I come up with inventions. Like, I came up with how to get free electricity.</br></br>

I read the bible. I disect the Bible. I’ve learned a lot of stuff out of the Bible. And a lot of [unintelligible] can’t figure it out [unintelligible] Bible out, but I figured one thing out. Like, okay, so, if God created Adam and Eve out of dirt, what color are they?</br></br>

UCI: Brown.</br></br>

Caller: They would be brown. So if God created humans and its image, then what color is God?</br></br>

UCI: Brown.</br></br>

Caller: Yes. What’s faster than the speed of light?</br></br>

UCI: Sound.</br></br>

Caller: Darkness. Sound will never pass darkness. Darkness will always be in front of light.</br></br> 

UCI: Wow.</br></br>

Caller: Yes.</br></br>

UCI: That’s moving.</br></br>

Caller: I’m smart. And all they do is just sit me in a box. Infinite power.</br></br>  

You, I came with the - this, so you take an electric motor, and you connect an electric motor to an alternator, and then once you got the motor turning the alternator, you got to mimic the RPM for a 1,000 rotations a minute. So, it charges the battery like a car would.</br></br>

And now, once you get the cycle to where it's continuous free electricity, then you add extra alternators to that motor, and then you add extra batteries so now you got infinite power. Power free, forever.</br></br>

UCI: Oh okay, I see what you mean. Well, I think it said we only have a minute left, but I would like to thank you very much for participating in this project, this PrisonPandemic project. Your story was very moving, and I’m so sorry to hear your situation. I hope things get better once you get out. </br></br>

Please consider telling your friends about us and seeing if they would like to call in.</br></br>

Caller: Yes, sir.</br></br>

UCI: This hotline is open 5:00 to 9:00, Monday through Friday. Just give us a call. Tell your friends to give us a call, let them tell their story too. We would greatly appreciate it. I thank you for telling us your story. This was very moving.</br></br>

Caller: Have a good day.</br></br>

UCI: You too.</br></br>

Caller: Bye.
