This letter was written by a person incarcerated at CMC (California Men’s Colony).</br></br>Hello PrisonPandemic, how are you? I do hope that these few simple words of mines, find you and your colleagues in both good health and high spirits. As for myself, I am holding up pretty good, under these not so ideal circumstances (COVID-19).</br></br>First and foremost, I’ve been incarcerated for 18 years and four months, for crimes I am actually innocent of. I have maintained my innocence for the entire 18 years, four months.</br></br>Being locked up during a global pandemic can be very very stressful, especially if the people who are responsible for keeping you safe, is the very some individuals, who are putting your life in jeopardy, by not wearing face masks or practicing social distancing (prison staff & officials).</br></br>I tested positive for the coronavirus on January 6, 2021 and is pretty certain that I caught it from consuming the prison meal, served to us in our cells, during that period. I quarantined for 14 days and only had mild symptoms that resulted in mild chills, loss of taste and smell.</br></br> Due to being locked up in my cell for approximately one month and a half, I now have a vitamin D deficiency. I have lost two close friend, and an aunt from the virus that cause me great stress, from not being able to know what’s going on, due to no phone calls, during this time period.</br></br> Right now, I am looking for a pen pal to help me get through this difficult time and assist me with proving my innocence. If you know anyone who would like to correspond with me, please feel free to shoot them my info. My sister graduated from UCI in year 2002 I believe.</br></br>Right now, the Governor is considering my petition to him, to have my sentence commuted to time serve (18 years plus). And I know it will happen eventually, due to my positive programing and rehabilitative efforts (I.e., college and self-help groups). The pen pal who do decide to write me, will get a down to earth, humble, honest, and trustworthy guy, not to mention good looking.</br></br>Proving my innocence is my number one priority and whatever assistance you can provide me will be highly appreciated. In this moment, at this time (2021), you can change the course of history by assisting me prove my innocence and becoming a lifelong friend, if you choose to.</br></br> Thank you very much for listening to my story. Youre help, assistance, and consideration is highly appreciated.</br></br>Sincerely said.
