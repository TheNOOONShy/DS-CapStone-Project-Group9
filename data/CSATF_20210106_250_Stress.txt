I lost my #1 supportive – my father – October 2020 so . . . I don’t even know the pain I’m dealing w/ . . . Please, I go 2 BPT. in 2021 – soon I almost made it home . . . my girlfriend is holding on by a thread – prolly won’t last. 10-?-20. This yard begin COVID testing + guess what. We all damn near have a had the shit . . .  apparently it’s hella rare 4 us to get sick tho ?? no where near like u see on TV . . . this D yd. has been flipped + we all moved around 2B quarantined ect, . . .</br></br> 

So now recently . . . our food has been cut down. No joke – went from 4 slices of bread – last yr . . 2 slices – now 4 month ago  3 saltine crackers = 6 small crackers – now 2 = 4 cracker w/ our state issue lunch. ??</br></br>

So – w/ that being said – I haven’t eaten touched bases on some of us – no longer receiving $4 canteen because our families/casinos are effected + our family struggle to pay rent-bills. So shit trickles down hill . . . I’m in D-2-SATF + there’s been 3 serious incidents where people lost hope + tried to take there own life :(. U would be surprised what a kind word can do 4 a guy who is on the edge – or a shot of coffee . . .</br></br> 

I’m a Native American + 1 of the lucky 1s who r able 2 get canteen + I try + share but shit is getting though behind these walls . . .</br></br>
