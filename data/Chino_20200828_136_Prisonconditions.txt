I have a great job on the yard, I get out of my cell for 7 til 3:30 p.m. But now one man was sick, now we are all lockdown. I went from eight hours to zero hours a day. I love to play handball but as of December 7, no more sports on the yards. I got COVID-19 in May. Now I lost my cellie on October 2. He got it. It's not safe here. It's not safe out there. We just have to pray for God to help us all. It is difficult but life is difficult.
