Dear UCI PrisonPandemic,</br></br>

Hello</br></br>

I’m currently locked up at the Correctional Training Facility central yard, and I’m trying to get an emergency release due to I am high risk for the coronavirus. I’m 44 years of age. I’m insulin dependent type two diabetic with asthma, hypertension, and I’m also struggling with obesity.</br></br>

Now here at this prison they have had big outbreaks and it is impossible to practice social distance with two people in a cell. And if you say you don’t want two to a cell it’s like catching. Because you are forced to take a cell or get a 155 for disobeying a direct order, which I honestly believe is wrong.</br></br> 

And I am trying to make it home to see my family and my only child that I have not seen since he was five years old. And now he is 21 years of age and forgives me for not being there for him like a father is supposed to be.</br></br>

Even though it wasn’t just me but I’m taking responsibility for my actions and absents, but I have never stopped loving him. Nor did I ever forget about him and I’m so proud of the man he became. He’s a student at university majoring in political science, and that's my story.</br></br>

Thank you.
