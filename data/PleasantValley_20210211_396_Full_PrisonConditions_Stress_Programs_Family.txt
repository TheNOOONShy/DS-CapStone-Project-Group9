PrisonPandemic,</br></br>

I'm submitting this letter for a change in the prison system to help inmates like myself have more programs this year. This COVID-19 virus is not going to stop, is airborne.</br></br>
      
At longest we wear our masks and wash our hands, will slow down the spread. Tell them we can't continue to stay locked down in this cement box. It's very stressful and depressing.</br></br>

The most downfall of this situation is our family visits. It's very sad. We can't see our loved ones.</br></br>

Help us have more dayroom and yard this year, follow by group meetings, self-help groups, anything to keep our minds busy. This is a programming yard.</br></br>

We want a change this year for the better. United States of America, we all stand, we are all in this together. Thank you and God bless you.
