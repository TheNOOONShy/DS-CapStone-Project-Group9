This story was told by a person incarcerated at Chino.</br></br>

Caller: Well, California Institution for Men (CIM) was one of the basically the starting points for COVID within the CDCR, the California prison system. It started, the cases started here back in early March of this year. The yard that I'm on currently (facility A), we didn't start really seeing an impact until sometime in April, we had a building go on quarantine.</br></br>

Basically, they didn't handle anything, they just put the building on quarantine, we still mixed with the individuals. The buildings here, there's eight on the yard. The buildings can house 160 inmates and a wide open dorm setting- bunks are about 42 inches apart, less in some situations, and they are double bunks.</br></br>

There's virtually no ventilation in the building, no air circulation. On April 30, they decided to drop the population in the in the buildings. And so they took approximately 30 inmates per building and just called a bunch of names.</br></br>

I was one of the names at this time, that got removed from my building, and sent over to B yard, facility B, which is right next door and was a reception center. And basically thrown in a cell by myself. I suffer from epileptic seizures, which of course is a problem and I’ve had suicide attempt issues when I'm housed alone in previous situations.</br></br>

So basically, they threw me in a cell by myself along with approximately 150 other people in cells by ourselves with wide open front doors. A week later, they decided to start COVID testing on facility A. My understanding was close to 100 inmates tested positive.</br></br>

Facility B building I was in we had almost 40 inmates out of that initial test of those of us that were moved over, test positive, I had people all the way around me, above me, and to each side of me that tested positive and we were all still left in these cells. I did not test positive. I have not had a positive test thus far, and I just had my 14th test today, today.</br></br>

So basically, what they were doing is like the folks that tested positive were there, they just put a sign on the door said isolation, and they left them locked in their cell for their 14-day isolation. They didn't even get a chance to use a phone or take a shower.</br></br>

So it made it very counterproductive for anybody that was having symptoms, which I did go through a period of time where I was having symptoms, but nobody wanted to report them because they were afraid of the situation they would be put in, cut off from their family, stuck in a cell alone for, you know, 24 hours a day, 14 straight days without even the ability to use a shower.</br></br>

It was very, very cruel what they were doing to these folks, because the way I looked at it is you could end up dying and your family would never know that you were even sick. So it made it really counterintuitive for anybody they're telling you “well report a symptom” but nobody wanted to because they were afraid of getting locked down in the situation they were.</br></br>

I ended up lasting 30- approximately 30 days over there before I deteriorated mentally. And I ended up going to crisis bed on the first week in June on suicide watch, I'd actually gotten to the point where I'd actually created a plan, started writing suicide notes because I've never done well personally. A cell alone by myself locked down 24 hours a day.</br></br>

And that's exactly what it was,  24 hour day locked down in ad seg. You get- they were getting more programming than what we were getting. And we were just regular program inmates that had been classified and they got stuck over there with no program whatsoever.</br></br>

I ended up stuck in crisis bed myself for over a month and a half because they didn't know where they wanted to put me. The yard that I was on, A yard, the COVID cases were going crazy. And they didn't know what to do with people.</br></br>

So they were just moving people trying to create positive buildings and say “well half the building’s positive at the building’s not.” Problem is everybody shares a communal bathroom and there's only one bathroom with, you know, six toilets or eight toilets and nine sinks. Everybody has to use the same bathroom.</br></br>

So how do you put, you know, 75 negative people with 75 positive people and not expect the negative people not to get sick? Not gonna happen. And it just continued to grow.</br></br>

And then they started shipping people out of this facility up to San Quentin and Avenal. And then of course, the explosion happened at San Quentin with cases from the people that they sent here. It was just nothing but a series of moving people around.</br></br>

Trying whatever, like they just had no clue what they were doing. At this point, they're not doing so much of the moving but we do have 14 tents sitting in the middle of our yard. On a couple of key- on one occasion, we had a Santa Ana windstorm and many of those tents blew away.</br></br>

So they had to evacuate the people from those tents. And they got sent to another yard. Well they had to rebuild the tent city because the tents had actually literally blown away.</br></br>

So right now, they test us every week. This side of the yard that I’m on, I'm on the west side, we get tested every Tuesday. The four buildings over here and the tent city get tested every Tuesday, so we were tested today.</br></br>

We've all been on quarantine for the last few weeks. We've had a few cases- onesies twosies here and there. But for the most part, as of right now, it's pretty quiet.</br></br>

As far as cases go, we do have staff members that have started popping up sick, and two COs out in the tent city area within the last week came up sick. Supposedly our captain came up sick this week, a guy that goes around from yard to yard that does packages came up sick. So there have been staff members now starting to pop up sick.</br></br>

And of course, these staff members go to every building, regardless if you're on quarantine or not. So the chances of it spreading again are pretty high. There's a lot of us that still have never tested positive whether or not we've ever had it, we don't know.</br></br>

You know, in our current situation, of course, everybody's scared. And the buildings, they're starting to pack people back into here. So our population is upwards of 90 people.</br></br>

And they're starting to move people back into the buildings. So the closeness of our setting that we were in prior to the pandemic getting in here is being recreated, I have people all the way around me, right, left, within 42 inches of me. So there's no ability to social distance, there's no no ability whatsoever for them to do that.</br></br>

We're not provided hand sanitizer daily, we're not given the ability to- to sanitize our bunk area in our living spaces, because we're not given any of that type of stuff to be able to do that. We are given cloth masks. And honestly, pretty much, that's it, you know. The ability to social distance is non existent, you have to do temperature checks twice a day, but they make us line up.</br></br>

And of course, they tell you to crowd into a space that's, you know, should only house maybe 10 people and there's, you know, 60, 70 people crowded into a space to get your temperature check. So I feel like we're on the verge of another surge coming through here again. We know we're right there, we don't know when it's gonna happen.</br></br>

There's a lot of a lot of anxieties running high. We get threatened a lot. If you complain about this or that, like what I'm doing right now, that you're going to get moved to an ad seg yard or get moved to B yard where I got stuck back over the summertime, which ended up causing me to end up in a suicidal situation. So it's kind of it in a nutshell, our situation here.</br></br>

It's, it's a pretty scary situation for a lot of people. And of course, this yard is what they considered a high risk medical yard. So there was a lot of people here that that have already died.</br></br>

Because you have a lot of people with a lot of underlying conditions, especially older folks, including myself, I’m, you know, I'm in my early 50s, but I have asthma, COPD, high blood pressure, you know, some of those different types of things that put me at high risk. And you know, and there's been nothing being done to mitigate those types of circumstances.</br></br>

And we have people in our, their 70s and 80s in here that have all of those and more that are much worse off than I am as far as underlying conditions, and they're all- they're all just shoved in these spots. There's hardly anybody getting released from this facility to go home. I mean, it's very rare you see somebody go home, which you know, was kind of unexpected, with all the releases they were talking about, doesn't really seem to be happening here.</br></br>

So the population seems to be staying pretty much the same at this point. I know they lost their ADA accreditation for this yard. So they're going to be shipping a lot of the people in wheelchairs out because they can't keep them here because they don't have- this yard is not ADA compliant.</br></br>

So I know there's going to be some people leaving because of that. There's a- I'm personally I'm a transgender inmate, so aside from dealing with the COVID situation, we're still dealing with a lot of this stuff that relate to being trans as well. And and a lot of that being disregarded, especially treatment regarding trans individuals, medical treatment is being pushed to the backburner.</br></br>

We don't get any sort of regular treatment or the ability to see our doctor to have anything done or any adjustments made regarding the medically necessary treatment that we are supposed to have. I had to beg, beg them to finally even want to see me so I could get my mammogram done, which I'm way, way, way, way past due, you know those types of things. So yeah, I'm sorry.</br></br>

It's so hard to just- to do it justice without somebody being able to see it. Because if you could see a situation in which a lot of us are living- it’s scary. Everybody- I sit there every day and I wonder is today going to be the day that I get sick?</br></br> 

Because I worry, am I going to be the person that's next? Am I the person that's going to go out in an ambulance next? And am I ever going to see the people that I know and that I love again?</br></br>

You just don't know. Because there's nothing being done because they don't care. Even the staff members who are required to own certain PPE and wear masks- they're not doing it. They're not doing it.</br></br>

So and then, yeah, it's just really frustrating. And this environment, if you could see the inside of these buildings where we're living, you're like, it's it's no wonder that more of these people are not dead. It's amazing to me, this facility should have been shut down. And yet, here we are and now they're packing more people back into it.
