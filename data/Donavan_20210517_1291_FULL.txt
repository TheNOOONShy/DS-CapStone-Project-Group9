Hello,</br></br>
Since the beginning of the pandemic I have witnessed a failure to protect prisoners and correctional officers from COVID-19. We are housed in buildings with 200 or more prisoners breathing recycled air; making it impossible to practice or use 6ft social distancing to avoid catching and spreading COVID-19.</br></br>
I have witnessed the elders in their 50’s to late 70’s have their lives put in jeopardy by still being required to work in a workspace were they are in contact with correctional officers and free staff coming in from the outside. We are in so called quarantine but what good is it when the correctional officers and free staff are not in the quarantine with us? They go outside the facility and come back in, subjecting the prison to COVID-19.</br></br>
It is almost impossible to explain the depression and mental stress that comes with being in indoor facility where one unresponsible person can cause mass numbers of death …</br></br>
