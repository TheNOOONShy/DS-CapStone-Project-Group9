This story was told by a person incarcerated at Larry D. Smith Correctional Facility.</br></br>UCI: Great, so then, tell me what your experience has been like.</br></br>
Caller: Story would be too long anyway. I've been wearing my mask 24/7. And I asked whenever the Johnson & Johnson I'd take the shot, other than that I won't take it. And they finally got Johnson & Johnson in here and I got my shot.</br></br> But, I still wear my mask. You know, I'm going to hang up, they just told us to [unintelligible].</br></br>UCI: Oh, okay.Caller: Yeah, yeah, they're going to have us [unintelligible] here in a minute or two. They're [unintelligible].</br></br>UCI: Yeah, and then how many people would you say get vaccinated at your facility?</br></br>Caller: Almost everybody, I think. I don't know about the other ones, but we did here in our dorm. Unit housing one.</br></br>UCI: Do you see a lot of hesitancy with that?</br></br>Caller: Yeah, so when I was in there I saw seven counts of the virus. Seven different people from here. And I guess everybody's got shots now so it's a little better. And the guards have to wear a mask. Some of them wear them and some of them don't.</br></br> 
I don't know. I think they're the ones that's bringing the virus in. Anyway, I'm going to have to hang up because they're Ð maybe I can call back.</br></br>UCI: Yeah, absolutely. We'll be here until 9:00. Thank you so much.</br></br>Caller: You're welcome. Alright, bye-bye.</br></br>UCI: Bye.
