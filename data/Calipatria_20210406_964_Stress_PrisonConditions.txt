This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Calipatria.</br></br> 

Also with the COVID-19 it was a very bad time because our families weren’t working and couldn’t send their loved ones no money or packages. So it may be rough but thank God for our stimulus checks ‘cause that’s how we got our relief and made ends meet.</br></br>

But me, I’ve been coping with the COVID-19 pandemic by praying, working out, writing letters, staying positive with good thoughts. I couldn’t even go to my prop 57 board hearing due to the coronavirus.</br></br> 

It pushed it back a few months cause I’m prop 57. I go to board every year in September, so I got a letter from my board hearing lawyer.</br></br> 

So I will be going to board this September 2021. That’s on a Monday. So that and the fact that I already got my first and second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine and my stimulus check. Also meeting you was the best thing of this story being written.</br></br>

Well it has been a pleasure to have the time to write to you and to present my story to you in hope that it has enlightened you to the fullest. So that you could understand my feelings and emotions during the COVID-19 pandemic.
