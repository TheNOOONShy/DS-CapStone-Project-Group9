This story was told by a person incarcerated at Santa Clara Main Jail.</br></br>I was gonna say, have you, like, have you had any visits? Have you been able to see any family have you been in contact with anybody outside?</br></br>

Caller: My mother died, was unable to come because she got COVID. And she died while I was in here. And I had COVID. My sister came from Los Angeles and visited me twice. But I've tried to have my girl and a couple other people cleared for visiting.</br></br> 

But there's some asshole woman down there working to keep denying these people's visits, and they've been approved before. But now they got this new online application that they have to fill out. And if they don't remember, or if they've lost their passwords or their old emails or have new email, they won't they won't grant the visiting rights to come visit us.</br></br>So right now, there's probably about one person a week to get visits. Because nobody's been able to get approved for visiting because the lady that's working down there right now. And I don’t know why people have to come to work and act like that. They have to come here and be assholes.</br></br> 

It's not, it's not necessary. We're suffering enough here. I've been down for almost four and a half years straight. There’re people that have been here for nine years that want to see their family and they can't.</br></br> 

UCI: Yeah.</br></br> 

Caller: They're not being able to get cleared. You know, if you have an ID you don't have no warrant that should be sufficient.</br></br> 

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>

Caller: They have these policies and practices that they are enforcing that they're just not right.
