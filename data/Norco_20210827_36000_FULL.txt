This story was told by a person incarcerated at Norco.</br></br>

UCI: Okay, great. You can go ahead now.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah. So, my first question to you is, is somebody going to [unintelligible]?</br></br>

UCI: Is somebody going to what?</br></br>

Caller: Respond to the letter I wrote you guys.</br></br>

UCI: Yes. There is a letter writing team. They'll send–</br></br>

Caller: Okay.</br></br>

UCI: Probably send you a letter.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah. I just wanted to know that my letter was received and–</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>

Caller: That's it.</br></br>

UCI: I don't have–</br></br>

Caller: Go ahead.</br></br>

UCI: I'm not very sure when they will receive, but we always receive the letters. So, if that ease your worry.</br></br>

Caller: When did it start? When did this PrisonPandemic study start? Do you mind me asking?</br></br>

UCI: I'm not very sure because I just joined for a month. But I think it's last year.</br></br>

Caller: Okay, so it started last year. Yeah, so I'm at California Rehabilitation Center, supposedly the prison is on quarantine. [unintelligible] we have not received [unintelligible]. Everything is, like, on lockdown.</br></br> 

And I feel like, I don't know, like I'm being [unintelligible] to possibly being stuck here because of the COVID testing, COVID vaccine being pushed. It's kind of crazy right now.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm. What's the vaccination situation at your facility?</br></br>

Caller: The vaccination situation at my facility is they're offering the Johnson & Johnson, the Moderna, and that's it. If you want to get vaccinated [unintelligible] and take some precautions because [unintelligible] vaccinated. Yeah.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm. Do you know about the vaccination rate?</br></br>

Caller: I don't. I mean, I just know that I'm not vaccinated because I heard that there was not a lot of research about the vaccination. And like some of the vaccines have side effects.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>

Caller: I'm not trying to be sterile, damage my libido or have something happen to me just because [unintelligible] vaccination.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, I can understand your concern.</br></br>

Caller: I don't know if it's a righteous concern on my behalf. I don't know if I'm just maybe, like, being spooked, thinking that the government is going to put something in my body that hasn't even been properly tested to be approved.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>

Caller: I'm not really up on, like, you know, like, just something in my gut tells me to just hold off until things get more clear.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah. It's certainly righteous, I would say, since it's a new technique, technology, I mean.</br></br>

Caller: You get what I'm saying, right? Like, all of a sudden, it just popped up. And now it's like, "Okay, if you don't want– if you don't get this, you can do this or do that." [unintelligible] basically that you have no rights.</br></br>
We can't even get toothbrushes [unintelligible]. That's a hygiene standard, though. I should be able to brush my teeth. Hygiene affects people.</br></br>

UCI: Have you been infected?</br></br>

Caller: So, do you want to hear my COVID story?</br></br>

UCI: Say that again? Sorry, it was a little unstable.</br></br>

Caller: Sorry?</br></br>

UCI: It just went a little unstable before.</br></br>

Caller: It's stable.</br></br>

UCI: Can you hear me all right?</br></br>

Caller: The phone you're on is unstable?</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, your sound is like a little unstable. But it's back now.</br></br>

Caller: Can you hear me?</br></br>

UCI: Yeah. Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: Can you, do you want to hear my COVID story?</br></br>

UCI: Yes, yes, yes. Keep going.</br></br>

Caller: Okay. So, I was in prison, in Deuel Vocational Institute, which is a reception center, in 2019. In May of 2019, I went to ad seg. Do you know what ad seg is? It's a hole. It's Administrative Segregation.</br></br>

UCI: Okay.</br></br>

Caller: Are you following me?</br></br>

UCI: I've just, I've never heard of it.</br></br>

Caller: Okay. So, ad seg is like, when you get into trouble, you get into a fight, you go to the hole. You go to ad seg.</br></br>

UCI: Oh, okay.</br></br>

Caller: Can you hear me?</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, yeah, yeah.</br></br>

Caller: Okay. So, anyway. So, I go to ad seg. I'm in there, it's like May. It's around May, like May [redacted] I went to ad seg because I was involved in a riot, race riot, and [unintelligible]. And all of a sudden, I got, like, really sick, for like five to six days.I was just down and out.</br></br>

[unintelligible] just like, I had to have my celly, because we had cellmates, do everything. Answer the door, get our trays. And they have people that are mental health professional [unintelligible] that come around in there like, "Are you all right? Are you feeling all right? Do you feel like hurting yourself?" "No." "Do you hear voices?" "No."</br></br>

And like, my celly is at the door and I can't go to the door and look. [unintelligible] my celly and he's like, "Oh, he's just sick. He's sick." Long story short, I get called to medical one day. I never, I get called to medical one day. I never put in a medical request slip.</br></br>

And they're like, "Oh, so, we heard you came down with something." And I was like, "Yeah, I was really sick. But I didn't put in no medical request slip, so how did you even know I was sick?" Because I knew if I put in a medical request slip, it would take days for them to even see me. So, by the time I probably got seen, I would already be over what I thought was the flu.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>

Caller: And they were like, "Well, there's something going around. There's something going around and we're monitoring it." So, I believe that I caught COVID. I mean, it's called COVID-19 for a reason. It came out in 2019. I think I just, I got it.</br></br>

I don't know how. I was in ad seg. My celly didn't get it but I got it. Other people on the tier got it in other, random cells. So, I think I've been affected with COVID in 2019.</br></br>

I got out since then in 2020 and I didn't get it. Like, I was around it and I didn't catch it. But I've not been vaccinated.</br></br>

UCI: Was that 2020 May?

Caller: Was it in 2020 May? No, it was in 2019 May.</br></br>

UCI: Oh, 2019 May.</br></br>

Caller: Like May, June, July. Yeah.</br></br>

UCI: That was before the COVID-19 epidemic.</br></br>

Caller: Came out, right?</br></br>

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: But I swear I caught it, though. I experienced the symptoms. I'm Native American and I'm [unintelligible] Mexican. I don't ever get sick and I got sick like I've never been sick before. I had just taken the flu shot.</br></br>

UCI: Oh, what were your symptoms?</br></br>

Caller: I couldn't taste nothing, like food that I was eating. I was still eating. I couldn't taste nothing.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: I was fever, headache, sick, throwing up, diarrhea. Couldn't get up out of bed. Chest pains.</br></br>

Just felt like I, just sickness that you feel when you have never got sick in hella long and you're like, "I'm really sick. I can't wait until I'm better. I can't do nothing," type stuff.</br></br>

UCI: Those are all signature symptoms of COVID.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah. I think I caught it. I mean, I think I caught it before it even came out. Like, they knew, people knew what it was. They knew that I had [unintelligible] something.</br></br>
Like, they knew I was sick, but they didn't have this information, I think, at the time to label it. I'm pretty sure I caught it, though. Because I never recaught it. I've not been vaccinated.</br></br>

UCI: So, yeah, go ahead.</br></br>

Caller: What do you think? What's your opinion on it or what do think about that?</br></br>

UCI: About you just, about what you just said?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah.</br></br>

UCI: I don't know. I don't want to share conspiracies.</br></br>

Caller: There's hella people listening to me talk right now, huh?</br></br>

UCI: Especially when-</br></br> 

Caller: Is there hella people listening to me talk right now?</br></br>

UCI: I don't know. On our side, we're just recording. Hello?</br></br>

Caller: Oh, okay.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah. I think our call is ending. It says we're ending.</br></br>

UCI: Okay. Yeah, please. More poems.</br></br>

Caller: Write back. Can you guys please write back, though?</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, yeah, yeah. We will write back.</br></br>

Caller: Somebody? All right. Can I tell you what my poem is called so you know what my letter is?</br></br>

UCI: Can you tell me what?</br></br>

Caller: Can I just tell you what the title of my poem that I sent you guys is?</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, go ahead.</br></br>

Caller: It's called "A Description of Us." So, if you get that poem, then that's me. I wrote that poem.</br></br>
