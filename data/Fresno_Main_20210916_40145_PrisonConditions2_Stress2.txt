This story was told by a person incarcerated at Fresno County Jail.</br></br>

Caller: But what is for sure is that we're not getting help. So, that's a major concern. And I think that is also a violation of human rights, and - but we're working on it. It's not like anybody's doing it deliberately, and nobody cares. It's just that this quarantine and this pandemic has - is so new to mankind that there's nothing set in place.</br></br>

There's no, what you call, due process. You know? We haven't been to court, you know, for three weeks, close to a month. You know? And all of us missed our court dates. So, it's like, you know, it's overwhelming. However, we're dealing with it.</br></br>

And yeah. So, yeah, so the psychiatrists here are not doing, you know, anything to help us. So, that's a concern. And maybe that can change in the future or something, but right now, it's not. So, that's what I wanted to talk to you about because, you know, it's something that needs to be addressed.</br></br>

And a lot of us here don't have the appropriate education to address these matters. You know, most of us don't, 99 percent don't. I'm self, like, educated from all the years I've been in prison.</br></br>

I started reading at a very young age, and you know, so that's why I probably am a little more, you know, attuned to health, but I get overwhelmed because everybody wants me to do the grievances, and everybody wants me to do, you know, fight for their rights. And there's 44 people, and I can't do it for everybody. It's just overwhelming sometimes, you know? But I want to. I really care.</br></br>

So, everybody has their own issues. Everybody deals with this, you know, this quarantine differently. But for the most part, we miss our families. I don't have any family, so, but I know how it is to miss somebody.</br></br> 

You know, I know how it is to be lonely and, you know, afraid. And for the most part, that's whatâ€™s happening here.</br></br>

And dealing with fear, you know, with bad boys, is like, is not no easy walk in the park. You know, because you're dealing with these guys that can't, or are afraid to show any kind of fear. So, it's very unhealthy when you're afraid. You know what I mean?</br></br>
 
You're afraid to show fear? I mean, it's weird. You know? You're afraid, but you're a tough guy? You know what I'm saying?
