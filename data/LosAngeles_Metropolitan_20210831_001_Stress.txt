This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Metropolitan Detention Center.</br></br>

My safety feels jeopardized as I can be a target of bullying and abuse by other inmates and staff. This one staff accused me of something I never did. The correction officers are anti, mean, and abusive with right wing ways to eavesdrop on privacy and summon you for stupid shit. I keep in touch with loved ones via Corrlinks on the BOP system as they live in another place.</br></br>

It has been very difficult to cope emotionally and mentally. The place is full of selfish ignorant assholes who do not understand and constantly make fun of me at 32, like being in middle school. My case is ridiculous too so very little gain on the system.</br></br>

As for COVID, quite well was vaccinated in May of this year. I hope you can see it from my perspective how bitterly right wing and overwhelming the US system is for a minor case so common but picked on by the government. Constantly feel like life isn't worth living no more. It is hard and people started turning their back on me.</br></br>

With Asperger's, alienated, and depressed, it's just absurd for these "snowflakes" rich and snobby to see me suffer just for messages online especially to women. I hate California women unfortunately for this matter. In positive at least you are fed well and go outside in programs.</br></br>

Regards.</br></br>
