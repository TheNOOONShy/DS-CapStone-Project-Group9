This story was told by a person incarcerated at Chino.<br></br>

Caller: Yeah, basically, but like, you know, it's like for two weeks, two to three weeks, and once our two weeks are over and we test negative, they brought us back, they brought us right back to the place we caught COVID, and it was still spreading.</br></br> 
 
UCI: Gotcha. And because I am guessing they pretty couldn't catch you right on time when those that were already affected were infecting others right?</br></br>
 
Caller: Yeah.</br></br>
 
UCI: Gotcha. What about, like, what has it been like for you to have reduced visitation and programming?</br></br> 
 
Caller: There's like no programming, basically. They let us go to the yard like once a week. I think, like, that's how, it's inconsistent though.</br></br> 

It's very inconsistent and you know, it's just a lot of stuff that's lacking, you know. Oh yeah, it's like a lot, you know, time that we're supposed to get back. Like, you know, like how people get time for certain stuff taken off of their sentence.
