This story was told by a person incarcerated at San Joaquin County Jail.</br></br>


Caller:Now there I sat at this table full of men committed to their cause as they all follow the code of jail politics to the letter and actually take it very seriously whereas I am a man that had lived this lifetime of success and don't hold any value to their jail politics at all, nor will I ever. In the real world, I've been a boss now for over 15 years and my thoughts are if all you – if all you've ever done outside of jail is fail and live like a nobody and then you have to come to jail to puff out your chest and act like you're somebody by enforcing jail politics, well, then to me you're just a nobody squared now.</br></br>


You're a nobody personified and I don't take you seriously. As with my first time coming into this very pod unit that I'm in today where back in November I spent two months here, I ran into some trouble with the keyholder or pod boss for the lights as he kept trying to tell me what – what to do. The third time he attempted to enforce his jail politics on me, I snapped.</br></br>


I had been making late night phone calls regularly. I had done it at least ten times where with me – with me being up on the top tier, if you stay low enough to the ground, the CO down below on shift can't even see you. So when I needed to make a late night call at 1:00 or 2:00 in the morning, I would then sneak out of my cell and army crawl my way over the payphone and make some calls.</br></br>


Well, one time I got caught and then given a writeup and put on restriction as a result. And the next day, that pod boss wanted to hold a meeting with everyone out in the yard to inform me that this sort of thing could end up getting everybody to be restricted from it if they put the whole jail under lockdown because of it. But that was just his paranoia because they barely even gave me minimal restrictions and the COs weren't that mad when, in fact, some of them joked about how cool it was with me army crawling and all that. But I agreed and said I wouldn't do it again.</br></br>


So the next day I'm on the phone with one or two minutes left before the nightly lockdown trying to finish up my last thoughts when I hear him call down from below to me saying, hey, come on, hang up the phone. As I shook my head and gestured as to say one minute, well, he goes, okay, then we'll handle this in the yard tomorrow meaning he then wanted to have me beaten up the next day. Well, I slammed down the phone and called out in front of everybody saying, did you just threaten me?</br></br>


Because I'll come down – I'll come down there right now and knock your fucking teeth out. He quickly ran into his cell and closed the door and locked it behind him. The next day we held another yard meeting where it was explained to me he was a bit rattled – he was a bit rattled by me threatening him the night before. He then went on to tell me how I'd probably kick three or four of their asses at a time, but that's why he would put five or six dudes on me.</br></br>


I just laughed as I knew that with the fact that there were only 12 of us and the three biggest guys already now worked for me, that he didn't stand a chance at doing anything to me. I would easily cut my way through half his men while these other dudes on my team did the rest. Which is why he then went to – on to – to – which is why he then went on to whine about how he's in there fighting life sentence and if I did try to come and hurt him, he was prepared to just stab me.</br></br>


So I let him say his piece and told him that he had nothing to worry about, and I wouldn't hurt him, and we moved on. And later that day with the latest batch of [apple prune] not having been completed, he quickly ran straight up to me first handing me a big old goblet of drink as we all sat there and enjoyed our evening together, thus ending his official reign as pod boss and [unintelligible].</br></br>
