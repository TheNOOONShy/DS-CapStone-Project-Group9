This story was told by a person incarcerated at Los Angeles County Men’s Central Jail.</br></br>

UCI: What has the COVID situation been like at your facility?</br></br>

Caller: Like, like according to they give us masks and stuff like that or what, ma'am?</br></br>

UCI: Yeah. Anything related to COVID that you want to discuss is totally fine.</br></br>

Caller: Well, since like – like since, like since the COVID started, like I'm in high power. So they don't give us like masks. They only gave us those like once every two months, I think, in the beginning.</br></br> 

They didn't give us a mask until like three months after the COVID situation started. They didn't give us no cleaning material. They don't clean the housing unit we're in.</br></br>

Like they didn't come with the vaccine until like a week ago. And – what else – stuff like that. They don't let us – they don't let our family – well, they don't let me – my family – bring me masks because of my situation and my status in the county.</br></br>

UCI: Okay. And you said that you aren't able to get masks from your family members and they aren't providing them to you?</br></br>

Caller: No. Well, they do provide them sometimes. But, sometimes, they don't let us get em. Just because I got a different status in the county jail – just because I'm high power.</br></br>

UCI: Okay. And-</br></br>

Caller: So it depends on like – it depends on like, I guess – I mean I think because they discriminate us a lot. Because we're in high power, they really don't let – like your family could bring you masks. But, if they don't like you, then, you just can't get a mask in here.</br></br> 

And it's kind of hard. Because, if we get sick in here – and we're like in a - in a big pod – and people have got sick in here. And they really don't do nothing about it. And they just don't give us masks until we really ask them, but.</br></br>

UCI: And how has the COVID situation at your facility affected your loved ones?</br></br>

Caller: Oh, well, we can't get visits. We haven't got visits in over – going on like six – six – three months – going on six, three months. We don't get visits from our families.</br></br>

And, if they do, they got to get a vaccine to come first. But, even then, they don't - they don't allow our families to come in because of the COVID sometimes. So it kind of affects us pretty bad.</br></br>

UCI: And do the staff members wear the proper masks and protective gear?</br></br>

Caller: No. No. Not at all. Sometimes, they don't even wear gloves. Sometimes, they don't even wear their masks.</br></br>

When they handle like our food, sometimes, they don't even wear masks. They don't wear gloves, at times, and we ask them, "Hey, can you please wear a mask? Can you please put your gloves on?"</br></br>

They're like, "For what?" And I'm – for what? I mean, we're in a pandemic. I mean, we don't want to get sick.</br></br>

And they just start asking. And they just go on about their day. So there's really not much we can do.</br></br>

UCI: And what is it like in your facility, as far as visitation and programming? Do you guys still have full access?</br></br>

Caller: Well-</br></br>

UCI: Well, besides visitation, like you said-</br></br>

Caller: To be honest-</br></br> 

UCI: It's been cut off.</br></br>

Caller: To be honest with you, to me, I mean, other people have. But, with me, I don't – I haven't – I can't get visits or - or nothing like that. I don't get no privileges at all.</br></br> 

I haven't had my – I haven't had a visit since five years. So it's - I'm kind of different on that. I can't really - really answer that question.</br></br> 

I know other people that get visits right here. But I'm kind of more restricted program or stuff like that.</br></br>

UCI: Okay. I understand. And how have you been coping with the pandemic?</br></br>

Caller: How have I been cop- I mean it's kind of depressing. Because we can't really do much no more. We can't really go to a program. </br></br>

Or like – or get showers no more. We don't get disinfectant no more. They don't pass out disinfectant.</br></br>

So we have to clean ourselves. They don't give us shampoo like they used to before. It affects us real greatly.</br></br>

Because they don't give us as much stuff as they used to give us before – like hygiene material, disinfectant – all that. Which we should have coming. But they do not give it to us.</br></br>

UCI: And did that begin at the beginning of the pandemic or has that like started to happen in the middle?</br></br>

Caller: No. That's been going - no, that's been going on for years. But it got worser. It's been – now, they use that to their advantage because the pandemic, basically. So that – that like they see an excuse - an excuse for them to not give us what we got coming.</br></br>

UCI: So you feel like they're - they're withholding products from you?</br></br>

Caller: Well, yeah. They've been doing that for years. Because, like I said, I don't want to say my name. But it's because me and - me and another prisoner – we're like high profiles.</br></br>

And so they kind of treat us different. And they're - they say it's for their safety. But we don't - we don't do nothing. We're just regular inmates who want to get by.</br></br>

We want a mask, we want a mask. Why can't we get masks or why can't our family bring us masks but every other inmate could get a mask and their families could bring a mask. But, when it comes to two certain inmates, which is me and my neighbor, they don't allow us to get no disinfectant, no masks.</br></br>

They treat us totally different. And it's kind of like, oh, for – okay, for what? So they use the pandemic more as an excuse not to give us stuff that we got coming. So they do what - they do owe a lot of things to give us.</br></br>

UCI: Okay. And what would have made the situation at your facility better?</br></br>

Caller: If they were to give us more masks and actually give us like vaccines and stuff like that, where they'll come and actually ask us if we want to take the vaccine, instead of lying to us and say they come - they came to ask us.</br></br>

UCI: So you said that they aren't giving you proper – can you hear me?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah. Proper medical care. No, they're not.</br></br>

UCI: Okay. Can you repeat that last sentence?</br></br>

Caller: No, they're not giving us proper medical care. And they say that – they're not giving us proper medical care.</br></br>

UCI: Okay. I see. And-</br></br>

Caller: And it's only for the high power inmates. That's - that's only for high power inmates in L.A. County Jail, for like the general population high power inmates. They treat them differently than they treat everybody else, especially when it comes to us with the pandemic.</br></br>

UCI: Okay. And you said they - that they came about a week ago to administer vaccines?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah. Only to some of us, though, like only if you're high risk, not to everybody. So no, not for everybody, ma'am.</br></br>

They don't do that to everybody. They only do it to like – I guess they got a list or some kind of special list. I really don't know.</br></br>

They just come to a chosen few. And the rest, they don't even ask them if they got any symptoms or if they need disinfectant or - or hand sanitizer. They only – like there's about a hundred people in here.</br></br>

And they only gave like three, four people hand sanitizer. And that's it.</br></br>

UCI: And are they conducting any COVID tests or offering those?</br></br>

Caller: No. No, ma'am.</br></br>

UCI: So you guys are - are not aware of any COVID cases in your facility if they aren't conducting them?</br></br>

Caller: Oh, yeah. People – yeah – people – there's people that got sick in here. And I mean there's tests. But, like I said, it's like I guess it's a luck of a draw or something like that.</br></br>

I really don't know how the way they do their medical here. But they don't - they don't really care about us in here. And I'm trying to get our word out like so people can know just what's going on in this county jail is corrupted.</br></br>

And they don't care about us. They'd rather have us get sick or whatnot, and just tell us, "Oh, it's the flu. It's the regular flu,' while people have died in this county.</br></br>

But they don't put it on the news – over the COVID and got sick. And they just throw us back in the dorm. When someone gots COVID, instead of quarantine us, they throw us back in a module full of people.</br></br>

UCI: And do they offer any complaint system or like concerns or suggestions that you guys are able to voice to them?</br></br>

Caller: No, ma'am. Not at all, ma'am.</br></br>

UCI: Okay. And you said that people have died in your facility and they aren't reporting that?</br></br>

Caller: Yes, ma'am. They don't want it to get media coverage, basically. Because they want to make it seem like they - they come and they give us medical attention or they come and ask us like they said, on the news, one time, that they came to all of us and they asked us that if we wanted a test, if we wanted vaccines, if we wanted masks.</br></br> 

And most of us – I know I didn't get a mask. I know I didn't even get asked if I needed – if I had any symptoms. I didn't get tested or nothing. But, on the news, they said everybody was tested in that county jail, which was a lie.</br></br>

UCI: And how long ago did that happen, where you saw that media coverage that they said everyone was offered?</br></br>

Caller: That was like in the middle of the - of the virus, when it kicked off, like in the beginning, like two, three months after it kicked off.</br></br>

UCI: Okay. Well, is there anything else you want people to know about your experience?</br></br>

Caller: I mean, I mean I just – I'm just trying to put our word out there, that the way they're doing us in here is pretty bad – the way they treat us and every other inmate. It's kind of sad to me. But I got other people that could tell you stories about the COVID in here that have been through more, if that's what you would like.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah. That would be amazing if you could tell them to call us. We'd love to hear their stories and their experiences.</br></br>

Caller: And what do you guys - so what do you guys basically do? You guys post our stories? You guys post our stories or what?</br></br>

UCI: Yeah. So we have a website repository, where we take the audio calls from like calls like ours and we put them on the website so that people can hear, firsthand, from incarcerated individuals about what the experience is inside at this time. But we take out any identifiable material. So, that way, you know, we're protecting anyone that wants to call in.</br></br>

Caller: But what about if you don't want to be protected and you just want it – it should be out there?</br></br>

UCI: Right.</br></br>

Caller: You've caught the person on tape. What about the person don't want to be protected and he just wants it to be out there?</br></br>

UCI: Yeah. I wish that we were able to do that. There's tons of people that have told us that they wanted to put their name attached to their testimony. But, we, as a organization, with our university, we want to make sure that we're not making, you know, the lives of incarcerated individuals harder than they already are by potentially endangering them by attaching their name to their stories.</br></br>

Because these stories are very important to shedding light on what's happening in your guys's facilities. But we also don't want to cause any problems for anyone incarcerated that shares their story as well.</br></br>

Caller: And what makes you guys want to start doing it with us? Like what do you mean? Like do you guys just college or how did that come and – how did that become with us or-</br></br>

UCI: Yeah. So we have a few professors that work at the university, and - and grad students that put the team together to shed light on what's going on in the facilities. We know that incarcerated individuals deal with a lot of health problems as it is and that the facilities are not maintaining proper care for the incarcerated individuals.</br></br>

And it is a crisis. And we want to make sure that it is known to people. So, that way, the people that have the resources to be able to help out and make changes, systemically, baseline, any way that we can, we want that information to be out there.</br></br>

Caller: And are you a student yourself or you're a professor?</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, I'm a student.</br></br>

Caller: Oh, you're a student? Okay. Alright, then. And it was nice talking to you. And you have a nice day out there. Alright, ma'am?</br></br>

UCI: Yeah. Thank you very much for participating in Prison Pandemic. And stay healthy, please.</br></br>

Caller: Alright, then. Thank you. You have a good day.</br></br>

UCI: You, too. Bye-bye.
