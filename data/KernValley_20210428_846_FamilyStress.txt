This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Kern Valley.</br></br>

Now this time prison for has been so much pain and pain that I know these are years I will never get back and losing my sis really hit me the hardest, really made me see my life in a whole new way. Everyday that goes on in here is me getting myself to learn, educate my mind to know more than what I know.</br></br>

It is been so pain with all that has happen in my life and what's going on in the world right. I have been really getting myself ready for the real life. I have been put in this world to live. I understand it will get hard 'cause of my background and 'cause of where I will be coming out of.</br></br>

I know that there will be times where it will get hard and I know now that it's not bad to ask or get help 'cause two is better than one sometimes. I've learned to be humble, treat people right, and to never give up on my goals.</br></br>

That's why when I got your letter in this time of my life when all this that is going on in the world, I feel it's a sign that I can make the best of myself. And I don't need to live that gangster life anymore. Which I have done it already in here. Stop all that gang stuff and just be a real grown man in my life.</br></br>

Yes I'm in prison and still haven't left so it's tough cause things happen in here between inmates you know, politics of our gang lives. But I have been doing all the best to stay away from all that and just keep doing my program. Who knows, maybe all this program found me to help me with what I am going through right.</br></br>

I have lost family with all this pandemic and I know I will never see, or spend time with them, couldn't even say goodbye. It's really painful going through all this alone in here. But I feel that me being alone well in prison has impacted my life now much more because I don't blame anyone but myself for coming here right.</br></br>

I accept all the things that has happen to me right. But will I let that bring me down, no way! Now I will cut this here cause I'm running out of space right and if your project can send me writing stuff to me so I can keep writing I would highly appreciate.</br></br>

I do not ask family for anything 'cause they barely get by out there and I tend to not ask them for anything. I pretty much do everything here to get by while in prison. I draw for inmates and they pay me for it with things I need to get by and make my time go OK.
