Dear,</br></br>

Thanks for the random inquiry! As you will know, the pandemic has been depressing for a lot of us. While society underwent quarantine, sticking to one’s household, we at Richard J. Donovan Correctional Facility (RJD) were placed in the path of COVID-19, when the prison administration had chosen to designate a populated COVID-free housing unit as one of CDCR’s hubs for quarantining positive COVID cases.</br></br>

Consequently, guys from facilities within RJD, as well as other prisons, began to be transferred to Facility ‘A’, building one for quarantine. Although tags that read “QUARANTINE” were placed on the outside of the cell-doors, any attempts to prevent the infected from mingling with the remaining 70 plus groups who were not infected were futile, because those infected were served on the same food trays as everyone else, accessed the same phones, showers, and medication window.</br></br>

As one might imagine, it did not take long for COVID-19 to blow through the building like the deadly frigid williwaw it’s said to be. In its wake but a few were left without a shiver. Suddenly, guys in nearby housing units began falling ill – some to their demise. That was in November and December, 2020.</br></br>

Strangely, I was not afraid for self. Rather my concern has been for loved ones and the vulnerable. News programs presented blows of their own, compelling me to limit any intake of such.</br></br>

In February, 2021, vaccines were made available at RJD. Since that initial surge in positive cases, I have seen only three or four positives, as this building remains to be the hub. Perhaps it is only a matter of time before…. no, I will not speak that into the universe!</br></br>

Throughout the pandemic all rehabilitative programs have been cancelled. However, following widespread vaccination, some programs have resumed – with a reduced roster, of course. Having lost such programs for an entire year has been a setback, in light of personal goals based on a projected timetable, in hopes of an early parole.</br></br>

While phone calls have been a blessing, the cancellation of visiting has burdened me with loneliness that continues to poke my resolve, as I slosh through this quagmire. Relationships strained, attitudes are caught. I do not consider myself the mushy type, but a hug would be nice.</br></br>

I am enclosing a poem I’ve written concerning COVID; perhaps you could use it?</br></br>

Be well,</br></br>
