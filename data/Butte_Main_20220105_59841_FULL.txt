This story was told by a person incarcerated at Butte County Main Jail.</br></br>

UCI: What has the COVID situation been like at your facility?</br></br>

Caller: At first it was kind of, it was alright, they was allowing like, free calls and stuff, you know what I mean, we were able to contact our family. But then they took the calls away and shit. I currently like, I currently lost one of my cousins over the COVID flu. You know, it’s kind of depressing.</br></br>

They got us locked down, we're locked down like 22 hours a day. We ain’t getting really no phone calls or nothing, or really nothing really special here, you know? It’s kind of like making us act out and stuff, you know?</br></br>

UCI: Act out? Can you elaborate on that? What do you mean by act out?</br></br>

Caller: Like, you know what I mean, well we’re just bored, you know what I mean? So, you know what I mean? There’s like, we’re on a standstill, there ain't a lot of like, movement in here, you know what I mean. There’s a lot of assault on inmates, there’s - you know what I mean, assault on staffs. Shit like that.</br></br>

UCI: How is the staff taking care of you guys?</br></br>

Caller: They don’t really care. They don’t seem like they got any kind of like, empathy or anything, you know?</br></br>

UCI: Even the medical staff?</br></br>

Caller: Like, even medical staff. The medical here sucks bad.</br></br>

UCI: Oh. As in what way?</br></br>

Caller: Like - like, just as far as like, our medical like, for - for like measures, you know? I wear eyeglasses, I wear prescription eyeglasses. I’ve been here for four months and I can’t get an optometry appointment.</br></br>

UCI: Wow.</br></br>

Caller: You know, and I can’t see shit. You know what I mean? So, you know, there’s only so much to do ‘cause I don’t got medical insurance that'll pay for optometry. Like, I can’t see the TV from my cell. I can’t read a book because I can’t see shit. You know? They don’t care.</br></br>

UCI: How has the vaccination situation been like?</br></br>

Caller: I got the vaccination. I got the one where you only need one shot. I got it.</br></br>

UCI: Oh, the Johnson & Johnson one?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah. I got that one.</br></br>

UCI: What happens if an inmate says that they have COVID? How does the medical team respond to that?</br></br>

Caller: They - they will give, they will give you like, cotton swabs, you know what I mean? They’ll give you the COVID test. They really don’t, they really don’t give a shit about us. You know? Life's cheap in here, to be honest with you.</br></br>

UCI: Cheap as in?</br></br>

Caller: Cheap as like, they don’t give a shit.</br></br>

UCI: I get you. How has the COVID situation at your facility affected your loved ones?</br></br>

Caller: It’s - it’s getting better, ‘cause now they can come and see us. But for like, for example, like in the beginning of this, they didn’t even have visits until like, until like September of this year. From beginning of last year all the way until September, this facility didn’t allow no visits.</br></br>

UCI: Was there a reason why for that? That's a pretty long time.</br></br>

Caller: They said because of COVID, they didn’t want their staff to get infected by it. But, they allowed us two free phone calls a week.</br></br>

UCI: You think that they’re gonna cut you off again since this new variant is starting to pick up?</br></br>

Caller: I think so. I do think so, and it’s kind of scary. You know what I mean? I can’t even get out to get a fucking eye doctor’s appointment. It’s kind of, it’s a little bit scary.</br></br>

UCI: How have you been coping with the crisis?</br></br>

Caller: I been coping, I just been - I work out a lot, you know what I mean? I try to stay focused, you know, like I said I can’t read or write so you know, I try to stay doing cardio. You know, interacting, playing a little bit of cards when I can. You know, just staying active so I don’t lose my bearings, you know?</br></br>

UCI: Do they let you go outside like, a couple hours a day? Or is it like–</br></br>
 
Caller: We’re only out of our cell for two hours a day. We’re locked down 22 hours a day, and like while we’re in our day room, we could either shower and use the phone, or we can go outside for an hour, and use the phone and shower for an hour. So they kind of like got us on zero movement.</br></br>

UCI: Wow. </br></br>

Caller: We’re maximum custody inmates.</br></br>

UCI: Even though it’s a county jail?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, even though it’s a county jail. We’re like, we’re high risk.</br></br>

UCI: Wow.</br></br>

Caller: We’re pretty much in our cell all day long.</br></br>
 
UCI:  That must be-</br></br>

Caller: This phone call is actually kind of cool.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, it is. It’s a good way to get your voice - your stories heard, ‘cause that’s serious. Like, you’re in your cell for 22 hours a day?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, 22 hours a day.</br></br>

UCI: And I thought quarantine back home was terrible. Being at home all day. I can’t imagine being in your cell.</br></br>

Caller: We’re basically in a box. Inside of a box.</br></br>

UCI: What would you have made your situation, your facility better? Like, what would you suggest to make it better?</br></br>

Caller: Well what I would suggest like, maybe if they offered us like, you know what I mean, a little bit more board games, you know what I mean? Maybe even a tablet, you know? ‘Cause there’s other facilities that got tablets and stuff.</br></br>

Like a tablet so we could maybe like, email our family, or maybe even take some online classes. Shit like that would be cool you know. We could be earning degrees or maybe even a GED if you don’t got one, you know?</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, I get you. Or even like, for example, like with the quarantine and everything, people transitioning over to zoom. Like you could- would be able to zoom to your families too, instead of having to call.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, that would be fucking, that’d be awesome. You know? Or even like in prison, they got them to like, you can get like, three-minute, like little video clips, you know what I mean? We can’t send them back on our part, but like we can get little three minute video clips from our family, you know?</br></br>

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: ‘Cause like, if we send them an email, they’ll get it like, three minutes after you send it, you know what I mean? It’s not like, texting or nothing, but it’s still better than having to wait three days to hear from your family.</br></br>

UCI: That’s - that’s terrible that you have to wait that long. Well, is there anything else that you want people to know about your experience?</br></br>

Caller: Just like, you know, just if they got somebody incarcerated, you know what I mean, letters help a lot. You know what I’m saying? Letters help a hell of a lot, correspondence it does miracles. You know? A letter will warm somebody’s fucking day, you know, a lot.</br></br>

UCI: How about your like, your what’s it called, the staff that work there. How have, like, have they just been treating you poorly?</br></br>

Caller: Well, you know, it’s like, a lot of them, a lot of them are just – they just treat us like bottom of the barrel people. You know? They don’t care about our medical needs, you know. The medical, this is the worst place I have ever been for medical.</br></br>

UCI: Wow. Wow. Even during a pandemic, too. That’s pretty scary.</br></br>

Caller: Even with the epidemic, say like, I put in a medical – put in a sick slip – and they won't even come and see me until next week.</br></br>

UCI: Wow.</br></br> 

Caller: Takes seven days – it takes anywhere from seven to nine days for them to see you medically.</br></br>

UCI: Seven days. That’s like, how it typically is for everyone?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah.</br></br>

UCI: Wow. That’s pretty scary. Let’s see. So what has it been like for you to have reduced visitation and programming at your county jail?</br></br>

Caller: Well, it’s just, you know what I mean, a lot of us take different, you know what I mean? They take our visits and like, our programs and stuff away. We just, we make ourselves not bored. We start wildin' out.</br></br>

UCI: Is there any like, conflicts between you and the other prisoners?</br></br>

Caller: And the other prisoners? Yeah, like I got, for example, right now, I got ten batteries on inmates.</br></br>

UCI: Wow. That’s crazy.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, it’s crazy. It’s like, when our doors open, we never know what’s expecting. You know what I mean? You don’t know what the next person is going through, you know what I mean? ‘Cause to be honest with you when your doors open up, like, you could feel it, it’s eerie. It’s eerie, you know?</br></br>

UCI: Yeah. Yeah, I get you. Wow.</br></br>

Caller: Like, fight or flight thing. If you ain’t at the top of the food chain, you probably gonna get fucking sent out of here.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, I get you, I get you. That’s funny. Is there anything else you would like to add about like, the pandemic and your county jail specifically?</br></br>

Caller: No. I just wish, you know what I mean, I pray that everybody’s family is alright. That their situations and their loved ones are taken care of, and you know, and that’s all.</br></br>

UCI: Okay. Let’s see. Well, I don’t have anymore questions to ask, so if you would like to talk about anything like, related to the pandemic, you can go ahead and talk.</br></br>

Caller: I just, you know what I mean, I wish, you know what I mean, I’ve seen a lot of people – I’ve seen a couple people’s grandparents die and, you know what I mean? I know what it's like for the elders and the little ones the most, so I just, you know, hope that people are taking the right precautions, you know? And if they do come in contact with it, they stay away from their family. You know?</br></br>

UCI: Yeah. That’s the most important thing. What do they do to like, prisoners that get COVID? Do they isolate them, or are they still–</br></br>

Caller: They isolate them. They isolate them away from us. There’s been a couple people that – I think there’s been two people that died right here in infirmary.</br></br>

UCI: That died in their cell?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, in the jail.</br></br>

UCI: And how did they take care of that?</br></br>

Caller: I don’t know. They just, they left and never came back.</br></br>

UCI: Oh wow. That’s, wow. Let’s see.</br></br>

Caller: We appreciate this phone service too, you know what I mean, it was cool that you guys took the time out to reach out, know what I mean, the letter, you know? It was cool. Thank you guys.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, we would, yeah - I mean, we want you guys to be heard. We want better situations for everyone in prisons, especially during this pandemic. I know it could be like, really tough, you know? You guys are already kept in confinement, like, even with this, like pandemic, now you guys are kept into like, more confinement.</br></br>

I didn’t even like, the fact that you guys have to stay like 22 hours in just in your cell, alone. Like that could, that could take a toll on a lot of people and, you know, some people, they struggle with finding ways to cope with that kind of stuff.</br></br>

And it could lead to like, a lot of violent or like, horrible things. You know what I mean?</br></br>

Caller: Oh yeah, believe me. Like, there’s probably about like, anywhere from like, probably seven to nine assault and batteries on inmates a month here, easy. Easy.</br></br>

UCI: And what are they usually about? Is it usually about like, related to COVID?</br></br>

Caller: No, it’s usually about like, you know what I mean, somebody will get loud, like in their cell or disrespect somebody on the tier. And like, if that happens, we gotta deal with it.</br></br>

UCI: That’s crazy.</br></br>

Caller: They’ll be like, “Hey, my favorite color is fucking purple.” And the dude be like, “My favorite color is black. And fuck it now you disrespected me, now I’m beating you up.”</br></br>

UCI: Well, I thank you very much for participating in this PrisonPandemic project. Please consider telling your friends about us and seeing if they would like to call in. This line is usually open five to nine, Monday through Friday. So in case they ask, just tell them that.</br></br> 

Caller: Well, we only get out of our cell one week, and that’s today. From five to nine – from this time. So, we might call back. I’ll give the number out so you can hear these guys stories too.</br></br>

UCI: Alright, thank you man. I appreciate listening to your story. That truly - I really feel bad for you.</br></br>

Caller: Thank you guys, you guys have a nice day?</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, you too. Take care.
