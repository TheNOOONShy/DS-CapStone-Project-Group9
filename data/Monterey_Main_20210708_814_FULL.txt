This story was told by a person incarcerated at Montery County Correctional Facility.</br></br>

UCI: Great. So then tell me about your experience.</br></br>

Caller: So, my experience is this, and you probably won't believe me. I'm special operations ex-director for Central Intelligence Agency. I've run a taskforce that tries to stop cartels from bringing in black tar heroin and fentanyl.</br></br>

And I operate - I don't know how you -- we call ourselves Christians in Action. And my former girlfriend developed the inventory control system for CIA and worked on recovery of the State Department diplomatic security, which is a front for the CIA.</br></br>

The CIA is not what you picture it. It's a bunch of freelance people that run different operations. I'm not an employee. I'm not enlisted in the Marine Corps, but I got highly involved urban survival training, which is basically--</br></br>

You could drop me off anywhere in the country, particularly if it's not cold. I'll get free food. I'll get whatever I need. And I have access to a lot of money anyway through my own activities.</br></br>

I'm one of the top solar financing energy efficiency experts in the world. And also spent the last 10 or 15 years, and you'll laugh, it sounds like I has a sugar daddy. Now I'm deep three.</br></br>

I don't know, spiritual. I want to fall in love and have children again. And right now, I don't know if you follow the news at all. But if you follow the news, we're having an incredible drought on the West Coast.</br></br>

We're having a lot of weather events. And it's no accident. It's not man-made. It's not like somebody's sitting in the control room manipulating the weather. I mean, what do you think about what's going on in the world?</br></br>

I know with COVID, how many deaths do we have? Six-hundred thousand? And there's biblical stuff happening out there. I mean, do you have any thoughts about that, as a young lady going to college?</br></br>

UCI: Yeah. I mean it's very interesting. And there's, you know, a lot of different opinions, like you have. And a lot of different perspectives and different backgrounds. And so I think it's just very eye-opening.</br></br>

But it's also very eye-opening for, you know, the prison and jail systems, just how much those need to be fixed. And you know, I'm sure you've experienced a lot of issues in your profession, trying to get help during COVID because of the restrictions?</br></br>

Caller: Sure. So, yeah, you want me to discuss that?</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, what has it been like for you?</br></br>

Caller: Well, what's up with Monterey County is a county that is very punitive. A lot of counties are letting people out of jail. I have what's called felony evasion charges, which means I had a panic attack and led the Highway Patrol on a chase.</br></br>

And they're not very good drivers. So they pursue people and are run by their male egos, which are bigger than their brains, which are generally pretty small and Pavlovian like a dog.</br></br>

So, unfortunately, I had a relationship come on a positive sum. I prefer the women, agent. I mean, how to control me, because they're a lot more intelligent.</br></br>

Plus I just love women anyway. And I'm a goddess first and third and Wiccan, Celtic, Druid, Christian, ancient ways you know. You might want to write this down.</br></br>

You might want to look up [redacted], who runs this Goddess Temple in [redacted]. She's quite interesting. A master teacher of the mystery school.</br></br>

And what I did is about, I don't know, 10 years ago, I decided to do conscious speaker-hood. But it's been a long time since I communicated, it's psychology or a human experiment where I could see whether I could use Shamanic training and magic to manifest in the real world.</br></br>

And what happened was, it's like they're just experiments. And someone had to do, you locate in Southern California and you're looking out across the beach in Santa Monica. There's a two-story townhouse and meeting some celebrities and then hanging out at Perry's Pizza, which is a hooker bar.</br></br>

And then also playing around with Seeking Arrangement dot com and having different beautiful, loving relationships, because I'm stupid. I fall in love with people. And they made you smart sex for that.</br></br>

To me, I always treated women with an incredible amount of respect. To be raised by a single mother, that sort of perspective. People go, you're a player. And no, I'm not a player. I'm a lover.</br></br>

So, anyway, what's happening -- when I did this experiment, it had very unusual results. Which is when you operate in the realm of spirit, you know, Christian world calls it the Holy Spirit or the Holy Ghost. And I call it magical. Or the angelic realm.</br></br>

You also are in the 3D realm. And unfortunately, there's people out there that are not your friends. And when you're fighting for the good side, which is human freedom.</br></br>

Freedom from slavery, particularly women or men that would be addicted to drugs and then forced into sexual slavery. Most of them want to be, I hate to say it. Like prostitutes or whatever, you know, high priestess or--</br></br>

But for some there's a common gypsies. That there's groups out there of men and women who will travel around or be in a community. And I'm not saying any racial bias.</br></br>

It might be living in public housing. It could be a welfare mother or father or whatever. And they pimped out their own teenage children, who were more than willing to be pimped out as prostitutes, because they get all the good toys or whatever. And they like getting their mama or sister better.</br></br>

There's some that are homeless people that come through or come along and pick up somebody in that manner. A woman, 16, 17, 18, 19. Gave them a place to stay in a motel. Then try to turn them into prostitutes.</br></br>

And I find that to be very disgusting. And I've helped free some people from that out in Ventura. There's a young lady that I mentioned where that was the situation. I pulled in this motel, probably a 25-room single motel that I'm going to give you some clues.</br></br>

It was owned by an Indian family. The father was an English professor in India, and the daughter worked but she self-served as a student. And this dude pulls in in a pickup truck with these two people and wanted this young lady.</br></br>

He basically says, she wants to escape from him. So, I was leaving town and I just gave her some money and said, "Look, get away from him," which she did.</br></br>

And I've run into this all over the state. And the gypsies, I call them, those fortune tellers that have the palm-reading, the fortune telling, they will elder abuse people.</br></br>

Find unfortunate people, women, men, whatever, who are going through trouble. And then suddenly they brainwash them and do their fortunes. And people are susceptible.</br></br>

Before you know it, they might be giving up the title to their home, their retirement, their entire life savings. And it's a horrible, horrible thing and it's out there.</br></br>

I mean that's why right now we're going through kind of a battle between good and evil. You live in an enchanted place. I guess you go to UC Irvine, is that right?</br></br>

UCI: I do, yeah.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah. So, keep the names out. So, you know the history of UC Irvine is the general Irvine Smith. Her -- they developed the Irvine Ranch. And she's still alive, I think.</br></br>

They ended up giving all the land to UC Irvine to start that university. And there's a dude that's around, I don't know who -- Do you ever hear of Morton Irvine Smith? He's like the black sheep of the family.</br></br>

He's a friend of mine. And he's around. It's a little unusual. But after the family declined UC Irvine. And my relationship with UC Irvine is this. You have like the Water Technology School, am I correct?</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, mhm.</br></br>

Caller: And then you have the National Water Policy Institute, which is funded by the Irvine family. So, you might pass the word. There's a company called Sky H2O, of which I was one of the founders, and helped Alex von Welczeck, he's the CEO.</br></br>

Develop all his relationships up in the Middle East and in China. Let me just tell you about him real quickly. What's gonna happen to him.</br></br>

He got money from Saudi Arabia, and he got money from a guy in San Antonio, Texas. And Galvan's like an old, old Texas family. My family over in the cistrines are one of the wealthiest Jewish families in the United States. And I'm from that world.</br></br>

So, you know, Alex took 500,000 or 700,000 of the investor money and he spent it on prostitutes and escorts and buying them gifts, taking them out to dinner and entertaining. Which I don't judge him, but don't do it with investor money.</br></br>

And then he traveled around the world. And he got involved with money-laundering and all kinds of scams. And unfortunately, he did a stupid thing. He abandoned his wife, who's a tall, kind of strong lady from Germany.</br></br>

He has a beautiful, gorgeous daughter. I mean who I'm in love with since she was 18, but I stay away from her because, you know, it's my friend's daughter.</br></br>

And he abandoned them. And then he married this woman who's named [redacted], who has a 12- or 13-year-old son. It's cool. She's the most beautiful - looks like a Vogue model.</br></br>

But she's the former wife to oligarchs. And she ran -- she's a lawyer -- and she ran junkets for these oligarchs and the wealthiest people in Europe on a private island. I guarantee you a lot of drugs. And she was a teenage pop star, and she was a teenage porn star and prostitute.</br></br>

So, they're going down. I'm not gonna allow my good name and my family name, which is fifth-generation military and public service, to be besmirched by somebody that's ripping off money and spending it on prostitutes.</br></br>

Which I'm not judging him for that, but don't do it with -- do it with your own money. You want to see escorts? Don't use investor money, particularly from the families.</br></br>

They will -- if they catch him doing that and he's in Europe, in Saudi Arabia, he'll just disappear, you know? And I don't want that on the guy.</br></br>

But I'm basically gonna break this thing up. I'll turn him into the IRS and the FBI and a bunch of agencies in writing. And you'd better warn the people in your school, because the guy that's to roll has worked with UC Irvine, this guy is a greasy guy. He looks--</br></br>

And I don't -- truly sad -- because he has some really great qualities as a human being. But I'm not gonna let him do that to the investors. Because I feel bad for them, and socially responsible investing movement between all these sponsors--</br></br>

And there's a woman, and she was in graduate school when I met her through the Vanberg Foundation, because I inherited a couple million, which today would be like $25 million today at present value. And now she manages, you know, like $8 billion.</br></br>

And you as a college student, you sound like a wonderful individual. I'm not trying to like be anything naughty with you. But you know, you have so much potential in your life.</br></br>

Being a college student and working with Professor. She must be an amazing person. I would love the Prison Pandemic project to develop a relationship with the ACLU, with some other groups that actually help prisoners and get some money to do that. And you college students communicate like be a pen pal with some prisoners.</br></br>

And you have people like me. I'm very sickly. I mean I know Elon Musk. I know Zuckerberg. I know all these people. But stupidly that panic attack, so I'm stuck in jail with a mental health hold, and I'm resolving my issues.</br></br>

But these men that are in here, they're dying for some communications. Not everybody has family, you know? That they -- a lot of them do, but, you know, I don't.</br></br>

And now right around here where I have my cousins. I can't seem to get ahold of them. So you just deal with it.</br></br>

Being in jail is a very odd thing, because you develop male camaraderie. And as long as you follow the rules and don't, you know, pay attention to the people who have been here will tell you, "Don't do this, don't do that," and they'll guide you around, you won't have a problem.</br></br>

But if you're a punk and you complain or you snitch, and stupid, you might get beat up. But it's very rare. And -- but it's also stressful. I haven't had - I've had some really heavy people, and I haven't really had any physical issues.</br></br>

I have psychological issues with people. They try to bully you a little bit or rather -- but, ultimately, what happens with me is since I have deep faith -- And you may laugh.</br></br>

Part of the Central Intelligence Agency taskforce would also, there's a lot of Hispanic people from cartels. And I met Pablo Escobar's nephew here -- Escobar. And I call up the mont.</br></br>

So I'm like the -- the -- I consider myself to be an ambassador between the U.S. government and all the street gangs of the world. And jail is a good place to meet some of them, you know? But I know the people are with Cali Cartel and Bedouin Cartel.</br></br>

Read a book called "The Invisible Empire." It basically says that the cartels run the world, along with the intelligence agencies, because they work with the cartels. And the U.S. government doesn't.</br></br>

Although obviously, the American president and Kamala Harris, you know, they -- and I know the president's brother Frank, he's involved in trying to provide solar for schools, 25,000 schools in Costa Rica.</br></br>

And I'm like, wow, that's a nice project. So I helped him out. What's your major, if can ask?</br></br>

UCI: Sure, yeah. It's psychology.</br></br>

Caller: Oh, really.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: You're undergraduate, I guess, huh?</br></br>

UCI: Yes, I am. Mhm. You mentioned that you've had -- you know, there hasn't been a lot of like visitation during the pandemic. What -- how have you been able to cope?</br></br>

Caller: Well, if I could get organized enough to get my friends and people to sign on to the GettingOutOfJail.com or whatever it is, then they could download the app and do it.</br></br>

But so far, one of my -- one of my best friends stupidly went through a divorce, right? They're like an idiot. He decides to be a bully and he wanted his daughter to stay in New York so badly because that wouldn't allow his wife and daughter to move to Montclair, California.</br></br>

So the end result is $800,000 in legal bills later, his daughter hates his guts and he'll probably lose total control.</br></br>

Anyway, and he's depressed. And then when you tell people the truth, sometimes they hate you. They can't handle the truth. They would rather be delusional.</br></br>

And as a psychologist, I don't know, you'll figure out where that boundary is. But it's interesting. If you were to look up obituary in 1992, you'd see my mom.</br></br>

She was one of the best psychotherapists on the planet, and also was appointed by the courts of New York City to protect against elder abuse.</br></br>

So, hoping for me, and other people in here do the video calls like my, I have this great friend in LA and he's fantastic and he's local. And he knows his way around the whole system, so he gives me good advice and--</br></br>

But the other things that I do, I meet people. So there's one -- we're in what's called the B wing. I'm going to go over -- and there's the tank 1, tank 2, and tank 3. And I loved it better when I had a cell, had six windows, my own private cell.</br></br>

But I didn't get out as much, and I looked out my window and there were foxes, three kit foxes. And the birds that would sing to me. And then, you'll laugh.</br></br>

There was the ground squirrels all over these hills outside my cell, and I would throw my little carrots out and feed them.</br></br>

And then I'd see these little guys out going, "Num, num, num," eating their little carrots. So, I prefer nature unless I'm with a beautiful woman. And you know, entertaining or making love, or whatever.</br></br>

I'd rather just be with nature and be by myself. Because human beings are stupid animals. Anyway, I may write you a letter. If -- would you get it if I sent it?</br></br>

UCI: So, I wouldn't personally get it. We have a team that reads all our letters. But yeah, we're happy to take any letters, too. And if you -- </br></br>

Caller: So, here's what I'm gonna tell you. Look up on LinkedIn, [redacted]. I know that's a friend of mine, that's me, at Solar Finance Corporation. And look under The Goddess Temple.</br></br>

And I'll pray for you merely because you have no idea you're about to head into the biggest career disaster. I've been around for many decades. And the entire United States is about to blow apart.</br></br>

I wouldn't be surprised if we had war, armed conflict in Middle East. You'd better get your survival skills and your go bag ready. Because if you want to survive, you'd better be ready to survive. And organize some of your friends.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: And have backup fuel and other things.
