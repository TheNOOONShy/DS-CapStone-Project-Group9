This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Solano.</br></br>

OK here's your questions, “What has it been like to be inside during this time”? Well it’s been very tough on me and my family. I only got to see my son one time the whole seven years I’ve been away. It was a combo of COVID-19 and CDCR moving me around to different prisons.</br></br> 

I started in SQSP then to Ironwood, Arizona, Mississippi then back to Arizona, Shafter, PVSP and now Solano. And almost as soon as I got back up north COVID-19 hit the U.S. hard, we got put on lock down when I was planning to see my son and sisters. And there’s also just being stuck without programs to help us re-inter society.</br></br>

“How do you feel about your safety inside”? Well that’s a good question, the officials that run this prison do not know what they’re doing. They’re moving people around too much and because of it hundreds have caught COVID-19 in this prison myself included. It’s a terrible sickness.</br></br> 

I was down for close to a month and I’m young and healthy. They’re also getting false positives and just throwing them with people who really got it. That’s exactly how I got it. I wasn’t sick till they put me with the rest of the positive men.</br></br>

They packed us all in a dirty gym, then they started kicking people out after a week, way too soon. And they also started sending those men to buildings that had no positive cases till they did just that. Another thing, this is not coming from my-mouth cause I’m sure they’ll be reading this before it goes out and I don’t want to get in-trouble cause I’m close to going home.</br></br>

But people are saying that the CO’s are sending inmates that give them trouble to contaminated areas as punishment. Now I’m being very clear when I say this there are great CO’s that work here but there's also the bad apples.
