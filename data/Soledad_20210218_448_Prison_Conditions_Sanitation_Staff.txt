Theme: Prison Conditions: Sanitation and staff


For example, as soon as it was recommended by the CDC that people wear misks, within a reasonable amount of time, the prison issued us cloth masks that the inmates in Prison lndustry Authority (PIA) a.k.a modem-day slavery, sewed up for us to wear. There still was no known case here yet. Even though it was mandatory for all inmates and staff to wear masks, many staff scoffed at wearing them and inmates wearing them was not enforced.</br></br>
Another example, it was known very early on that this virus was transmittable via dogs and cats, at least as carriers. The facility I am on has a service dog program. But because some staff here are involved with the entity that provides the dogs, possibly monetarily, and the fact that the program makes the prison look good, [lip stick on a pig?] the dog program continued for weeks possibly months rotating the dogs in and out of the prison to the public. The dogs reside here with their handlers all week and then are picked up by the K9s for Life entity that provides them or correctional staff for weekend public outings. Then after a weekend of licking, sniIling, eating, petting, rolling in contaigonville, the dogs were brought back here to the isolated inmate population. The staff were going to get those feathers in their hats, deadly global pandemic be damned. They still are taking the dogs in and out!</br></br>


Next, at first when the cases started exploding in here, it was on a different facility. CTF North is comprised of North, South, and Central facilities. The virus was spreading through Central facility. Not attached to us. No problem. Wrong! Staff from over there would and currently still are working overtime between yards. Yes, that's right.</br></br>
Before there was a single inmate case in North facility, staff working over at the known to be infected Central facility, would work their shift over there in the hot zone, and then come pull a shift over here on North facility that was still infection free! This policy was questioned by me personally and by some staff. Answer: the guards union says you cannot deny an officer the "right" to get some overtime pay. Gotta make that money, right?!</br></br>
