This story was told by a person incarcerated at Chuckawalla.</br></br>UCI: This all sounds extremely scary and stressful. How are you coping with all of this?</br></br>  Caller: Honestly, just one day at a time. I mean for me personally it’s been three weeks since I had contracted the COVID-19.</br></br>  UCI: Okay.</br></br>  Caller: It really took me about two weeks, to kind of regain a little bit of my sense of self, physically and mentally and spiritually. So it's just a slow struggle of just trying to come to terms with, how foolish of errors they made across all this stuff. And basically just trying to hope that they don’t continue making more silly moves that will continue to, you know, damage us or cause any more harm essentially.</br></br>  UCI: Yeah. Would you say that, you know, this sickness and even deaths and, in your case, were- could it have been prevented perhaps?</br></br>  Caller: Some of it could have been prevented, absolutely. You know, if they had responded quicker. In some cases, you know, some people reported that they were not doing as well, and they still continued to avoid taking them to the hospital. They did whatever they could to try to keep them here and avoid a hospital stay. Cause, you know, hospital stay is too expensive for them.</br></br>  UCI: Yeah.</br></br>  Caller: And yeah, you know, for some of these guys it was too late. By the time they actually responded and got them to the hospital, they were pretty much goners for the most part.
