Greetings UCI Student,</br></br>

First and foremost, I hope you're keeping safe and remaining healthy. We'll get through this hard time together. I'm in a good solitary confinement, in a minimum-security level yard, it's not so bad. I'm happy to received your letter. Wow! UCI student, cool!!!</br></br>

Ever since the spread of the coronavirus started in this prison there were many concerns and changes. The virus affected correctional officers, staff members, and prisoners. More than 300 who are 65 and older have health problems were transferred to other prisons. San Quentin is one of the prison that many were shipped to, and the numbers of COVID-19 there increased after, so the transferring had to be stopped to prevent further problems.</br></br>

During the commotion, tents and bathroom and showers were being put up outside, in the big yard, where we do our workout and exercises. I was definitely worried when I saw the nine tents in the yard. It made me wondered if I happened to move and had to live in a tent, out of being in a single-man cell that I'm so used to live in. I'm worried I wouldn't get to move back to house in a cell again. Not that the thought of me catching the virus somehow have haunted me a little bit. I wouldn't want to die in prison, like 20 something prisoners who have been misfortune by the outbreak.</br></br>

The pandemic isn't over yet. My building is still on quarantine as of right now, for the third time, and this time it's longer the last two because one person tested positive and another also tested positive right before the two weeks of quarantine ends. I hope this is the last.</br></br>
 
I missed working and being outside of this building for several hours doing something. I'm lucky to stay disciplined of working out, exercising, and how convenient it is that my building has a mini yard for me to run (I love running), 30 to 54 laps - about three to five miles, every morning at 9. Running keeps my body, mind, and spirit healthy, COVID proof.</br></br>

Quite a few options I have in my cell. I can read - Take Me With You, by Catherine Ryan Hyde - a very good book, I can watch TV, or I can study my courses for business - my plan is to own a small business of an animal shelter in the future. You wouldn't believe if I tell you that there are cats living in front of my building, yes, they are very loving adorable creatures God created, and I'm weak when I see them, or even think of them, so I feed them with canned goods - tunas and chickens, I bought at the store. Listening to music, radio, having coffee with donuts early morning after I rised from a good night sleep, keeps my inner strengths well managed.</br></br>

As religion is a part of my life, having such wonderful and interesting people who have been incarcerated for more than a decade is a blessing; especially during the pandemic and the holidays season. Christian brothers would be among the group of people I mostly associate here in the building. I feel trusted and together and we make each other stronger in difficult times. These brothers, including myself, had put ourselves here, but over the years of doing time, we just realized that the life we once lived - robbery, stealing, dealing, even killing - isn't helping us out at all. So we did what's right for us and for our family back home who have been loyal and waiting for us to come back home. We turned to God.</br></br>

Mom is the most important person of my life. Whenever I got a chance, I give her a call to make sure she's ok at home. Talking to her on the phone and knowing that she's safe and alive makes me feel strong and comforted. She and my three sisters are relieved about my life living in a good environment, and they know I handled things well.</br></br>

I wish you the best in school and in pursuing your dreams. I hope my little true story inspired you. May you and your loved ones enjoy the holiday season together. Merry Christmas and have a happy new year. Please stay safe. Take care. God bless you!</br></br>

Sincerely.
