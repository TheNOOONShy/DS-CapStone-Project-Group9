This story was told by a person incarcerated at Fire Camps.</br></br>

Caller: So, do I just start going or?</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, you're good to go. Tell me wherever you want to start.</br></br>

Caller: I want to start with the issues that I have personally had with the Jamestown facility, Sierra Conservation Camp in Jamestown, California. There's currently an outbreak there of COVID-19. And what they are doing is they are quarantining inmates that have tested positive for COVID inside of a gym where CDCR staff works.</br></br>

The Sierra Conservation Center in Jamestown consists of level one and two inmates on the A and B yard. And then they have a C block for level three and four inmates, which is cell living.</br></br>

On the A yard when the COVID outbreak started, which was caused by a corrections officer after some inmates came in and started a riot, he chased them up the stairs, made contact with him physically, made physical contact with inmates that were part of the firefighting training program, and he tested positive for COVID two days later, so those inmates were immediately quarantined.</br></br>

Now the only reason why I personally found out about the quarantine is because after my quarantine, being a level one inmate being put into a level three facility, or section of the facility for quarantine for 14 days, the day we were set to transpac, one of the staff members from Sierra Conservation Center put an inmate that came into contact with the corrections officer, a positive COVID test, was into the Transpac vehicle with us.</br></br>

So, we drove all the way down to Southern California. We drove all the way down to Los Angeles, six and a half hours away, and when we got to the Holton facility, the transport officer received a phone call from the Director of Health from Sierra Conservation Center, saying that we need to immediately distance ourselves from any and everybody and get back in the vehicle and come back to the Jamestown Sierra Conservation Center facility.</br></br>

I was deeply concerned about that decision for a couple of reasons. One, we had made two stops on the way to Los Angeles. One at the Shell Station.</br></br>

Two, we stopped at the truckers stop where we were allowed to get out and use the bathroom and the water fountain, where there were women, children, and teenagers all over the place going into the bathroom right after us and in the line for consumption of water at the water fountain.</br></br>

I made these issues known because we stopped on the way to Holton and on the way back to Jamestown, and utilized these same two facilities both times on the way to and from. And I told the - my counselor, and I wrote a 22 form to the warden.</br></br>

And I 602'd a formal complaint to the facility that I believe that we needed to immediately contact the local health officials so that they could initiate the track and trace program to let these people know that hey, there is a strong possibility that they had been in direct contact with someone who's been in direct contact with COVID-19 per the protocol.</br></br>

UCI: Right.</br></br>

Caller: They refused to respond to my request. And I made multiple complaints about this, and they did nothing about it. So, when we finally got back to Jamestown, you would think that they would put in a proper protocol to isolate us from all the other inmates. No, that's not what they did.</br></br>

They put us back into the quarantine cells, but they continued to allow us out of our cells to pick up our food trays. They continued to allow us to mingle with level three inmates while they were being released, and we were taking showers and going to breakfast.</br></br>

We were taking showers, so we were having direct contact. They never wiped down any of the showers after we used them until I made four or five complaints.</br></br>

UCI: That's amazing. You can't make that up.</br></br>

Caller: No, it's amazingly incompetent. No, this is all true. I have - I have records for this.</br></br>

UCI: That's amazing.</br></br>

Caller: I have this all on file. They did not give us disposable food trays as they were supposed to, and I was letting them know this on a daily basis.</br></br>

UCI: Oh my god.</br></br>

Caller: They ended up leaving us in quarantine for 36 days. And we don't know why. Normally the quarantine was 14 days, and you'd leave on the 15th day.</br></br>

They allowed people that we had direct contact with, that were also on quarantine, but we were having direct contact with them, but when their doors would pop, we would all go down and get our food together, and we would mingle, stop, and hang out.</br></br>

We were all touching the same handrails. The handrails weren't getting wiped down. Again, we shared the same shower with the other groups that were transpacing to other facilities for fire camp.</br></br>

So we came back on Thursday, I believe it was June - July the 22nd, and they were still allowed to leave the facility on July the 23rd. And we're talking about 22 people.</br></br>

UCI: Wow.</br></br>

Caller: What had me completely blown away is the fact that they refused to give us any hand sanitizer. They refused to give us any vitamins. They refused to give - allow us to go outside. They refused to allow us to get on the telephone.</br></br>

And my complaint was, look, if you can allow us to go and pick up our food trays, why - and you can allow us to take showers every other day, why can't we go over and use the phone? And simply wipe the phone down so we can reach out to our loved ones and let them know where we are.</br></br>

My mother was calling the facility Jamestown Sierra Conservation Center every day for three weeks, because she thought I had died because I didn't call her for her birthday. And they refused to let her know what my status was because she was not on an authorized person on my list.</br></br>

When they did finally reach out to me, I had already been moved from that facility to this new facility, which is pretty cool, in Soledad. So, it took them over three weeks to notify me that my mother was frantically looking for me.</br></br>

Ultimately, CDCR at Jamestown is responsible for the outbreak that is currently taking place today. When I left there on August the 5th, I believe, there was over 100 active COVID cases. The day that the pandemic started to unravel was June the 21st. And I believe they had seven positive tests that day.</br></br>

Within a three-week time period, they had over 100 active cases, and the facility was in stage two of the pandemic. And they are performing poorly, extremely poorly in initiating any type of competent contamination containment protocol. And I was talking to this with the CO's - oh, that's terrible.</br></br>

UCI: Oh my gosh.</br></br>

Caller: I don't claim to be an expert in COVID, but I have -</br></br>

UCI: No, don't -</br></br>

Caller: Participated in several Board of Supervisors meetings. I'm very familiar with the CDC website.</br></br>

UCI: Why don't you call right back? Yeah, call right back if you can? And yeah, please. </br></br>

Caller: I'll call right - I'll try to get to you if it's possible. I don't know how to continue the call, but I'm gonna call right now, right when I hang up the phone, I'm gonna call right back. I'll give you a call back right now. Thanks.</br></br>

UCI: Okay, yup.
