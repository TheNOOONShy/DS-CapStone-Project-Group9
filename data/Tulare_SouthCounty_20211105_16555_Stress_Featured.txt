This story was told by a person incarcerated at Tulare South County Detention Center.</br></br>

Caller: When I'm out there, you know what I mean, if they call me to come and do your roof, they expect me to do my job, and that's what I do. I do my job. So, it's just like everybody has their own job to do, you know? Like right now the deputies that are working, if we need something pertinent, we can ask them to go do it, and they'll get it for us.</br></br> 

Then there's this couple around here that are just straight inmate haters, you know? You don't like your job, go work somewhere else. Go work and do my job. I'll take your job right now.</br></br>But, I mean, and then the medical here, sometimes the medical is horrible here, I think. Sometimes, you know what I mean, I've been trying to get a couple things looked at like nodule on my neck. Still waiting a month later. My shoulder Ñ I don't know what I did to my shoulder, but I hurt my shoulder, and now it still hurts, and it is something deeper.</br></br>You know what I mean? I need them to do an X-ray. Tell me what is going on. It is like getting some things done here, and I think it's a lack of money for the state, or whatever it is, but still, they have a job to do. They need to do it.
