This story was told by a person incarcerated at Donovan.</br></br>

UCI: So, I’m going to ask you a few questions. What facility are you currently housed at?</br></br>

Caller: Uh, RJD Donovan.</br></br>

UCI: Okay, and what is the current COVID-19 situation at your facility?</br></br>

Caller: Uh, I don’t believe we have any active case right now in our facility, but we are under uh, strict, uh modified program.</br></br>

UCI: Okay.</br></br>

Caller: We do not have no yards which, no recreational kinds, uh we do have limited access to uh, uh day room activity uh and we do have... we do not have any education or classes going, we do not have access to law library. </br></br>

We do have very limited medical I have to say, because a lot of minor problems, if you have been complaining about minor problems they will usually tell you to wait uh, so that’s about it. Maybe I’m forgetting a lot of stuff if you have any questions.</br></br>

UCI: What is troubling or concerning to you?</br></br>

Caller: Well, of course the family situation. We’re not getting no visits so, also we’re having limited phone conversations. I haven’t seen my family, my elderly mom who is 83 years old, I haven’t seen her for… I think about, what, since last November? It’s been a year?</br></br

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: Wow! I didn’t even realize that.</br></br>

UCI: I’m very sorry to hear that.</br></br>

Caller: Thank you. Uh, yeah that’s my biggest concern, about family. And next is my own safety, of course. I do understand that if anybody, uh, contract COVID, it have to come in from outside.</br></br>

I see a lot of different staff has different attitude towards mask protocols and six feet distancing. Some do, some just don’t. They don’t like to wear glo- wear, wear, um wear masks, just same as inmates here. So that’s my concern.</br></br>

The setting in our facility is six men confined cell. They call it “pod”. That concerns me because six men has different activities all day. I’m not sure who they uh interacting with… staff, nurse, so that’s my problem. Oh and other thing is that I see so often when people complaining about um coughing or, or, or fever may come across by common cold. They been sending out to different facility which, it’s very inconvenient.</br></br>

Lot of, lot of inmates in here are doing life sentence. Meaning where they at right now is, is where they live. This is everything they have. And when you’re being moved just because you have little cough, that’s another concern. Other than that I think I’m coping OK, consider the circumstances, yes.</br></br>

UCI: Okay. And how was COVID-19 handled at your facility at the beginning of the outbreak?</br></br>

Caller: Oh at the beginning, we, oh I remember we were under uh, we were under modified program, just like now. We didn’t have no yard or anything but we weren’t issued no masks for I want to say at least two to three months in that we finally got some masks.</br></br>

We were, we were, we were really confused because they were enforcing the six feet distancing, social distancing, however we were in the same dining hall with, packed in, 150 guys in there from different buildings. So we’re getting different messages. Maybe the department was confused about it also, but we were definitely confused.</br></br>

UCI: And is it being handled differently now?</br></br>

Caller: It’s, it, it has been, yes, I consider this is a lot better than the beginning. Cause we are not walking to dining hall, which, you know that eliminates the interaction with guys from different buildings so that’s kinda, that’s a good thing. Uh also, other than that, well other than that I think it’s the same. Except, uh yeah.</br></br>

UCI: And how have you been coping with the crisis?</br></br> 

Caller: Well staying, well staying positive, I guess. Myself, I’m a Christian so I pray a lot of course. I pray, exercise, uh exercise will be probably the biggest thing. Oh and the other thing is that the college classes that I-</br></br

The class, the classes, the class assignments are pretty good, they’re keeping me busy.</br></br> 

UCI: Yeah, that’s good.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah that was good thing. Um, and I, everybody have to, kind of, do your own thing you got to know how to cope with it I believe. And I myself, I’m serving life without, I’ve been incarcerated over 20 years, I’ve been in worse situation. I’ve been under lockdown, two man cell, for nine months uh so, I think I’m coping okay. Yeah, I build a tolerance.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah definitely. Um, what else do you want people to know about your experience?</br></br>

Caller: Um, I want people to understand that, we are very, we are in a very vulnerable situation and I- I know people out there are suffering from many social interaction restriction and other normal things that you cannot do. I want people to take encouragement from what we going through here.</br></br>

Such as lockdown situation right now we facing in California. This is something we go through everyday myself been through past 20 some years. And uh, there’s always light at the end of the tunnel. And uh, always have to just stay positive and think positive.</br></br>
 
Things change and we are, we are, we are resilient, I mean we adapt to new environment situations so if I have any, if this recording to reach to people out there, I want to encourage people out there I don’t have much complaining, what it is right now. Yeah, we just got to learn to accept the new things and adapt to the new norms.</br></br>

UCI: Okay well thank you so much for participating in PrisonPandemic. We are out here thinking about you. We hope the situation gets better. And I’m not sure if you know we have a P.O. box?</br></br>

Caller: Oh, okay. I think I’m not sure, asked me to mention him, uh, anyway he has, he has, give me the P.O. box address so I do have it.</br></br>

UCI: OK yeah feel free to um, you can send us anything and I’m not sure if we’re going to be sending out a newsletter um but that might be a thing, but feel free to use the P.O. box and send us anything.</br></br>

Caller: Okay, I will do that.</br></br>

UCI: Okay, thank you so much. We’re thinking about you and we hope it gets better.</br></br>

Caller: Thank you. Oh, one more thing.</br></br>

UCI: Sure.</br></br>

Caller: My friend asked me to mention this. As I mentioned earlier, I’m serving life without possibility of parole. Uh, and I been programming and I was up for governor’s commutation of 2018. And uh, my, my application was before to uh, California Supreme Court by uh, Jerry Brown and it was, it was denied by court because… I, I’m not really sure, but people was saying it’s, it’s a political move. However, I, my supporters just created an online petition and uh I wanted to ask you guys if you guys could support my online petition and it’s under change.org. Uh, free, free-</br></br>
