This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Susanville.</br></br>

I do have a story that I would like to share that might not seem too serious to some, but really upset me when it happened; on more than one occasion, no less. Well, the story starts like this, we had to isolate due to the fact that a couple people in my dorm tested positive for COVID-19 in late February.</br></br>

Each dorm holds about 32 people, but 24 is the maximum they are putting in each dorm due to COVID-19. They are leaving eight dorms empty at all times. So when someone tests positive, protocol is for non-positive people to isolate on another yard (the Lassen Yard) for two weeks in two-man cells.</br></br>

The people who tested positive stay in the dorm, or move to another dorm on the yard from which we left. They isolate as well, until they are symptom-free, and test negative.</br></br>

Anybody who tests positive on the Lassen Yard during the time we are there will be moved back to our original yard (the Cascade) and isolate, and have to start their two weeks over again, and get tested daily, and come off isolation when they are symptom-free, and test negative. And if they have a cellmate who tested negative, he has to start his isolation all over again in the cell alone.</br></br>

Well, when we are at Lassen Yard, isolating, the nurses come in twice a day to take our temps, and to ask us if we have any other symptoms, and to periodically COVID test us via nasal swab. During these visits, prisoners will ask them if they should get the COVID shot, or ask them information about the shot.</br></br>

For FYI I have had the shot, both shots (Moderna). I believe in the vaccine, and as a 50 year-old man, wanted all the protection I could get. So when they offered the vaccine, I did not hesitate. Very grateful to be able to obtain the vaccine knowing that some countries are not able receive them for some time, or it’s gonna be difficult for them to obtain the vaccine.</br></br>

Listen to a lot of NPR Radio (LOL). We are a very spoiled country!</br></br>

Well, back to my story, when the nurse was asked this question, she gave the most uneducated answer, along with the correctional officer. They would say that COVID was not real, and the vaccine was a fraud, and that they did not get the vaccine.</br></br>

You could definitely tell that they were stating their political views rather than an educated answer pertaining to a sincerely-asked question. Or even no answer would have been better, telling the inmate that that’s a personal choice he has to make, and that I would not want my answer to influence him either way. Or my decision to get the vaccine influence his decision either.</br></br>

But to say the vaccine and pandemic is fake, or that it’s over-exaggerated by the media, or by the government (Democrats), left-wing conspiracy? Really? (LOL) Really upset me, because I know this COVID-19 virus is not serious for some people, but could be very serious for others, especially people with pre-existing conditions, like asthma.</br></br>

I have a friend who is my age, but still plays baseball (hardball) in a league. I mean he is very healthy who got COVID-19, and was in a medically-induced coma for two weeks due to respiratory difficulties. He is fine now, thank God. But if he would of got the vaccine, maybe he could of been able to fight the virus more effectively, or maybe not caught it at all.</br></br>

So for some of these nurses, and even correctional officers to answer these questions about the vaccine in this manner, is both professionally and ethically wrong. Very irresponsible behavior by a medical professional. What do you think?</br></br>

This happened on more than one occasion, on Cascade Yard and at Lassen Yard when we were quarantined in late February, and early March. I have been COVID-free, and I would like to think it’s because I decided to get vaccinated.
