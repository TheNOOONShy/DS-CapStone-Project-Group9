This story was told by a person incarcerated at Mule Creek. </br></br>


Caller: When I first went into isolation, I mean it was unreal for me. The first cell that I was put into was next to somebody that was actually positive and they were just, I remember waking- I got taken out at about one o’clock in the morning and I was put next to this gentleman and I arrived there probably about 2:30 in the morning. </br></br>


And I laid there until about four o’clock in the morning in the darkness and I just remember just laying there thinking to myself, “How did this happen to me?” You know, “How did I come up positive?” And at the time I didn’t know if I was positive or negative, I’m only going by what staff told me because they had removed me from my housing. </br></br>


And, so that morning about six o’clock, when they start doing breakfast and the staff start coming around and you know people just generally start waking up. I hear the gentleman next to me in the cell through the vent just start coughing and hacking and I mean, it was horrible.
