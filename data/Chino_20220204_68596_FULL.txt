This story was told by a person incarcerated at Chino.</br></br>

UCI: What has the COVID situation been like at your facility?</br></br>

Caller: It’s been like a living hell.</br></br>

UCI: Gotcha. Okay, can you tell me a little bit more?</br></br>

Caller: They have us quarantined up. They quarantined us a lot and they always want to move us around, man. Like, during, during a quarantine, after they quarantined us, why would they move us around to more people that are already sick?</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>

Caller: So I don’t understand why they move us to another dorm where other people are already sick there.</br></br>

UCI: Gotcha. So would you say they’re, they’re not handling it too well, huh?</br></br>

Caller: No, they’re not.</br></br>

UCI: Gotcha. And what about the vaccination situation. What has that been like at your facility?</br></br>

Caller: I’m, I’m vaccinated, I’m vaccinated.</br></br>

UCI: Oh, nice. What about everyone else? Are they also vaccinated, too?</br></br>

Caller: Nah. Some people are, some people ain’t.</br></br>

UCI: Oh, okay. Gotcha. And, are they giving you guys, like, good information about the vaccine? Like, what’s in it and what are the side effects and stuff?</br></br>

Caller: No, they didn’t give - nah, nah.</br></br>

UCI: Nothing like that?</br></br>

Caller: Nah.</br></br>

UCI: Gotcha. Okay, and how has the COVID situation at your facility affected your loved ones?</br></br>

Caller: It affected them a lot ‘cause they, they ended up taking some of my time away that they wasn’t supposed to have taken away from me.</br></br>

UCI: Gotcha. And so-</br></br>

Caller: They write us for bullshit-</br></br> 

UCI: Oh. Mm-hmm.</br></br>

Caller: They write us up for bullshit write ups and taking our time without us going to committee, without it being heard in front of the committee.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm. Yeah. gotcha. And, so, have they reduced visitation at your facility?</br></br>

Caller: Right now we’re all in quarantine, so we can’t get no visits.</br></br>

UCI: Okay, damn. And so, they, they haven’t let you guys have any visits or anything like that for how long?</br></br>

Caller: For, like, months already.</br></br>

UCI: Really? Wow! So I’m guessing you haven’t been able to see your loved ones for quite a while then, right?</br></br>

Caller: Yes.</br></br>

UCI: Gotcha. And what has it been like for you to have reduced visitation and programming?</br></br>

Caller: It’s just hard. Real hard, man.</br></br>

UCI: Gotcha. And how have you been coping, like, with the crisis? Like what have you been doing to kind of keep your mind busy?</br></br>

Caller: Watching a little bit of TV. Watching a little bit of TV and reading books.</br></br>

UCI: Gotcha. Okay, cool, cool. And what would you — what would have made the situation at your facility better? Like, what would you do to make it better?</br></br>

Caller: What would make it better is that they have - they would explain to us what’s really going on, and explain to us what’s — explain to us what’s really going on and kind of better the situation if they handled it differently than what they handled it, handled it like.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm. Gotcha. Okay, and did — were you infected with COVID-19?</br></br>

Caller: You said "Were you infected?"</br></br>

UCI: Yeah. Were, were you infected with COVID-19 at any time?</br></br>

Caller: No. No, I got the shot.</br></br>

UCI: Oh, okay. Nice, nice.</br></br>

Caller: I got the vaccine.</br></br>

UCI: Nice. Okay, cool. And, if anything — if you could do anything, what would you — what would you do to make the situation at your facility better?</br></br>

Caller: Shit. Try to be able to go home earlier?</br></br>

UCI: Haha. I feel that, man. Gotcha.</br></br>

Caller: Haha.</br></br>

UCI: And what about, like, the, the correctional officers? Have they been, like, giving you guys masks and cleaning the, the common areas and stuff?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, yeah. They’ve been giving — they’ve been giving us masks but not like, not like, frequently like they should. And they gave it to us they, like, every blue moon.</br></br>

UCI: They — okay. And can you tell me a little bit more about that? You said that they don’t give it to you every, like, every day?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah. You — give me one second.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, go ahead. Sorry.</br></br>

UCI: Oh yeah. So, you said that they don’t give it to you guys every day. Can you tell me a little bit more about that?</br></br>

Caller: They probably give it to us maybe, maybe once - maybe once a month they probably change our masks?</br></br>

UCI: Wow, okay. So you guys don’t get like, nice, clean, fresh masks every day?</br></br>

Caller: Yes.</br></br>

UCI: Gotcha.</br></br>

Caller: We don’t get them every day.</br></br>

UCI: Man. Okay. And what about, like, cleaning supplies. Do they gave — do they give you guys, like, gloves or, like any, anything to, like, clean off your, your cell.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, so, sometimes. Sometimes.</br></br>

UCI: Okay. And, do you — if, if you have a cellmate, how have they been handling the situation too? Have they — have they been coping with it? Or what has that been like for any of — any of your friends inside the facility?</br></br>

Caller: Have any of my friends caught COVID?</br></br>

UCI: Yeah. Like, and if they did, you know, have they been cool about it? Like, how—</br></br>

Caller: Yeah.</br></br>

UCI: How have they been handling the situation?</br></br>

Caller: They got sick. Some people got sick real bad.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm. And, when, if they — when they got sick, were they transferred over to another facility or, like, a building?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah. One dude, he—</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>

Caller: One dude had a seizure and one dude had a seizure and went into a coma.</br></br>

UCI: Oh, wow. You said he had a seizure and one had a coma?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, went into a coma.</br></br>

UCI: Oh, okay. Wow. And did the correctional officers do anything to, like, kind of better the situation?</br></br>

Caller: They was sitting there — they was sitting there pressing his chest for about, like, 30, 45 minutes.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm. Wow.</br></br>

Caller: Trying to get him to breathe, to breathe again.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>

Caller: He started breathing at the last minute.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah. And, what about, like, the situation, I’m guessing you guys have a hospital in the, in the prison system. So, like—</br></br>

Caller: Yes.</br></br>

UCI: Have they been helpful too? Or, you know, have they been kind of like, leaving you guys aside?</br></br>

Caller: It’s basically they, they always, all they do is move - only thing they do when you get sick, they move you to a cell to isolate by yourself. That's how they do it.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, okay.</br></br>

Caller: They ain’t even take you to a hospital to isolate you. They take you to another cell to cell living. Individual cell living, and it’s staying in the cell by yourself.</br></br>

UCI: Gotcha. Okay. And, one last question, man. So, do you think the correctional officers or the staff at the prison system, have they been handling — have they been handling the situation of COVID, like, good, or do you think they could do better?</br></br>

Caller: I think they could do better.</br></br>

UCI: Gotcha.</br></br>

Caller: A lot better.</br></br>

UCI: Okay. Nice. Sounds good. Well, is there anything, any last - any last thoughts that you want to share with me, then?</br></br>

Caller: That they, they - about them taking our time away from us that's bull shit without going through a committee.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah. And the — you said you guys were in quarantine. To go back on that, on that thought: did they — how has the situation affected you?</br></br>

Caller: The COVID-</br></br>

UCI: Uh-huh?</br></br>

Caller: Go ahead. What’d you say?</br></br>

UCI: How has the COVID situation, like, affected your, your family or anyone that’s tried to, like, visit you?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah it’s, it’s affected my family a lot ‘cause I can’t go home when I’m supposed to, and they, they work around my time.</br></br>

UCI: Gotcha. And I’m guessing they, they reduced visitation, right?</br></br>

Caller: Yes.</br></br>

UCI: Gotcha. And what could have made the situation better for you and your loved ones?</br></br>

Caller: They could rightfully change our masks in time, give us better opportunity to get out earlier.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm. Gotcha. Okay.</br></br>

Caller: Stuff like that.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah yeah yeah, fasho. It’s all good. And, yeah so pretty much that’s all the questions I have but is there like I, like I said before, is there any, you know, last thoughts or? </br></br>

Caller: You want to know what, you want to know what cell I’m in — what my dorm I’m in and whatnot?</br></br>

UCI: Say that one more time?</br></br>

Caller: Do you — do you wanna know what dorm room I’m in? I’ll tell you my number and all that!</br></br>

UCI: The dorm you stay at?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah.</br></br>

UCI: No, it’s okay ‘cause you, you don’t have to tell us anything that identifies you. That way you know, if, if they do listen to this conversation they don’t, they don’t know who you are and they don’t — they can’t use anything against you.</br></br>

Caller: All right.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>

Caller: All right. I, I wouldn’t give a fuck anyway!</br></br>

UCI: Haha! It’s all good, man. You know, I’m just trying protect you and them, you know, so, definitely don’t want to—</br></br>

Caller: All right.</br></br>

UCI: Say anything that, like, identifies you. But yeah yeah yeah! Like I said, any, any last thoughts before I, before I let you go?</br></br>

Caller: Nah. I just wanna tell you: take care and God bless you and your family, man.</br></br>

UCI: Aye, fasho. God bless you, man.</br></br>

Caller: All right. Well, you have a good day and God bless you.</br></br>

UCI: All right. You too, brother. All right.</br></br>

Caller: All right. Bye.</br></br>

UCI: Yup.
