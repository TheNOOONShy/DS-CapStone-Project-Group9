This story was told by a family member of someone incarcerated at Tulare Bob Wiley Detention Center.</br></br>Caller: Yes. And so, I don't know, if they stopped doing that, or what the people started to get sick in my sister's facility. And she felt like they weren't quarantining them properly. And they were sort of using the fact that people got sick as a way to lessen their programs.</br></br> 

So instead of being an hour, I guess they were 30 minutes. And so that was a big issue for my sister. You know, and then, I guess, like that not all the deputies wear masks.</br></br>Are you still there?</br></br>UCI: Oh, yes, I can still hear you.</br></br>Caller: Okay, and then, so, when my sister wanted to get vaccinated before, they put her on a waiting list, instead of just getting her, her vaccine when they got her call slip, and said that at least 10 people had to sign up for the vaccination, before they would vaccinate her. I don't know if that's normal protocol.</br></br> 

I just feel like if you're trying to, you know, prevent the spread and a jail or anything like that you would want to, you know, get to that as soon as possible. So, it took like, a month, I think, for them to even, you know, vaccinate her the first time. And, yeah.</br></br>
