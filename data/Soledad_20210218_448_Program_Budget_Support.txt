Theme: Program: Budget and Support


Program</br></br>


I mentioned at the beginning of my tall about life inside during the COVID crisis, that there was some positive programming that I am involved in; some of which I actually created. We [inmates] are trying to start a first of its kind Program on my facility, [C.T.F North B Facility]. And I was in the U.S. army so I'm a vet. And I am the coordinator.</br></br>


Both of these projects had just got in the air and we were shut down by COVID. Even worse than COVID though, there existed and still exists that same negative, anti-inmate/anti-positive programming attitude at this prison. There COVID issue just made it easier to slow down our progress while having something to hide behind. I have included a "mission statement" for the Program and a couple of contacts.</br></br>
In all of this, there is one staff member and he is worth his weight in gold. He supports us 1000%. A lot of staff despises him and call him a "hug-a-thug" cop because he advocates for us. To put it in plain English, we need outside support to be involved and/or support what we're doing, so the whole anti-positive programming crowd here has no room to operate.</br></br>
They do not want to be exposed as having that attitude. They exist quietly and are subversive. If someone like UC Irvine, or someone within its network is involved bringing positive attention to what we are doing, the aforementioned group will just have to scurry away. Think abusive parents when they think someone is watching.</br></br>


So, my request is for you to help me network and to assist me in getting our fledgling program off the ground. I have been locked up for 23 years. I taught myself to play guitar in prison and play a pretty mean Stevie Ray Vaughn. I write songs and have been recorded in prison.</br></br>


When I arrived here at CTF in 201 8, they had no program. They had some damaged, old junky equipment in what was the shower room for the prison gym.</br></br>


I commandeered the 15 x 40-foot room to begin its transition into the Program. My father donated $700 worth of paint and supplies and no sooner had I painted the room red, white, and blue, all program was shut down because of the Coronavirus. Staff have told us they think the programs are "stupid". What do you say to that? Given the known benefits of the rehabilitative value of music and the arts. We intend to merger the benefits of learning to play an instrument and or coexisting in a band with the rehabilitative needs of the incarcerated inmates suffering from PTSD.</br></br>


TIIE STATE WILL PAY FOR NOTHING. BUDGET CONSTRAINTS</br></br>


I am free and clear to acquire all the donations I want. I'll make this part very brief and if anyone is interested in helping, they can write me for more specifics. In short, including sound proofing for a 15x40x12 foot gym shower room with foam rubber acoustic treatment tiles, I need to completely outfit this room for music learning and playing, plus the Sound Reinforcement for playing live outdoor venues to a crowd of 200 - 300 inmates and staff, i.e. mixing console, speakers, mics, etc. We need everything literally. Music cords, stands, all instruments, racks, cases, amplifiers, electric guitars, bass guitars speakers, etc. imagine Taylor Swift building her studio here, then leaving.</br></br>


We need all the help we can get. The form letter you sent premised the whole thing on the hopes of causing prison reform. We are here trying to do the same thing. I am hoping with some networking, we can find people/companies willing to donate the equipment we need so we can get this music program going and have the support/exposure we need so that the anti-inmate crowd here will either have to support us or just keep quiet.</br></br>


The main writing here, pages 1 thru 5 are in response to the COVID Behind Bars/Prison Pandemic questionnaire you sent, that you said you would post anonymously on UC Irvine's website. The separate, but included letter/info about the programs as a whole, that we're trying to build here, is for your consumption and maybe you can advise me on how to continue</br></br>
