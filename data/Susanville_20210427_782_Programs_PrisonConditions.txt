I must tell you that although vocation programs and rehabilitation programs were shut down because there was no movement, I was able to enroll in college correspondence. That alone I can be grateful for, I was one of the few people fortunate enough to accomplish anything through the pandemic. For the fall semester of 2020, I earned 84 days off my sentence and my standing is dean's honors.</br></br>

I almost have spring semester of 2021 behind me. I'll be earning 84 more days off my sentence and will retain dean's honors. I now look onto summer semester 2021. So I've been able to fight through the struggle.</br></br>

However, vocation did try to deny me the auto mechanic certificate I earned due to the pandemic. I filed an appeal, and I want it. Now it's in my file. I wanted it there because I have a proposition 57 date for non-violent release. My accomplishments look good for that.</br></br>

During the course of COVID-19, my fire camp program has been cut off. The reason really being because of my nasal polyps as I write this story. I have a medical hold and am forbidden to go to camp until surgery. Today I saw the doctor and he told me to be patient, things are about to open up medically from COVID-19 restrictions.</br></br>

My surgery will be soon. I hope so. I have just over three and a half years left on my sentence. Fire camp will cut that time in half.
