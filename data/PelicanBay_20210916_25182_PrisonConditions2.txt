This story was told by a person incarcerated at Pelican Bay.</br></br> 

UCI: Are they quarantining anyone who does test positive?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah. Yeah, they'll take them to a different building. That's what happened to me the first time, when the pandemic first started. I was working out and the medical staff came around taking temperatures.</br></br>

And I was just finished working out and my temperature was high. So, they took me to a different building because they said that I tested positive. But I told them I was just finished working out, but they didn't listen, though. They quarantined me for two weeks.</br></br>

UCI: And what was that like when you were in quarantine?</br></br>

Caller: Oh, I'm not going to lie, it's kind of rough. Can't get no store. Can't get nothing. Just inside the cell for 24 hours.</br></br>

They would shower us like every other day. So, I was just showering inside the cell like almost every day.</br></br>

UCI: And how many people would you say were in the quarantine area?</br></br>

Caller: Maybe about 20 to 15. Yeah, about 20 to 15 individuals.
