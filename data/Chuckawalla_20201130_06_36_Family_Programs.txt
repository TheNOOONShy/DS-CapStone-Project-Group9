This story was told by a person incarcerated at Chuckawalla.</br></br>

And how has the COVID-19 situation affected your loved ones?</br></br>
Caller: Well, first they tried to call to find out what was going on 'cause I called them and told them that I wasn’t feeling good. But the - I guess after the next day I went to the hospital, they were trying to call, trying to find out the prison. They wouldn’t give them any information.</br></br>
 
UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>

Caller: They kept calling and calling. They kept, "Hello we’re going to transfer you," and then nobody answering the phone and pretty much, yeah.</br></br>
They were worried for like 10 days I didn’t get in contact with them.</br></br>
UCI: Wow, that’s horrible.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah.</br></br> 

UCI: And so what has - oh, continue.</br></br>
Caller: I'm sorry go ahead. No, no go ahead that’s it.</br></br>
UCI: I was just going to ask you another question you can continue if you want with that question.</br></br>
Caller: No, no, no. That was it.</br></br>
UCI: Okay. So, what has it been like for you to have visitation - to have reduced visitation and programming?</br></br>
Caller: I'm sorry.</br></br>
UCI: What has it been like for you to have reduced visitation and programming?</br></br>
Caller: Well, it feels, you know, pretty much taking our rights - not rights but at least something taken away.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br> 

Caller: I mean, this is helping us get out faster, you know. This is help programs that are helping us get a, you know, to be better off.</br></br>

UCI: Right.</br></br> 

Caller: And we’re trying but they’re saying we can't go nowhere, we can't go to class, we can't do nothing.</br></br> 

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>

Caller: The only thing we have right now is our college classes to help us.
