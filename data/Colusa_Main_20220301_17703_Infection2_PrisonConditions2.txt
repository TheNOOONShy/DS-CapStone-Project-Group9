This story was told by a person incarcerated at Colusa County Jail.</br></br>

UCI: And you had said you wear masks, do they provide those for you?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, yeah, every time we come out of our cell.</br></br>

UCI: Oh, you get new ones?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah.</br></br>

UCI: Okay.</br></br>

Caller: That’s why I think that’s the only thing that’s good about that. That's the only thing they do good around here is just give us the masks.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>

Caller: Clean masks.</br></br>

UCI: And then. Oh, so sorry.</br></br>

Caller: Sorry, no go ahead. I said when which was kinda crappy because it's the only time they give us something clean.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah no that’s - what would happen if somebody were to test positive for COVID?</br></br>

Caller: They probably would get moved out. Well, last time I was here, they — when someone tested positive, they just got rolled up and rolled out to the next room. And they didn't even clean or sanitize where they were at, which was in here with us.</br></br>

UCI: And do they come back after quarantining or?</br></br>

Caller: Well, actually I don't even know about that. They probably would’ve, but the girl I think she got released and went home after her court date. But I don’t think it's because of COVID she has to go home.</br></br>

UCI: Oh, okay.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah.</br></br>

UCI: Oh, Sorry.</br></br>

Caller: She was in her own room for a minute.</br></br>

UCI: Okay.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, seven days or so.
