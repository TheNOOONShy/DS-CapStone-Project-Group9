This story was told by a person incarcerated at Chuckawalla.</br></br>
Caller: Alrighty. Well, of course, you know, what's been going on here at, you know, CVSP, at Chuckawalla Valley State Prison. It's just been hectic. You know, here we're here where inmates come from different prisons here.</br></br>In fact last night, there was an inmate that was very sick that just came back, just came off of the bus. According to officers, he was quarantined for 14 days. Well, somehow or another he's been sick for the past few days and now the whole cube, which is cube 17, they're in quarantine. And according to them, this gentleman has COVID-19.</br></br>Not to mention you have several other inmates that are housed here with us. All of us here in our building is free of COVID-19 at this time and moment. But bringing inmates from another facility and transferring them from one yard to another, all it does is put us susceptible to the situation, the pandemic. Last week we had a big breakout on three block, and I am in four block.</br></br>Well, in three block they quarantined the building being that there was more than one individual that was with the virus. Well, the officer that worked there that morning, she ended up quarantining in our building the next day. So, we're like, well what's going on here?</br></br>You know, they just quarantined that building, so why would she come over here and work with us? Are you trying to spread the pandemic or are you trying to, you know, get us sick again? Well, throughout the day, there was times that she was not only half-masked, she didn't have her mask on. Majority of the inmates are running around with, you know, half mask, if not without the mask, which they should be. It's just been hectic. Not to mention all my loved ones.
