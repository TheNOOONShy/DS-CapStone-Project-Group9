Infection</br></br>Now I’m going to share my experiences with you. On February 2020 around 10:30 am., my cellmate was having a medical emergency.</br></br>I made the COs (correctional officers) aware of the situation. They seen he couldn’t walk so they sounded the alarm. They rushed our cell and I was placed in handcuffs.</br></br>They asked me if he had used any drugs. I answered “No, he hasn’t.” But they ignored my response. So they proceeded like it was an overdose.</br></br>They were administering the narcan to my cellmate and I started yelling “He’s not fucking OD-ing!” They shot him a few times with the adrenaline shot and then they took him. I must make clear the medical staff was the one handling the “allege” overdose.</br></br>I was taken out a couple of hours later and was question, photograph (my whole body) and asked to provide them with a DNA sample.</br></br>At this point I didn’t know what was going on. I was placed in a small phone booth like cage and then served with a lock-up order. A lock up order means you are being placed in administrated segregation or the hole.</br></br>I asked the CO what is the meaning of this and he looked at me with a confused expression. Well your celly died, he told me. “What?” I asked. I was totally floored with the news, frozen. I couldn’t believe it! My cellmate was only 30 years old! And he has only 18 months left to his release after being down 10 years.</br></br>Once the shock passed, I started to cry. Because when you live with a person for six months and are basically all day together one of two things happen: you either love them or hate them. And I had a lot of love for my cellmate.</br></br>We were good friends. [Redacted] was his name.</br></br>Prison Conditions</br></br>So on February 2020 I found myself in ad seg or the hole. I was single cell, not allowed to have a cellmate. The COs investigating this case took all my property: clothes, food, TV, mail, pictures, and all my addresses and phone numbers.</br></br>It felt like they didn’t want me to communicate with anyone. I unfortunately didn’t have any numbers or addresses memorized. As a matter of fact, as I write this missive (4/26/21) more than a year later, I still haven’t received none of my property back.</br></br>By now I knew I was in ad seg under investigation for what happened with my celly. I was mourning my friend and these people are telling me that I’m being investigated for what happened. I was supper stressed out.</br></br>As March progress and April came around, I only heard nothing but bad news. It was like the saying about the snowball on top of the hill. The bad news came in bigger increments from bad to worst.</br></br>I have no TV so all my information was second and third hand. I don’t have my address book, so I can’t write a letter and ask my loved ones how they are doing.</br></br>Family</br></br>Well, by loved ones I mean my girlfriend and her kids. My parents and my younger sister are in Mexico in the state of Michoacán. And I’m almost to the point of paranoia with worry.</br></br>My younger brother ( I’m the oldest, he’s the middle child and my sister is the youngest) is also incarcerated and I have no idea how [redacted] State Prison is doing with the pandemic.</br></br>So there you have it, the scenario: I’m in the hole single cell, with none of my stuff. I’m being investigated for my cellmate’s sudden death. I’m sad for his passing but also scared because the implications of an investigation means only one thing. To see if I’m somehow accountable.</br></br> On top of that I’m worry sick for my family but have no way to contact them. Bad times indeed.</br></br> I was in ad seg for four months and I eventually got a letter from my girlfriend. They also started giving us phone calls every two weeks. That made things a lot better. They also started mandating that we wear masks which was fine with me.</br></br>
