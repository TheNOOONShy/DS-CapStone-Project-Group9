UCI: And so, tell me a little what the COVID situation has been like at your facility.</br></br>

So he put - I put my shirt on and I walked out there with him. I go stand in the red box and he said, “No, just keep going up. Go out to the yard.” And I was like, "Okay."</br></br> 

Now I go out to the yard and say, “Am I in trouble or something?” And he was like, “No, you’re not in trouble or nothing.”</br></br> 

And I was like, “Well, what’s going on?” And he’s like, “Do you have a sister or aunt named [redacted], and a sister named [redacted]?” And I was like, “Yeah, I do.”</br></br>

He’s all like, “Is your dad [redacted]?” And I was like, “Yeah, he is.” And they asked me those questions and then he was like, “Hey, your dad just passed away.” And this just happened like recently.</br></br>
