Dear Prison Pandemic,</br></br>

May God bless you and family. Also may this letter find you and the project in the best of health and good spirits. Happy New Year! 2021!</br></br>

Well as for me, I am a 52 year young Black man, will be 53 in January. Praise God. This pandemic is a very scary situation. There are over 1,500 people who are infected with COVID-19 and still counting.</br></br> 

We are housed in a nine by four foot cell with two people to a cell. Bunks are stacked together with one toilet and a sink. No tables, no where to sit, no ladders to climb on the top bunk. We are on shelter in place, so we are lock down 24 hours a day.</br></br> 

Every three days out for a five minute shower, no phone.</br></br>

We eat in our cell all three meals, we are really living like animals. There is no social distance. Especially in your cell, you have to take off your mask to eat, no privacy when you use the bathroom. It is very humiliating and very depressing.</br></br> 

Everyone has mental health problems. It is a outbreak here, now they are building tents outside in the used to be yard and putting people out there in the winter time.</br></br>

So it is 6:30 am is when my day starts off. I get woke up by the nurse to take my seizure and pain medication. Upon arrival here in 2018 I was placed on a top bunk and was refused my seizure medication, which cause me to have a seizure in my sleep falling five feet to the concrete floor. Now I have permanent damages to my back, shoulders, and arms, and neck because the nurse did not put my medication in the computer.</br></br>

I am just thankful to be alive so now I sleep on the floor because I have bad dreams of falling out of the bed. Now I have PTSD so I am in a cell all by myself, me and God the Father, God the Son and God the Holy Spirit, amen! So it is very good that I believe in the Bible. That is where I get my strength from everyday.</br></br>

Noon and night I read, study, and pray for other people.</br></br>

I want to help people and encourage them that this too shall pass, so we must keep God first. What I have learn is to love God with all of your heart, mind, and soul, and love your neighbor as you love yourself.</br></br>

Well I hope this will make the story list, I do have more stories if you want to hear more, please write me back, it would be highly appreciated</br></br>

Respectfully.</br></br>

So then by 8:00 am we are served breakfast which consist of eggs, beans, oatmeal, flour tortilla shell, one banana, and one milk on a plastic tray. You get 10 minutes to eat it and put the tray outside of your door. Then the nurses come to check your temperature to see if you have a fever or COVID-19 symptoms. In the process you get your lunch with your breakfast.</br></br> 

Which consist of two pieces of bread, two pieces of bologna, pretzels, four little cheese crackers and a little pack of sugar-free Kool-Aid. That is it until 8:00 pm tonight for dinner, which consist of more beans and rice, cornbread, a salad with just lettuce, no dressing, a piece of cake, no icing, and a little pack of Kool-Aid. A tray you would make for a little kid, serious.</br></br> 

They are getting $80,000 a year for us to feed us like this. You can have a TV in your cell if you buy for $200 a 15 inch and a radio. And you have to make a place for it to hang off of your bunk with shoe strings or sheets. You get clean clothes once a week, shower twice a week every three days.</br></br> 

Today they let us outside for one hour and then back in your cell. It is very crazy in here we go out every two weeks for an hour.</br></br>

You have to be mentally strong or you snap. A lot of people have committed suicide, I love myself too much for that. That is why I pray for everyone. We will get through this together.
