<em>This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Orange County Central Men's Jail.</br></br></em>

April 15</br></br>

Dear student,</br></br>

My neighbor on the rack next to mine received this letter from you making inquiry about what's it like in jail during COVID-19. I have been encouraging him to write you, but he’s reluctant for his own specific reasons. We’ve all got nothing, but time to kill in here, so many of us, so maybe he or others will come around.</br></br>

As for me, ever since I had a flu like sickness in February/March of last year. I’ve gone through the last year with breathing problems and difficulty catching my breath. Over a year ago I was in bed with a fever, chills, muscle aches, lots of hacking from my lungs, and a loss of appetite. I lost 15 lbs in 10 days.</br></br>

Those breathing problems made it difficult for me to breathe upon intake to the jail. My hands were cuffed behind my back for an extended period making my breathing even more labored. I don’t look unhealthy so it’s difficult to convey the distress I’m in to the deputy under these types of situations. I got light headed and finally laid on my side.</br></br>

Also, in the series of holding tanks which were at or even over capacity, the air became stagnant after a few hours as the room filled with carbon dioxide. For me personally, laying on the floor with my face up against the floor threshold crack was the only way I could suck oxygen and keep myself from going into an oxygen deprivation panic.</br></br>

Many people were already sleeping on the floor so it was not seen as unusual. After 18 hours crammed in cold hard concrete cells, you just want it to end.</br></br>

Eventually that phase died. We were all put in quarantine units with a cellmate that came in with us. If we were lucky we’d get the 30 minutes a day to get a phone call and/or a shower. Most of the time it was 15-22 minutes out of the cell.</br></br> 

Quarantine seemed an awful lot like administrative segregation punishment. The restrictions really took their toll on me both physically and psychologically. Seemed like many people were on some sort of drug called “Subutex”. I didn’t want to take a drug to get through it, but if I have to do it again, I’ll reconsider.</br></br>

Out of the 14 day quarantine, I was there 19 days. Most people slept to pass the time, but a psych-tech nurse would come around to wake them. I asked her, “For what? So they can stare at the walls?” After a week, she got me a Bible so I could have some reading material.</br></br> 

By the way, I turned in many medical slips and dental. My gums were bleeding and I had no toothbrush. My body started to have much worse health problems that they referred to as a “serious health condition”, but their answer was to wake me at 3 am to drink Gatorade. I don’t know any other healthcare that does that. After the third time, I was able to get them to stop as it was giving me dizziness, chest pains, and a racing heart.</br></br>

The concrete walls and floors of this place seem to suck the heat out of your body. After three weeks of cold sack lunches three times a day, the cold temperatures, and odd hours they wake us up; my body feels very beaten by those conditions. I’ve lost 30 lbs in my depression.</br></br> 

My interactions with the court seem like something out of a Kafta novel as it is apparent we’ve lost certain liberties in the legal proceedings due to the crisis. For starters I barely could hear my arraignment over the iPad, but I guess my bail went from 25,000 to 125,000. My second court “appearance” didn’t even happen as they waived it or something. I’m out of the loop.</br></br>

Everyone and everything is not operating well under these restrictive circumstances and unfortunately, inmates are affected the worst of all by the changes. No hot meals at all for four and a half months. Maybe one visit a month from your people.</br></br> 

My neighbor claimed he has to have his attorney/client visit in a small room with another inmate and his attorney. His attorney whispered until they left. Many actions that you really can’t question in this state of emergency.</br></br>

As for me, I’m in the worst place in my life. The stress of the last year has put a strain on my family and being out of work has been hard on me. For some reason, my EDD benefits stopped after one payment after I mentioned head injuries. They put me in a disability category, so now I get neither EDD nor disability.</br></br>

I did get to go outside to the roof a couple days ago. First sunlight I saw in weeks. It was nice. Thankful for the small things.</br></br>

Sincerely.
