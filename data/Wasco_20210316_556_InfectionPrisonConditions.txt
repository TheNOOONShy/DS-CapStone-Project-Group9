Dear PrisonPandemic,</br></br> 

Greetings to you, it was brought to my attention by another prisoner that you were seeking information or stories about what has been going on during COVID-19 pandemic. So I will expound from October 16, 2020 the day that Wasco State Prison was placed on what prisoners at this facility which in my opinion resulted in a major uptick in exposure. I personally tested positive for SARS CoV 2 RNA (COVID-19) on February 1, 2021 reference range: not detected according to the notification sent to me by the Medical Department.</br></br>  

I however never felt any illness, in fact the aches and pains that I felt seemed the same as I normally fell due to my age. Then as far as the chills I felt, I normally feel a chill in this cell due to the cold air that flows out of the vent all the time which would be a blessing in the summertime, but I did not equate it with being sick. However Prisoncrats moved out of the building I am housed approximately 10 or so prisoners that did not test positive to another building, though all for the most part were brought back as positive and placed on isolation in building 3.</br></br>  
 
My blood pressure, and temperature was taken mostly, one time a day, sometimes two, and I was asked if I felt any symptoms, to and after about 14 days or so I was removed from the isolation list but keep on the quarantine list which resulted in my being continually denied access to the law library even though I have been (PLU) Priority Legal User as clarified at 15 CCR §3122(b) though I was still sent inmate priority passes.</br></br>  

Interestingly enough, on or about January 2021 being a member of the member at the Facility A M.A.C (Mens Advisory Committee) I attended a meeting with custody staff and medical staff regarding the issuance of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine to all prisoners that chose to take the shots, however if a person tests positive, they could not get the vaccine for 90 days.</br></br>  

This occurring at a very curious time, since these shots were supposed to be issued on February 8, 2021, but on February 1, 2021 what appears to have been a mass infection seemed to have taken place so 80% of the population according to the information packet that was issued telling the prisoners what the Moderna vaccine was were effectively ineligible to receive the vaccine.</br></br>  

Since building 3 was on quarantine/isolation, there was no outside movement unless supposedly approved by clinical staff. No dayroom activities, basically, the program was what I recognize to be lock-down as it was clear that we had nothing coming. Food was brought to the cells on paper trays.</br></br> 

During the time that I was supposedly infected, I was not given any form of medication, nor were 85% of those who are said to have been infected provided with any medication to my knowledge, we all basically soldiered through it as most did not have a serious symptoms which I would say is a good thing. However not that building 3 is off isolating quarantine, the prisoners are now being offered the Johnson COVID-19 vaccine which was finally given to me on March 10, 2021 and today medical staff are in the building issuing the single shots to all prisoners that appear to want the shot which again has resulted in my being denied access to the law liberty since custody staff seem to feel that only their workers need to come out and basically shut everything else even though the daily program status report part A-plan of operation/staff & inmate notification states “law library plu.”</br></br>   

I hope that this has been helpful to you, as in considering all the concern that was expressed about the COVID-19 on the news, I had thought that if I caught the virus, I would become very sick, yet according to what I have experienced, it was nothing to me. I guess I should chalk that up to good genes and a healthy diet for the prison environment as I am sure that these Prisoncrats hoped that a prisoner like me would have become extremely sickly and perhaps die, but as it turns out, I have done rather well.</br></br>  

I hope all is well with the team members of the PrisonPandemic Project, and do have a very pleasant COVID-19 safe day.</br></br>  

In solidarity & struggle.
