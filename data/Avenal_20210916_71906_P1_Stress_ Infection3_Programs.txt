This story was told by a person incarcerated at Avenal.</br></br>Caller: But, outside of that, you know, the pandemic, the COVID, we were isolated. You know, no visits, limited access to the other inmate population. A lot of us were going stir crazy, you know.</br></br>

I did see the, our, the prison that I'm at here, it seems like they were behind in prevention. So, once one person got it, it just took off like a wildfire. I think about 90 percent of the building that I'm in tested positive for COVID, including myself. And like I said, we didn't get our vaccines until, like, six months after.</br></br> 

And just recently they've opened up the program again where people are going to work and vocations. It's still limited, you know. We usually go to vocation five days a week and now we're only going two days a week. So, it's been bad. What else do you guys want to know about and I'll tell you about it?</br></br>

UCI: Well, first, thank you so much for sharing all of that. I really appreciate it, it means a lot to us.</br></br>

Caller: Is there anything in particular you guys are looking for?</br></br>

UCI: Anything, anything about your experience. Like, how did you cope with all of this?</br></br>

Caller: It was rough, you know. You know what I did do? I signed up for a pen pal service and that was kind of cool. I guess, you know, because everyone was sitting at home doing the same thing we're doing, I signed up for a pen pal service.</br></br> 

And that was cool. I was able to, you know, get some mail and meet some people. I met a couple of people in the UK, I met a couple of people across the United States, a couple of people right here in California. So, I was able to, you know, stay occupied. I work out every day, so I was able to occupy some of my day working out.</br></br>

I wrote letters. I do, do correspondence college classes. I'm actually a student at [redacted] college as well as [redacted]. So, I'm working towards my AA right now.</br></br> 

So, I was able to, during the COVID, because we didn't have anything to do, I was taking, you know, five to six classes a semester and really, like, you know, knocking it out. So, I was working on a lot of college. I called my family.</br></br> 

And then, outside of that, you know, it was just, you know, staying busy. I really consumed my days because, you know, like I said, we have very limited access to yard. We weren't going out, we weren't going to school, we weren't going to vocs, we weren't going to any of our self-help. We were literally trapped in the building for a year. That's, that's what we did.
