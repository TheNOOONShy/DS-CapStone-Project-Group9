Dear PrisonPandemic,</br></br>
	
I am an inmate here in Calipatria State Prison. I was sentenced to 25 to life due to a third strike for punching a custodial officer.</br></br>

During my incarceration my child was born. How I wish I could’ve been out there for her. I wish I would’ve known I was going to be a father before I made this mistake. My father has custody of my daughter. My father brings her for visits. I have become real close to my father and to my daughter. My father has talked to me about Jesus Christ and encouraged me to read the bible. Since then I have changed my life.</br></br>

I have been here in Calipatria State Prison for 3 years. This place if full of drugs and violence. I wished I never seen. How I wished to be somewhere else.</br></br>

Visits was the only thing that I looked forward too.</br></br>

Since the pandemic life here has been very stressful.</br></br>

The inmates are moved to different housing units occupied with inmates who are positive with the virus. Then they are brought back here. The pandemic is very serious a lot of people have died. The COs do not disinfect anything or even offer disinfected. I am sincerely worried about getting the COVID-19 virus. I don’t know if my health will be able to fight the virus. I do not want to die. The staff here seem not to care.</br></br>

I do not feel safe. And it has been very stressful. The lockdown in a cell is seriously getting to my head. And I am truly worried about my family. I have not seen my family for almost a whole year. Just one month ago we barely got the video visits, but it only lasted for two weeks before they stopped it. Our housing unit was put back on quarantine. I was not able to get approved for an appointment for visit. Because only like 8 people get visit per week, only once a week and it only lasted for two weeks, before they stopped it.</br></br> 

It is very difficult. My daughter is only 4 years old. Her birthday was on December 31. I couldn’t even see her for her birthday. It is hurtful.</br></br>

I have changed my life. I pray everyday for my family and for people in need. Also that I will be free one day, to be a present father to my precious daughter. I am dedicated and I have hope that I will be with my daughter and my family.</br></br>

This is what gives me hope. I have faith in Jesus Christ I am doing my best.</br></br>

God Bless You – Truly</br></br>
