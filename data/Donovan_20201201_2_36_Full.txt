Caller: Hello, I'm calling about the situation here at Donovan State Prison. Yeah we are locked down and they are treating us like dogs and stuff. You know what I’m saying? They don't change our masks. They don't do anything. You know it’s - you know we're locked down, and there’s no movement right now. You know and it’s spreading around here. We don't know who got it. They’re moving guys and we don't know who got it or nothin', you know.
