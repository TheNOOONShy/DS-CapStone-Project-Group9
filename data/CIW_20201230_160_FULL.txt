Dear UC Irvine,</br></br> 

Hello. I believe that a good friend introduced us.</br></br> 

My bunkie and I wrote an article about some of the injustices that occur here in prison.</br></br> 

For starters, I would like to say I know where I am and I know what I did to come here. However, I am still human. I am a mother. I have feelings. I am 100% regretful for the selfish actions that I exhibited to come here. In the same breath, I have grown, healed, and been rehabilitated.</br></br> 

Therefore, certain staff members abuse their duties. Instead of helping to protect and serve and reinforce the rehabilitation process, they choose to stifle the healing process. Being in prison is like living in the twilight zone. If it's anything pertaining to common sense, there is none here.</br></br>

When the COVID-19 hit prison, the staff panicked and shifted inmates across the prison. Completely shaking any sense of comfort, stability, or even normalcy. How is it that the public doesn't have enough tests, but the prisons do? 

Now, the vaccine is for essential workers. Now it is here in prison. And possibly just like testing being made mandatory, or either suffer being moved out of your room. I am sure that the vaccine will be made mandatory.</br></br> 

Can you be forced to take a vaccination? Does that violate our rights? As of now, that is my biggest concern. Because as far as the lack of common sense, qualifications during the hiring process is a dead end.</br></br> 

Thank you.
