Hi my name is [Redacted]. I want to share and express my thoughts during this COVID-19 pandemic. For me, it was very difficult because everything was, everything was so confusing. I thought that it was only a quarantine but it was not like that.</br></br>
I have been locked up for a year. I know that I am a prisoner, but this year is more difficult because I spend more time in the cell. And when you’re behind a cell, your mind plays a really important role to control your thoughts, to control your stress during this lockdown because just seeing fellow inmates getting infected, you can only ask God to not get infected. But if I get infected, thank God I already got the two vaccines.</br></br>
I was still hurt for losing family members in Mexico but I think everything happens for a reason. It wasn’t just me going through this, I think this was global. We all go through this. I hope that everything ends this year 2021 because this year affected so many people who were infected with COVID-19. The storm has passed and peace and joy will come for all.
