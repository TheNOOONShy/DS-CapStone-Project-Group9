Hello UCI student, 

Thank you for your compassion and service. I was grateful when I received this letter because it felt as though society had turned its back on the women who are incarcerated. We are the last to be noticed. 

From your letter, you would like to know how we are faring. Well, this has been a difficult and trying time. First as a mother and grandmother, I feel the disconnect. My visits are during the holiday and the month of March, which is when the pandemic was taken seriously. At this time, we have no face to face although we have access to a kiosk that allows videos, again men are allowed yet mothers are denied? Both of my sons are essential workers and I worry a great deal.
