Question number two: How do you feel about your safety inside?</br></br>

I’m scared that I may have developed some long term serious side effects of COVID and I can’t count on medical to help me. I do not feel like medical was there for me. I feel like I have been used, manipulated, and lied to for a hidden agenda that they won’t talk about. I believe the hidden agenda was to purposely infect all of us in here before a certain date.</br></br>

I will not take the vaccine because I do not trust people who lie. I will no longer cooperate with temperature, heart rate, oxygen and swabbing tests because I’m done with being moved all over the institution for the hidden agenda.</br></br>

Question number three: What has it been like to have reduced visitation from family and loved ones?</br></br>

The one thing that was right about this whole process was to temporarily shut down visiting. A lot of diseases, and germs get passed onto staff and inmates, then it gets brought back to the population. I don’t have anyone who visits me but I think it is a good idea for CDCR to get out of their cave-man-mentality and bring technology in. So people can maintain all those important family ties.</br></br>

Question number four: How have you been coping with this crisis?</br></br>

At times I’ve been scared. I did not believe I was going to get better or have a medical team that cared or understood my pain. I had developed resentments and skepticism towards medical and CDCR. I take days one day at a time, hoping these symptoms will go away magically (like the nurse told me) but the fact remains, I don’t really know.</br></br>

Question number five: How have the vaccinations been going at your facility?</br></br>

They have been administering the vaccines the same way they have been treating us, with lies and deceit. Some nurses tell us that only those with certain underlying conditions can get it. Some say you have to be over 65. Some say we have to finish our 90 days of being resolved first.</br></br>

What they say versus what we see is two different things. We seen people who have refused testing of any kind get the shot. My 90 days are now up and I am expected to do their tests, the only problem is, I can’t trust them anymore.</br></br>

That is my story. I’m sure I left off a great deal. I’ve only been moved four times during this COVID experience. There are a lot of people who has been moved about eight to 12 times.</br></br>

I will tell people in here about you and your team and what you are trying to do. I will share with them your letter. I hope you can use this information. If you need me for anything else, just write me, and I’ll respond.
