Our food situation, I’m sure isn’t helpful. But a contributing factor to the risks posed to our mental well-being.</br></br>I’ve gone days feeling like I have no energy to do anything. All you want to do is sleep your life away, since staying up is sure remind you just how hungry you are. Imagine having had cold lunches for the past 18 years straight?</br></br>Just looking or thinking about cold sandwiches will sure to make you sick. So to have both lunch, dinner, and breakfast cold is a nightmare! Thank God breakfast is cold sandwiches. At least it’s cereal, and peanut butter jelly sandwiches and not mystery meat.</br></br> 

It’s what we call any meat we get cause its never real meat! But processed!</br></br>What we are being fed can’t be healthy! And I’m sure our recommended nutritional facts aren’t being met.</br></br>Now imagine feeling hungry and just thinking or talking about food makes your mouth wet. Only to see others around you eating burritos, chips, snacks, drinks, and whatever else is available. Through the jail commissary canteen this happens everyday.</br></br>For the first six months of the pandemic the county of Orange was giving each inmate a bag of free commissary worth about $10 dollars in this commissary. Every single Friday.</br></br>This was being provided since we weren’t receiving any hot meals, but like any good thing, that came to an end. Once the first lockdown restrictions were lifted, as quickly as they were back on, the county took advantage and stopped issuing free commissary bags (also known as our stimulus bags!)</br></br>I think I speak for everyone when I say, “we sure miss those stimulus bags!”</br></br>
Well, I have some good news, we just started getting warm oatmeal with our cold breakfast. For whatever that’s worth. I’ll tell you what thought, we’ll take it!</br></br>It’s better than nothing right? Again, I’m glad and genuinely grateful I have people who care about me kind enough to make sure I’m able to go to the commissary canteen. Pretty damn lucky or blessed! I’d like to think both.</br></br> 

Not bad for an East LA dude I might say!</br></br>For what it’s worth, I’d also like to say I share and I’m quite generous with my store. I don’t mind handing a soup or two to those who don’t get any. For I’ve had it done to me before as well.</br></br>But not everyone is like that. One can only hope things will get better, or to be home soon.</br></br>I want to thank everyone else who’s involved in this study. I really appreciate the letter and feel fortunate to be one to have received one of all people. Thank you!</br></br>
I mean that with all honesty. It really felt good to know people are thinking of us and trying to help make a difference in this life. And let me be one to tell you all, you already have! Thank you! You all are also in my thoughts and in my prayers.</br></br>I only hope you all have enjoyed my letters as much as I’ve enjoyed writing them to you all. I hope hearing this will bring you a smile just as I’m smiling now. Take care, stay safe, and stay healthy.</br></br>Sincerely.
