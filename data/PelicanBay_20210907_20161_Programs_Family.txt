This story was told by a person incarcerated at Pelican Bay.</br></br>

Caller: No. It's just kind of the only problem that I've ever seen is like, maybe, like the phone situation. The phone situation, because all of us that are made to be was basically – we don't have a job. Right?</br></br>

So they oppress you. Like, you know, a lot of our families, you know, we've lost family members and stuff. And they started like not allowing us to call – like make a call like, maybe, once a week or once every two weeks. You know what I mean?</br></br>

So that was – that's the only part that kind of sucked during this epidemic, you know, being able to reach out to our families and stuff, you know? And, you know, not knowing that people have passed away and stuff and, you know, not being able to get to the phone. You know?</br></br>

UCI: Mhmm.</br></br>

Caller: That's the only issue I had with this – since the epidemic has started. And it's been pretty much lockdown. You know? But, other than that, everything's pretty much been the same. You know?</br></br>

UCI: Wow. I'm really sorry to hear that.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah.</br></br>

UCI: And how have you been coping with these types of changes caused by the crisis?</br></br>

Caller: Well, actually, right here, it's kind of not too much of a difference. We're pretty much, they were pretty much – we're pretty much locked down most of the time. We do get yard like two hours a day, you know, when we're functioning normally.</br></br>

But it's – other than that, it's pretty much the same. They recently started giving us concrete yard for like, maybe, approximately an hour, like every other day or every three days. But, other than that, we just – we've basically been just locked down.</br></br>

Locked down, and canteen has been brought to us and we've just been confined to our quarters. You know?
