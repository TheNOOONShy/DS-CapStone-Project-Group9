This story was told by a person incarcerated at San Quentin.</br></br>

UCI: What was it like just, I mean, when the cases first started, the fear must have been incredible. I mean, you know, what kind of environment that you're in, that it's a closed environment.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah.</br></br>

UCI: How did you cope? How did everyone around you cope with that?</br></br>

Caller: The fear was palpable for a lot of guys. You know, in prison you kind of have to buck up a little bit. You know, you're always there, somebody is- that's the one thing about Quentin and these programming prisons, there's somebody always ready to listen.</br></br>

So you can talk, you can say- you can, and there's enough inner strength to say “I am afraid.” But it was there. And a lot of guys, were- very few people were voicing all the, “it's nothing, don't worry about it.”</br></br>

People weren't saying that. Saying, “I understand. I understand.” And the medical staff was good. You know, they had their hands tied, it must have been incredibly frustrating for them.</br></br>

Because there was only so much that they were allowed to do within this context. Prayer, meditation, talking to friends, voicing it, writing letters. I mean, I wrote some really weird letters.</br></br>

People were like- when I got out to and talked to em they said, man, we got those letters, and  said oh my god, this isn't [redacted], you know, but I guess I, there's a, there's a real emotional component to COVID. And in that kind of a situation, you kind of say- in that situation, it's like, it's the anxiety is even worse. So you have to just ride it out sometimes.
