This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Soledad.</br></br>

Your first question is "What has it been like inside prison during this time"? Back in March as this pandemic was ramping up, those of us paying attention knew that it was a matter of time before it made its way into prison.</br></br> 

What we did not realize was that because this prison is in Monterey county, as are the majority of migrant workers that do not have the means to avoid the pandemic by using precautions advised, that the virus would get here as fast.</br></br>

The guards at this prison are primarily Hispanic. So it puts them even closer contact with the Hispanic population, than probably others. You then couple that with the fact that most guards here are ignorant (ignorant, not stupid) to the seriousness of this situation at this prison.</br></br> 

They have negative attitudes towards inmates and negative attitudes in general, and that is a recipe for disaster.</br></br>

Many comments like, "heh heh, that's one way to lower the prison population." As I write this, the news, KION CBS news, here locally, just aired a piece about this virus exploding in the California prisons. And here where I am specifically, as of today December 23rd, there are 839 positive cases here.</br></br>

I'll go chronologically as this thing progressed. The first thing that they did was to stop all contact visiting before a single case of COVID was in here. Smart move, yes. However, it also spotlights how incompetent the staff here have been in dealing with this pandemic.</br></br>

The spread in here was not inevitable. It was preventable, but poor attitudes, and poor administrative oversight, allowed it to enter the prison. For example, as soon as it was recommended by the CDC that people wear masks, within a reasonable amount of time, the prison issued us cloth masks that the inmate in Prison lndustry Authority (PIA) aka modern-day slavery, sewed us up for us to wear.</br></br>

There still was no known case here yet. Even though it was mandatory for all inmates and staff to wear masks, many staff scoffed at wearing them and inmates wearing them was not forced. Another example, it was known very early on that this virus was transmittable via dogs and cats, at least as carriers.</br></br>

The facility I am in has a service dog program. But because some staff here are involved with the entity that provides the dogs, possibly monetarily. And the fact that the program makes the prison look good,(lipstick on a pig?)the dog program continued for weeks possibly months. Rotating the dogs in and out of the prison to the public.</br></br>

The dogs reside here with their handlers all week. And then are picked up by the K9s for life entity that provides them or correctional staff for weekend public outings. Then after a weekend of licking, snilling, eating, petting, rolling in contaigonville, the dogs were brought back here to the isolated inmate population.</br></br> 

The staff were going to get those feathers in their hats, deadly global pandemic be damned. They still are taking the dogs in and out!
