UCI: And what have you been - how have you been coping with the crisis? Is it - has it been tough, stressful?</br></br>

Caller: I'm happy go lucky. I mean, I think it's exciting. You know, I mean, I think everyone is gonna get it, eventually, you know? Or at least, a lot of people are. And if you do get it, I mean, most people are surviving it.</br></br>

If you do get sick, I mean, you've always got the hospital to try to take care of you. And then - I mean, you don't want to think about it, but if you do pass away, you pass away. Me, personally, I'm not - I wasn't really concerned about it.</br></br>

I mean, I would take any precaution I could to not contract it and every precaution I could to be safe while having it. Not trying to give it to others and taking care of my own health. But I caught it and I personally got over it in two weeks. And I got the shot, the two step.</br></br>

So, I think that's three times I come in contact with it, I think that's what they say is pretty much, you're out of the woods at that point. So, I, personally, I mean, I'm not in the hospital, the quarantine dorms. So, it's like you only see what's on the news. If it wasn't for me seeing that, I wouldn't even be scared because you wouldn't see anything.</br></br>

You don't hear about it or see it. Me, personally. So, pretty much all I see is what's on the news as far as the hospital and the quarantine dorms. I don't see it. I mean, if somebody got sick during the day, I saw one person go out in a wheelchair.</br></br>

I mean, you don't - you don't ever follow up with what happened to that person. Could have been COVID, could have been another incident. So, I mean, yeah. I mean, as bad as it sounds and seems, it's like you don't really see - you only see numbers. Numbers on the news. So, yeah, I don't - I don't really know.</br></br>

UCI: Do you think your facility did a good job in handling the situation or do you think they could've done something better?</br></br>

Caller: I mean, actually, I think they did a pretty good job. The biggest thing was isolating people and then getting the shot. And so, they did pretty much an A plus job on that.</br></br>

Maybe they could have came a little quicker with the - with the booster shots, but I don't know. That's a policy issue, it's not really a safety issue.
