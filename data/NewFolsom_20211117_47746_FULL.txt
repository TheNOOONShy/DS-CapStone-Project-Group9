This story was told by a person incarcerated at New Folsom.</br></br>

Caller: The main thing is that here at state prison, the pandemic issue basically has not been taken that serious. The unit that they had as a medical facility for the COVID testing and stuff, they have shut that down, and now it’s being used as a facility, training facility for the COs to go down there and train, which they shut down our program and everything.</br></br>

They’re no longer providing, you know, they don’t pass out disinfectant for inmates to clean themselves and to be sanitized, and clean and everything. The spray bottle we had for the phone is no longer out here. They don’t take everything seriously.</br></br> 

Inmates are walking around without masks on in the dayroom and the kitchen. The people, the inmates, that are serving our food and stuff, they wear a mask that is up under their chin.</br></br>

So basically, the whole safety and procedures, these memos they sent out to us about safety precautions and all this crazy kind of stuff, they don’t care about it. They pass out the paperwork, but the COs are not pushing these issues to make sure that everybody is sanitized, clean, and taking the steps. So, and with the, what is that, new delta virus, which also indicates that you can be fully vaccinated but you can still catch the virus and may not get sick or anything but still pass it on to other people.</br></br> 

And when you go outside, most of the yard officers nobody is wearing masks. Going through the little rotunda to go to medical, you know, these people are not wearing masks and this and that.</br></br>

And then come to find out that the warden is signing numerous medical, religious, medical religious passes for our COs not to be vaccinated for religious belief and medical relief. Even though one of the COs was working over in medical when I went and was talking about this and was telling the other CO about it in front of me.</br></br> 

Okay, this guy was saying that he caught COVID, but he is not going to take the vaccine and he feels that he’s, I forget the word for it, that he can’t catch COVID because he already had it, that he’s not taking other people’s safety into consideration because the men didn’t wear masks. The man is standing right in front of me, putting on handcuffs and stuff, and you know, what about my safety?</br></br>

So you’ve got all of these COs running around here that are unvaccinated, that are not taking the protocol and the safety procedures and stuff and caring about everybody. Not only, not just the inmates, but what about the coworkers? So as far as all the safety protocols and everything that they’re putting out, it’s not what it seems.</br></br> 

Everything is basically totally different from what they’re putting out to be. So, the safety procedures is not there.</br></br>

Other issues that basically we have going on is the racism and stuff. They’re attacking the Black inmates. Basically, in March of 2021, they started bringing white inmates on the facility because they didn’t have any on this yard at first.</br></br> 

All the ones that were here was non-affiliate. They kicked them off the yard. So basically, they’ve been targeting all the Black inmates, taking their jobs to give to the White inmates. But the Hispanic inmates and stuff, they’re not taking none of their jobs.</br></br>

When a cell comes open, if a Black person in there, they’re writing up Black inmates, forcing them to take cell mates when you have empty cells. And you have Hispanic inmates that have seven or eight to 10 cells all by themselves, and you’ve got one in a cell, but they won’t say nothing to them. But they’re pressuring the Black inmates to take cell mates or be written up.</br></br>  

Within the last six months, they have viciously assaulted Black inmates, brutally beating them with about like seven to eight COs jumping on them and stuff. And then they write the inmates up for assault and battery on a CO when the COs are initiating the violence and jumping on these inmates.</br></br>

And when it comes to the job situations, like special skill jobs, they have no Blacks in these positions. As if we're not qualified and we’re not good enough to hold these positions and all the special training jobs or positions. So basically, it’s degrading, and they’re targeting us by race.</br></br>

And the procedures - the other thing I wanted to point out that they can look at, they’ve got a new appeal process where we can no longer appeal issues at the institutional level. They call it a grievance. So, by calling - by not getting - by putting it as a grievance, it’s no longer binding to the institution as a legal term.</br></br> 

So now they’re holding the 602 grievances, which is supposed to be a 602 appeal, they hold it, they hold it past 60 days, and once they go past the 60 days, they say, "Oh well, this is the only response you get because we passed the 60 days, you don’t get a response," because they failed to respond within 60 days.</br></br>

And then, when you go to file it, the appeals office has been holding inmates' appeals over a year. I have about 10 of them that they have held over a year, and then they sent it back to me, and they say, "Well, we passed the 60-day time limit, so this is the only response, and there is no longer need for you to proceed with this appeal." So, they’re violating our due process with appeals, the pandemic, with the COVID-19, racism, and all this other kind of crazy stuff.</br></br>

But this is getting ready to shut off within 60 minutes - 60 seconds, they shut it off. I just wanted to give an update, and I will be writing and giving in more details of everything. Therefore, I just wanted to basically say because I got this letter, wanted to let you guys know that I will be writing again and giving more information.</br></br>

UCI: Okay, thank you so much for your call. I appreciate you sharing everything in your letters.</br></br>

Caller: Okay, you have a nice day.
