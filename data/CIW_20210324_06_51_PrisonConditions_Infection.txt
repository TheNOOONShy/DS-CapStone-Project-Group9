This story was told by a person incarcerated at CIW (California Institution for Women).</br></br>

UCI: I've got a couple other questions for you.</br></br> 

Caller: Uh huh.</br></br> 

UCI: So starting from the very beginning of the pandemic, would you say, so month by month, I mean, I know it's kind of hard to think back it in 'cause I'm sure so much has happened since then, but starting from the very beginning. Say like last March through, through the month and through the summer and then through the winter time and the spike that happened.</br></br>  

How was the situation at your facility like? Nobody paid attention to it? Nobody took it seriously at first and then they started taking it seriously once-</br></br> 

Caller: At first the officers were laughing and joking 'cause we’re swearing if they had it before, which a lot of us, even the inmates, believe that we did because prior to March. We had that November thing that the United States was recognizing as a flu, a different kind of flu, and that's what they advertise it as. And so when I was deathly ill then, it was told to me that I just had, oh, it's the flu symptom, not, you know, they haven't given it the COVID-19 name.</br></br> 

So then I went on and I recuperated four months later, I came up on March and that's when they slammed the whole prison and we stayed slammed for a long time.</br></br> 

But the officers, when they originally started out giving them temperature checks and things like that, they stopped that at the gate. So after like, 60 days, 90 days and they stopped doing it. Then it was, oh well, you test if you feel like. Well if they don't have, if they’re a systematic, then, asymptomatic, how are they going to know to test? You get it?</br></br> 

UCI: Yep, and then as far as-</br></br> 

Caller: Go ahead.</br></br> 

UCI: I'm sorry go ahead.</br></br> 

Caller: No, go ahead.</br></br> 

UCI: I was gonna ask so they weren't taking it seriously. They stopped doing the temperature checks. You know they stopped paying attention to it and then?</br></br> 

Caller: Right. They stopped them. They stopped them coming in at the gate from doing temperature checks where they were down to like once a month, random or something like that. But even from there, their whole sadness is, you have a lot of decent officers that work here that work hard.</br></br> 

They're trying to give you, trying to give us our state issue. And they're bombarded with doing the work of somebody else, because guess what? That person didn't show up, so if you have a grumpy officer then this what the kind of quality that you get?</br></br> 

You know my dilemma was simple. Because the housing units that I was in, the officers we're in some kind of like semi romantic relationship. So they didn't want to open the day room, which is where you use the telephone, which is where you get on the kiosks, which is where you walk around, outside of your cell activity.</br></br> 

And they didn't want to separate themselves long enough to let us get out, so I've been through a living hell. I've been nine days locked in my room straight without a break in here. That's not even counting outside, outside with fresh air because all food was brought to us on trays, you know.
