This story was told by a person incarcerated at Soledad.</br></br>

Caller: Like the self-help groups.</br></br> 

Oh, man, so many lifers in particular who are still going to board telephonically. They're not going to any self-groups, they're not able to self-improve in any meaningful way sitting idle staring across the dorm, and another guy, 24 hours a day. So, that's kind of just, you know, I see some guys come back with denied paroles and that just didn't have to be the case.</br></br> 

There's just, they're just not being exposed to programming that could help them learn some tools to, you know, look inside themselves and do some exploring and understand what brought them to prison. I know this stuff because I facilitated groups myself prior to COVID shutdown.</br></br> 

So, it's a little extra frustrating to myself because I was running these groups. But I get how much they helped these guys. I've seen these guys come through these groups, especially, particularly, these minimum.</br></br>

And they come up out of their parole hearings with some pretty good results, you know, just takes a little bit of self-exploration. And they're not getting that now. So, it just doesn't seem to me anything positive is coming out of this lack of programming. That's a big one.
