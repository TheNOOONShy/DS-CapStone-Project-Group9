First of all not all prisons are the same as being a inmate in a California prison for well over 20 years I have never been as scared as I am right now. And I have been through it all. When COVID hit this yard that I am on not less than 48 hours later there was over 600 inmates that tested positive for COVID-19.</br></br>

We don’t know how it got to us but it did. Now all 600 of us were placed in buildings away from other inmates which was expected, and we were all thankful for that. So now that they can focus on helping us to get better, but it really didn’t happen like that. We sat here and waited.</br></br>

The administration of this prison spread the COVID-19 to other yards at this prison they moved people that had cellys that were infected with COVID-19 to other yards for what reason is beyond me. There was no excuse for it. The other yards got COVID-19 within days. As well some yards got it week after, but it was all spread by their doing.</br></br>

We have on B yard were locked in our cell which was to be expected.</br></br>
