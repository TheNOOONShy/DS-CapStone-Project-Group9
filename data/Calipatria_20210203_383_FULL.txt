Hello,</br></br>

I just received your most blessed and surprised letter. I loved the pyramid and the moon with clouds and a beautiful tree I'm assuming it is. So, yeah, you filled my eyes with tears and brought a smile to my face after reading your letter.</br></br> 

Thank you for even taking the time out of your life to even write me. I realize it's part of a class or team at UCI but no matter what it is, I’m thankful for it. And it just never came to my mind that people care what’s happening inside of these prison walls.</br></br> 

This COVID is killing a lot of people everywhere. And, yes, you can be my guest to hear how it's affecting me personally. So, yeah, it's bad due to not being able to see my wife [redacted], my only sister [redacted], my mom who's 73 now and has many illnesses. And just yesterday I called my wife to find out my dad who's 75 is in the hospital. And so all day yesterday I’ve been crying for him, and just being sad, because I know how he feels.</br></br> 

It’s been 21 years the last time I physically saw him. I saw my mom up in High Desert along with my sister before this crazy pandemic.</br></br> 

So where’s Sunland? I’ve never heard of that city. I thought UCI was in Irvine. That goes to show how long we been gone out of society. It's cool. I deserved to be punished and taken off the streets. I broke the law for being desperate for money to pay rent, car payment, bills.</br></br> 

When I was fired from my last job as a tow truck driver at AC Towing in San Clemente. Figures everyone hates tow truck drivers like they hate lawyers. Ha ha. Why is that? Anyways.</br></br>

I’m coping with this by reading the Bible and just by faith, love, and being positive. If not it would have killed me years ago. I just turned 50 Christmas Eve. So it's a miracle. GOD is carrying me. I’m not sure if you believe in him or her, they say we're made from his image. Who knows. It's a complicated book.</br></br> 

So yeah you can use my story, for historical purposes. They don’t have to be anonymous. It's no secret I'm in here. So, yeah, whatever you need, I'll be 100% with you. So far the prison reform has been going good. This new president is more down to earth, unlike Trump who is out of this world, crazy. It would of started a riot-incited it, by my words, and five or even one person was killed I’ll be charged with murder 187, no bull.</br></br> 

I knew the guy who started the riot in Pelican Bay in 2000 on B-Yard where the guards just shot and killed a guy. He was charged with that, was given a life sentence. Then he was SHU-Segregated Housing Unit, and hang himself. So, yeah, there’s a double standard when it comes to the law.</br></br> 

So I’m watching The Late Show with Stephen Colbert. Haha, I was confusing him with another night show host. It's very funny. Watch it one of these days. The first 10 minutes are very accurate on all matters. These QAnon people are just like Trump, out of their mind.</br></br> 

So today I was offered the Moderna vaccine. But it scares me because I am in good health and not so far has got this virus. I’ve never taken the flu shot either. So I got all the info about this rushed vaccine and the FDA never approved it, yet made it an emergency to go ahead and experiment on people.</br></br> 

So I read all these side effects and the ingredients and no bueno. Everybody should do the research first. So I’m gonna wait. Our bodies have antibodies immunities to viruses. Say we're back in 1800, would we be getting vaccines? I seriously doubt it. Course we have designed T-cells to fight off sicknesses. You know all this. Everyone does, it's basic.</br></br> 

So yeah, positive reform, I'm all for that. I’ve changed since pulling armed robberies. I've learned it's wrong, and how much pain and difficulties I've caused everyone. I was self-centered and crazy for what I did.</br></br> 

It was never my intention to hurt, kill anyone. That's why I took off the bullets. I didn’t want the gun to go off accidentally, but I know they still thought they might die or get shot. I regret my actions, I made poor bad choices. A lot of my decisions were altered by my drug use. I wish I never used drugs. It's bad, if I could stop just one kid from doing hard drugs--coke, heroin, meth--I’ll advise not to start.</br></br> 

Well I’m getting off track, I hope this letter helps your team with the PrisonPandemic.</br></br> 

All I can say is... I pray we all as humans can beat this and get back to normal. All I do all day is think of how to better myself and change myself, so that I don’t make the wrong choices again. I miss my wife, I miss my family, and being in prison takes all that away.</br></br> 

I hope that one day there is no more prisons. Well at least none the way they are now. I’m not sure but it needs to be different. A lot of us, we're angry, abused, and didn’t have dads or positive role models growing up.</br></br> 

We need to address that in here. So far it's a slow start, but I see it with all the rehabilitative self-help classes we have now in prison, whereas before nada--just throw us in our tombs and leave us to rot. So yep things are looking brighter for us. Well for me, plus after hitting 50 all the BS is not necessary.</br></br> 

Life's too short to waste. Sorry I can't draw too good. My pen just ran out of ink. This is my new pen. Better to write with.</br></br>

So, I hope this letter helps all your team out. I’m sending you a picture also so you can add to my story. Share it with the world. Tell them prison is a bad place and nothing exciting, or funny, about being in gangs or using drugs.</br></br> 

I thank you in reaching out to me and telling me people are thinking of me, of us during these tough times. And after spending 21 years in prison, it's eye opening, and not a place for anyone.</br></br> 

So stay out of trouble, think about everything you say or do, cause it's all about karma and whatever you put out comes back. The universe is based on cause and effect--all your actions come back to you. So see the light, so you won’t have to see the darkness ever. Thank you and God bless you and the team at UCI. I'm in prison but I'm free inside.</br></br> 

Sincerely.
