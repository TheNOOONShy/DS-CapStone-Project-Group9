This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Soledad.</br></br>January 30, 2021</br></br>Dear PrisonPandemic,</br></br>I am writing you to verify that you are interested in information in reference to prison conditions during the pandemic. Is that correct?</br></br>Our facility went on modified program on March 18th 2020, and has been dealing with trying to protect people that work and are institutionalized here from being exposed and then of course when they are exposed from spreading the virus and attempting to provide the space and conditions to safely clear the virus.</br></br>At first, it went fairly well at our facility. That is until August of '20, when we had our first cases at Central facility. It has been an absolute battle since that time and now we are in the middle of an outbreak that has overtaken more than half of the prisoners and hundreds of staff.</br></br>I have been on the Men's Advisory Council since July of Ô19. I was made Secretary in August of Ô19, which means I have been the person responsible to keep records of all activities on the facility from the perspective of the population up until last week, when I became the chairperson.</br></br>I have kept a daily log of activities starting in February of '20 and continue to do so presently. The information that I have recorded is non-partisan, free from opinion or political or bureaucratic motivation, and does not try to lay blame on any individual or organization of people for what has transpired. It is simply a factual record.</br></br>If you care to ask my opinion about what has transpired over the last year, I would be more than happy to share it, but it is only that; an opinion. To be honest not many people seem to care in this setting what I think; especially staff. But, I digress.</br></br>I do not remember where I recorded your address, but if I am correct about your purpose and quest for information I may have something that could benefit your project, and hopefully therefore scientific understanding of pandemics in institutions in general.</br></br>If you are interested please contact me by standard US mail at the above entitled address.
