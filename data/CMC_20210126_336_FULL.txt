UCI Student,</br></br>  

First and foremost, I pray that my words find you and all those concerned with the welfare of those of us incarcerated, in good health. It is, in my own way, an underestimated blessing.</br></br> 

One of the brothers was kind enough to pass your words along, figuring I’d be interested in writing, so here I am.</br></br> 

To begin, COVID-19, and its surrounding effects are surreal at best. Never could one have imagined - save a fiction writer, that those of us in prison would have so many restrictions impairing our lives... both directly and indirectly related to society.</br></br>

Directly, because the pandemic, the virus itself has reached us. I myself had it, though I was asymptomatic, nevertheless the bug bit me. I was moved from my housing unit, and rehoused in a quarantine building, for a period of 28 days. The catch is, I actually caught COVID in quarantine.</br></br> 

The night I left they were doing random temperature checks. I’d just drunk a cup of tea, so quite naturally my body temp was a little high (98.3), and once this was reported to the main nurse, they decided to move me to the quarantine building under the falsehood that my temp would be checked the very next morning. It was. I wasn’t moved.</br></br>

Unfortunately, everybody over there actually had it, and since the prison (at the time) had absolutely no cleaning ritual (they’ve since adopted a makeshift cleaning response - which is only slightly better), I was housed with and around men that not only displayed the symptoms, some of whom had to be hospitalized, I ended up getting the virus as well.</br></br>

At best the rehousing wasn’t a horrible episode, time-consuming maybe, a hassle for sure, but the problem is that we only catch it (and this is one of the indirect responses) because staff absolutely (most of them) refuse to wear masks. Some men have died. One, a lifer like myself, the board didn’t want to give him a compassionate release, died mere weeks before he was set to be released. I had to witness and experience the heartache behind this tragedy.</br></br> 

Now truth be told I am unable to see loved ones during this period, but I am not one to get many visits as it is. After 30-plus years, the only concerns I have is whether or not they’re okay; I don’t actually need to see them. But the keeping in touch with them has been greatly affected, because like now, even though I just tested negative, we’ve been (excuse me) were quarantined because a man in this building tested positive.</br></br> 

After testing us, and even though the test came back negative, they quit dispensing with the semantics and just placed us on lockdown. No man left (according to science...) has quarantined, yet we’re locked down. That isn’t the only tragedy. Well, not the only one in a line of many.</br></br> 

But, if a man has board or any related activity, he can not go to board. Again, this is after testing negative, which will cause him to spend at least another six months or so in prison. We have to remember, though, we’re only talking about inmates. Right?</br></br>

Our lives in here (when we’re allowed what one would refer to as recreation activity) between 40 and 50 minutes of yard every day, 15 of which (if one can gain access) will be spent on the telephone. Otherwise, we’re allowed to walk around the yard - staying six feet apart, mind you, which on its face doesn’t comport with common sense, because science says none of us have it, and the only way we’ll get it is in close contact with staff.</br></br> 

Being that I’m currently on lockdown, the only out-of-cell time I am allowed is a 15-minute shower every 72 hours. That’s it.</br></br> 

Now, as ex-gang members from Los Angeles, and realizing the harms I inflicted upon not only my victims, but society as a whole, do I have a right to complain? No. And to be frank, I’m not. I get pissed at times, but at the end of the day, I put myself here.</br></br> 

While COVID-19 and its surrounding hassles may not be liked, people in society are currently facing far worse. I’ve come to understand what pain is and suffering is. Because I was asymptomatic, I’ve suffered no great loss. I still get fed three meals (even though I have my own food), I have a warm bed and a television. Not to mention a typewriter.</br></br>

Corona has been a horrible disaster reeked upon the lives of those most vulnerable and this is the part that really bothers me. The number of businesses lost, the deaths, and the people shuttled to and from hospitals like cattle. These are the things that trouble me. Men, women, and children that no longer have the reliance of a steady (if not wobbly) pay check that was once there, now (like so many others that are less fortunate) have to wait for food banks and the like (if they have access at one) or risk going without, period. These are the things that bother me now.</br></br>

Where once I was so selfish and all too consumed with me, I now look at the world and as Black man I am deeply ashamed at what I not only contributed to (regarding gangs and the like) but likewise the potential wasted. Lives are being lost on a daily, while others are constantly being affected, and it is with this backdrop that I cannot honestly complain. </br></br>

COVID-19 has been a terrible, almost haunting, disease, and given the fact that a majority of the corrections officers - I can’t say for sure if it’s officials too, officials being the administrators, but a lot of the officers say they simply will not take the vaccine. Me too, don’t get me wrong, but still.</br></br> 

Given this mentality, the disease will in fact persist for at least another year or more. But here’s the kicker: With staff, many of whom refuse to wear a mask out in society, which is like, ‘Okay, that’s your choice.’ But, because they don’t wear a mask, and if they test positive, then they have to get furloughed - for which they don't get paid. So, it’s directly affecting their paycheck.</br></br> 

Yet, so many believe what they want to believe. Thank you President Trump and Fox News. One would be remiss to throw a rock in here and not hit a correctional officer that (all, if not most, related to law enforcement are Republican by nature), believes that the virus is in fact a hoax. Really.</br></br> 

The deaths, flooding of hospitals, none of these register on the scale of reality. Don’t misunderstand, around administrators they are told to wear masks, but how often do administrators come around, for one, and two, at best it’ll only affect inmates. At least we believe that’s the rationale.</br></br>

Anyhow, I don’t know if you’ll be able to use this or not. Again, thank you for being concerned with those of us that are here, because believe it or not, while many of us (at one point) behaved inhumane, there are those of us who’ve gotten our humanity back.</br></br> 

Take care.
