This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Stockton.</br></br>

Picture this.</br></br>

Staring at yourself in a mirror for an hour, not recognizing yourself, your eyes appearing completely blacked out, as if you are possessed by something supernatural! At every slight headache, cough, sneeze, you convince yourself that you have Covid-19, and that you will expire in prison.</br></br>

At the end of 2020, I was told that one of my siblings contracted COVID-19 and had began quarantine at my mother's home. I was completely terrified!</br></br>

Not being able to call daily, worrying if everyone was okay. Also, with them living in the state of Pennsylvania, it makes it feel as if it's a foreign county in regard to the distance between us. I honestly don't feel as if I'm coping, more like survival of the fittest!</br></br>

In retrospect though, my overall nature, spirit, and character is of positive and righteous quality. We all shall prevail stronger after these historical, and unseen times. I read something that was very inspiring to me, I want to share with anyone it may empower.</br></br>

Until you can stand alone, looking for guidance neither to spirits nor mortals, gods nor men, but guiding yourself by the light of the truth within you, you are not unfettered and free, not altogether blessed, find the joy that results from well-earned freedom, the peace that flows from self-possession, the blessedness that inheres in native strength.</br></br>

Spirituality isn't just a particular religion, it's about having supreme faith in something greater than yourself, your problems, and circumstances. Life is a journey, a marathon. Love the blessings you have in your life, regardless of your physical position, financial status, or mistakes you've made!</br></br>

The COVID-19 pandemic has brought me to a more positive realization, of these important principles.</br></br>

Love someone</br></br>

Grow with someone</br></br>

Help someone</br></br>

Talk to someone</br></br>

And understand that the storm of this pandemic is evanescent.</br></br>

Although I'm physically incarcerated through the COVID-19 pandemic, I will remain focused, determined to be a better man through my redemption journey. I'm an avid realist.</br></br>
