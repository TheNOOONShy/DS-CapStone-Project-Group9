This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Kern Valley.</br></br>
Dear PrisonPandemic Team,</br></br>
Foremost, I am a 38 years old African-American male. I have been incarcerated since May 2001 on a first-degree murder charge in which I took a 50 years sentence as a plea bargain. In mid 2003, I came to prison in September 2003 shortly after conviction from Alameda county jail.</br></br>
However, I have been in prison in these places since Wayback then. Basically, I have spent half of my life in these penal-systems now. I came into this as a teenager, and now I am fully grown up as if yesterday never came. In my experience with this life, I truly have grown.</br></br>
I have been through a lot in my life and never allowed my past to keep me trapped in old behaviors. Due to this outcome, of my commitment, which is long term as reality has proven so far.  It's been a coronavirus pandemic for quite some time now. I know that it has caused a lot of distress in the world.</br></br>
With sudden death, and potential harmful cases of COVID-19 to all people on earth. Regardless of who is deemed the minority or majority on earth as a class of people everywhere here. I am glad I was able to get my two doses of Moderna vaccination already. While at Kern Valley Prison this year so far.</br></br>
It is a good feeling to have hope in some of these personal treatments these places can offer from time to time. Some of them can be helpful in ways. Personally, I am just trying to stay healthy because being in these places is detrimental to a person’s overall existence, especially when there is a lack and a lot of human basic qualities as well. I am very open to learning more about your services, plus make it something I can rely on for advice and support. May you stay at your best and respond back whenever possible. Peace and blessings.</br></br>
Sincerely,
