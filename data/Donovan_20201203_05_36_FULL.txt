This story was told by a person incarcerated at Donovan.</br></br>

UCI: What is the current COVID-19 situation at your facility?</br></br>Caller: During the entire pandemic, there has only been four documented cases of inmates contracting the coronavirus. There have been no cases on the housing facility which I am housed in.</br></br> UCI: And what is troubling or concerning to you?</br></br>Caller: For me, the greatest concern is that now that I'm in my advanced years and suffering from a variety of health concerns, this could actually prove to be a mechanism which I would meet an untimely demise to a disease. Other than any other factor which could, which could cause that to happen to me in a prison environment.</br></br> 
Caller: It's literally the mortality issue.</br></br> UCI: And how has your facility been dealing with this?</br></br>Caller: On the facility in which I'm housed, it is a what is called an in-field complex. The housing units contain four pods. They're shaped like an X. And each spoke of the wheel, so to speak, has 11 cells and each cell holds six prisoners.</br></br> 

So, it is dormitory settings. Though they're small, there's only six inmates per cell, they are dormitory settings and as such it is impossible to maintain a six-foot distance from other inmates cause you're just housed in such close proximity in a cell.</br></br> Well for as far as the administration and staff they do enforce the wearing of face masks. Most of the staff were lackadaisical in the wearing of face coverings themselves. Until just recently one of the prisoners in this facility filed a grievance against staff members of rank for not wearing their mask. That action was successful and now they've become very militant about wearing a mask and making sure that inmates do as well.</br></br> UCI: So, have they, from the beginning of the outbreak to now have they, besides the masks, have they made any other changes?</br></br>Caller: Yes. They have started placing dispensers of antiseptic hand sanitizer that is being produced by prison industry authority. They're putting that in the center areas of the buildings for inmate use.</br></br> 

The cleaning chemicals that are distributed to the inmate population on a weekly basis, they've been much more generous with the amounts of cleaning chemicals and the ability to access cleaning materials such as mops, brooms, scrub brushes, all of that has been increased exponentially. Basically beginning in about the month of June, they started really stepping it up on cleaning chemicals.</br></br> UCI: What do you think would make the situation at your facility better?</br></br>Caller: Number one, in light of the fact that it is literally impossible to maintain a safe distance from your co-inhabitants, the cells are equipped in such a configuration that there are two bunkbeds and then there are two single bunks.</br></br> 

If they were to remove the occupants of the top bunks, thereby decreasing the number of individuals per cell to only four instead of six it would alleviate the congested fact, excuse me, congestive factor and allow for a more appropriate social distancing, even inside the housing units themselves.</br></br> UCI: How has the COVID-19 situation at your facility affected your loved ones?</br></br>Caller: My loved ones, unfortunately I have outlived most of my family members.</br></br> UCI: Oh, sorry to hear that.</br></br>Caller: Where I'm at now is, for the most part, basically a geriatric care facility.</br></br> 

You have a vast number of elderly individuals who are mobility impaired. They're either in wheelchairs or utilize other assistive devices such as walkers or canes. And they're at severe high risk. There are a variety of individuals who are either hearing impaired or deaf. There's an entire deaf community on this yard.</br></br> 

You even have some visually impaired individuals. So, there's a plethora of individuals who fall under the category of the Americans with Disabilities Act and I got to tell you, the amount of care being given to these individuals is not what I would like to see it be.</br></br> UCI: Okay. So, how would you, or what are some recommendations or things that you would change to make the situation better for those individuals?</br></br>Caller: For the, for the individuals who are, for example, for the individuals who are under the Americans with Disabilities Act, a lot more care and caution should be made as far as the population itself, deep in the population and thereby reducing the contact.</br></br> 

The volume of cleaning supplies and means of keeping things sanitary in the housing units is sufficient. However, the number of cases here at this particular prison is so miniscule. We've only had four cases since the pandemic began.</br></br> 

Unfortunately, the administration still refuses to upgrade from the lower-level phase groups that control how much inmate movement, whether or not we are allowed contact visiting, and so on.</br></br> 

And these kinds of concerns, if individuals were to be allowed to have the appropriate level of face consideration that they should be having it would ease a lot of tensions and diametrically decrease the stress levels in the institutional environment, twelvefold.</br></br> UCI: What has it been like for you to have reduced visitation and-or programming?</br></br> Caller: As far as programming, what has impacted me, myself the most is I am a college student. In fact I am not being able to participate in classroom settings, which has been curtailed because of the pandemic, almost shut down college program entirely.</br></br> 

They had to drastically change the method in which homework was distributed and how br-, everything concerning the college program had to be completely revamped. By itself that was probably one of the biggest program deficit that occurred because of this pandemic.</br></br> UCI: And with this reduced programing how have you been able to cope with the crisis?</br></br> Caller: For myself I've continued to do my studies, my college studies on my own as best I can with the help of the college coordinators.</br></br>  

And as far as self-help groups, I may, actually I'm a facilitator of many groups here in, in the prison environment and we have made overtures to groups and organizations on the streets in order to obtain correspondence-based self-help programs. And once we get them we share them with the inmate population for those individuals wishing to undertake those kind of self-help groups, but that's what I've done myself.</br></br> UCI: And, um, what else do you want people to know about your experience?</br></br>Caller: There is an apathy that has become prevalent within the institutional environment, not just here at the facility I'm at. And the apathy that has become prevalent is that the system doesn't care and they're basing that on the outbreaks and spikes that have occurred in some other prisons here in the state of California and the general malaise is that the system doesn't care and that even if a vaccine or some form of combatant drug program were to be developed that prisoners would not be afforded that.</br></br> 

That is the fear that exists throughout the, throughout the entire prison system that we will not be afforded a vaccine or any type of treatment even when it becomes available on the streets.</br></br> UCI: Okay, and is there, um, I'm done with my questions but if you wanted to add anything else-</br></br> 

Caller: I will summarize by saying that I truly appreciate the effort. I hope that the information that you gather, will be used for good purpose.
