This story was told by a person incarcerated at Mule Creek.</br></br>

UCI: If there’s anything else that you’d like to share, anything else that you want people to know about your experience.</br></br>

Caller: Sorry, would you repeat that question or just something I want people to know about my experiences?</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, anything else that you’d like to share.</br></br>

Caller: It’s, it’s for sure an experience I never had before. Overall, you know, we prevailed in here. Yeah, we lost, I lost some friends over this stupid, this pandemic thing. I seen a lot of people fight and get beat up. It wasn’t cool, it was a rough experience.</br></br>

But for sure, man, my girl, man, she was there from the day one. I mean, she’s always been there for me but she’s always kept me positive. So, is this gonna be recorded on the website or just gonna write it down briefly on the website?</br></br>

UCI: Yeah so then afterwards it’s gonna be edited and then it’s, all your information, without your name and everything, your story that you said today is gonna be posted on the website so everyone can read it.</br></br>

Caller: I don’t mind sharing my name at all.</br></br>

UCI: We’re not allowed to, so even if you were to, it would just be edited out for safety reasons and everything.</br></br>

Caller: Okay because I was just talking to my girl right? And she was like “oh man give me a shoutout.” I’m like alright, I’m like I didn’t know because on the paper it did mention being anonymous.</br></br>

UCI: You’re always free as well, if you don’t call, you can always write in. You can always send drawings and everything as well. So if there’s anything you forgot today, anything additional you want to share. I’m not sure if her name would go through, but you can, anything you’d like to share, you can also write us and that will also be posted.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah gotcha, see I thought about writing but that’s like, time, I mean a lot of people think we have nothing but time in here but, like, man I stay busy. I’m in school, I work, I’m a representative for Hispanics so I address issues and this and that. So, I’m awfully busy so when you provide a number, I’m like that’s something I could do for sure.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, and then if your friends would like to call in in any language or if they would like to write in any language, I’m sure we can find someone as well. Thank you so much for participating in PrisonPandemic. Feel free to call back any time. Thank you so much.</br></br>

Caller: Thank you. Hey, if you can, would you mention how important it is to have loved ones stay connected? That does help a lot while you’re going through this experience.</br></br>

UCI: Yes.</br></br>

Caller: Just having that experience, like keeping in touch with the loved ones, that’s all that matters. I always worry about my family out there as well, not only for them to worry about me and it was hard.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, I completely understand.
