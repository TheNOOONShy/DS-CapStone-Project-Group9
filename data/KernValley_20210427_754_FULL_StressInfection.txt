This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Kern Valley.</br></br>

First I would ask that you not public my letter anonymously. I want the world to know what my take is. I am in poor health COPD, cancer, heart problems, neuro diseases, etc. I could care less about COVID-19.</br></br>

According to many scientists and doctors, the coronavirus scare is man made and only one percent of the people who catch it die. People like me old and sick, people who are already dying. COVID does not scare me. I do not worry about it. I believe the world has overjudge its capacity to kill.</br></br>

I believe the cure has become worse than the disease. I am a Black man. I have been set up and convicted multiple times. Starved, beaten, tortured, and sexually harassed by corrections officers and abused and neglected by prison staff. In prison the virus is not the problem.</br></br>
