This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Kern Valley.</br></br>
Now in response to your inquiry. Well, in regards to what it has been like to be inside during this difficult time. It has been difficult and very challenging. Due to the uncertainty and confusion that this pandemic has created.</br></br>
Visitation has been canceled without an unknown re-opening scheduled date, school and other recreational programs that are offered within the institution were put on hold until the end of the pandemic, “which who knows when?” Or have begun to be offered through correspondence until future notice.</br></br>
Although the pandemic did not actually hit this yard until the end of 2020, within days of the first positive, the whole yard experienced the most difficult times. Programs were shut down completely. There were no phone calls, yard or recreation time, for almost 3 months. Commission airy and care packages were not passed out. And after they began to run it again, several items have a limit on them due to the pandemic shortage.</br></br>
Also, one of the first positive cases began to appear in the yard. Several buildings were considered quarantine buildings and our building was the main quarantine building. So whatever was housed in this building, it was immediately relocated without even being tested.</br></br>
Although medical staff and other personnel were advised that some of us had some of the symptoms related to the COVID-19 virus. They’re only response was to pack our property and go wherever they were sending us, and once relocated we would follow up the medical process to be tested. Because unfortunately tests were low at the given moment, and the CDCR personnel were instructed to follow their superiors orders.</br></br>
Yeah, most of the CDCR personnel were instructed to relocate us and were very cooperative and up to certain points very helpful as well. But most of them were as confused as we were.</br></br>
Nevertheless, there was only so much they could do themselves. As a result of this, we were Relocated throughout the yard and a massive spread of COVID-19 was ignited throughout the yard and at one time or another every building was placed in quarantine. Also those that were relocated lost their jobs, educational, and self-help group assessments. Along with personal belongings and most importantly communication with their loved ones.</br></br>
This was around the middle of the pandemic. These moments have been some of the worst and most stressful moments of my life since I have been incarcerated. And has also taught me to value life and live every moment as the last minute of my life. Because, I have lost family members and loved ones to this pandemic, that were not supposed to be gone this early. Throughout this chaotic period of time, I have built my resistance and developed some very hopeful coping mechanisms all through constant reading of self-help books, exercise/working out, and keeping a positive mindset.</br></br>
