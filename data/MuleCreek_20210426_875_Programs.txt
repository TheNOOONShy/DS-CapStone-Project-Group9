This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Mule Creek.</br></br>PrisonPandemic, After six and a half years struggling to establish a scientology prison outreach study group at a maximum security facility (circa 2014-2020), the COVID panic put a full stop to all rehabilitation activities early March 2020. Hardly anyone believed COVID believed COVID warranted any alarm and consequently all of us (custody staff and prisoners alike) carried on as usual, and social distancing.</br></br>Of course the education department was closed, as were all the vocational training shops.  The religious department activities were suspended indefinitely, despite the first amendment protections. Enhanced Out Patient (EOP) mental health groups were cancelled from March to October 2020 causing a significant increase in mental health crisis (suicide attempts, staff assaults, etc.).</br></br>All other rehabilitative groups promoting cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) were shut down as well. And all the while the medical department accepted self-admitted opiate addiction claims for a newly introduced Suboxone treatment program. That was what alarmed me most of all in the beginning of 2020 before the COVID panic closed the visiting room-drug route.</br></br>Vides under the guise of rehabilitation, the medical department made Suboxone available to nearly anyone claiming an opiate addiction who wanted treatment without understanding the life-long registration requirement for documented drug addicts after paroling from prison. I remember making a joke about the next thing the medical department will promote will be a needle exchange program.</br></br>By the summer of 2020, there were so many Suboxone patients lining up for their free high that the regular yard schedule would be delayed every morning, hour, and night until the medication line was done.</br></br>With so many new justice reform laws being passed which benefit prisoners, I suspected this new drug treatment was intended to generate greater numbers of patients needed to justify hiring new medical staff as a sort of coup d’état paradigm shift usurping the control of CDCR.</br></br>
