This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Vacaville.

How are you? Fine I hope and when this letter reaches you it finds you in the best of health and spirit. In response to your correspondence dated April 13, 2021. First you should I received your letter practically two weeks after you sent it to me. 

You should also know I am an elderly inmate who was diagnose with the Coronavirus, COVID-19 and was hospitalize for six to seven days at North Bay Hospital in Fairfield, California back in December of 2020. 

Prior to that I had file an appeal that the COVID-19 was a threat to me because of my underlying medical conditions. Like the fact I have been diagnose with multiple myeloma, type two diabetes, sleep apnea, and I have to use a CPAP breathing machine. 

My appeal was denied and it wasn’t long after that I was diagnose with COVID-19.

As to how does this prison is or has handle the COVID-19 pandemic, in my opinion I give this prison a D-minus. Frankly, I haven’t serve time at any prison where I can say the medical attention was adequate. 

Even if the medical attention was satisfactory, it would be a leap of faith. It’s amazing that it’s not worse than it’s been reported to the public and I don’t know if I am qualified to give an opinion on the subject. However I am willing to open up a dialogue through correspondence. 

I believe that your cause is just and I want to support whatever that’s necessary to make sure incarcerated individuals get the best medical care possible. With that said I look forward to your continued correspondence.
