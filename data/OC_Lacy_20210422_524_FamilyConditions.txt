This story was told by a person incarcerated at Theo Lacy.</br></br>

UCI: How would you say- How have you been coping with the crisis of COVID-19?</br></br>

Caller: You know, honestly, it's been a blessing for me in disguise, only because I've done a lot of time in the last couple of years. I’m fighting a drug addiction. You know, obviously, I'm clean right now, but it seems like when I catch time, they always let me out earlier because of COVID. A lot of people are getting out a lot sooner than they expect.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: One time I got out six and a half months early, because of COVID-19 restrictions and regulations, I guess.</br></br>

UCI: Okay, that's good.</br></br>

Caller: But I’ll tell you, I haven’t- I haven’t had any symptoms. I didn't really take it seriously at first. But I saw some people get sick, I saw a couple people die. And so then I took a little more serious, and, um…but yeah, it's definitely affected us in both positive and negative ways, you know. Some people, some people appreciate life a lot more, and some people just try to take advantage of, you know, what's been going on in negative ways as well, so.</br></br>

UCI: Mhm. So, since COVID is everywhere, how has the COVID situation at your facility affected your loved ones?</br></br>

Caller: Affected my- I'm sorry, my what?</br></br>

UCI: Your loved ones?</br></br>

Caller: Oh, I personally don't know anyone close to me that has caught COVID. But we have friends of my family members that have caught it and have passed. So, I mean, y’know, thank the Lord, none of my immediate family members have had any issues, nor I. But yeah, so I haven't been directly affected by it as far as family members. But as far as my environment, yeah, of course I've been affected. But yeah, I haven't experienced that.</br></br>

UCI: Okay. And do you have any, like, recommendations to make the situation better at your facility?</br></br>

Caller: Um, not really. I'm actually pretty impressed with the California Department of Corrections, and the sheriff's department. They’re really taking a lot of precautions. Normally, situations where, I mean, they've really- they've really tried to work with us, you know, to keep us happy while putting us under a bunch of restrictions. I actually don't- I don't have any complaints, honestly, for these people.
