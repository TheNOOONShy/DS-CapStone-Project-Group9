Hello PrisonPandemic,</br></br>

I hope this letter finds you in good health. I don't know you personally but I would like to get to know you if that's okay with you. Hi my name is [redacted], I’m Irish with blond hair, six one and at 225 pounds, with baby blue eyes, with lots of tattoos, age 42. I’ll be 43 in October 2021.</br></br> 

It’s [redacted] night at my cell door watching sake lunches and a cold milk being passed out. Mail comes right behind, mailman gets to my door, a letter slides under my door. I really didn't know what to do. But I would like to thank you, and appreciate you taking your time finding my name on the Orange County Sheriff's Department website and write me.</br></br>

To be honest with you it's difficult for me to write, I don't get mail so please work with me. When I was 18 years I started going to prison in and out. I've been married three times I have five wonderful children. Don't talk to me. Their mom passed away at 36 years old. My mom and dad passed away. Yes, I'm single.</br></br>

I can say I was locked up when this COVID-19 had started. It brought tears to my eyes watching the news every morning watching our loved ones, brother and sister, mom and dad, our friends, are gone because of this COVID-19. It’s sad. My son told dad I'm sick with COVID-19. I didn’t know what, but prayed to god not to take my son out of this world yet.</br></br> 

As I sat here at jail inmates moved around because they caught the COVID-19. Media sucks here; about two and a half months ago, I was tested positive for COVID-19. I was moved to a single cell. I lost my taste buds, my head hurt. Three sack lunches a day we were on locked down, and the three weeks I was single cell, all medical did was come by and check my temp.</br></br>

They did not retest me. Put me right back in [redacted], housing unit. Never asked me if I want the vaccine shot. I don’t get visits, so I worry about that.</br></br>

So far, the last few months I’ve been single cell. Every morning I wake up, jump out of bed, go to my cell door and I yell out “girl I like the way you move,” just to put a smile on my face. But other inmates faces and then make my coffee and clean my cell, and after start reading my book about running a business study.</br></br>

Every day, I have a dream that I have and my dream is to save lives, our loved ones. I get out May 2021, in two weeks working, opening my tow truck working business up.</br></br>

Can you please find a female friend to stay in contact with me to guide me the path I need to go? Like a mentor, someone that can help me with my dreams and goals, like I said, I’ll be out on May 2021. Feel free to hit me up. God bless you and I hope to hear from you soon.
