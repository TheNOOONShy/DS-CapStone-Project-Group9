This story was told by a person incarcerated at Chowchilla.<br></br>

Caller: We have a – we have a new doctor up in here that – who don't – who – I ain't going to say he ain't worth a dime like my friend said over there, but he – he don't really know, you know, exactly what's – what's wrong with us, and he come in taking – taking medications that we need. Like, for instance, this is an example, like I – I got migraine headaches.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>

Caller: So – so I take – I used to take Imitrex. The first thing he do, he got me in and take the Imitrex from me because I piss him off about – about something that I said, you know, because I – because I just tell him how I feel. You know, I tell him, right?</br></br>

So – so when he got pissed at me, he took away one of my breathing treatments, something that I really need, and he took away the Imitrex and gave me some Benadryl. And – and I wrote the chief of staff. I told the chief of staff.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>

Caller: Everybody agreed with him. Whatever he say, whatever he do, there's nothing, you know, they always say, there be no interventions because I used to do 602s, you know, right, and – and it always say there will be no interventions, so whatever he's doing, it's allowed.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, you know? How can you not see a person when they can't breathe for a whole month? And they just coughing and hacking, and you wait for a whole month. And then when you do come in, you tell him if you don't go to the hospital, you're going – you're going to die.</br></br>

Know that I'm afraid of that hospital. Shoot, it was – it was one lady, she – she had a – the COVID, right? They took her out of that room and put me right in that room knowing that I have all these breathing problems. That's scary. So – so ever since then, I just don't go. So – so I just start praying, you know?</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>

Caller: And, so, so that's what I believe kept me alive as long as – as long as I am.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>

Caller: Okay. I just wanted to tell you that, but thank you for listening to me.
