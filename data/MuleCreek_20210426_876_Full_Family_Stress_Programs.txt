Dear PrisonPandemic,</br></br>


Thank you for your kind and heartwarming message. It couldn’t come at a greater time. When I read your message, it almost got me teary-eyed, but since I’m in a place where I can’t show emotion, I had to stop myself. The past few weeks was starting to be difficult for me.</br></br>


I haven’t seen my family since the pandemic started. Although I’m able to talk to them through the phone, it’s still different when having human-face-to-face interaction. When the pandemic started, my county jail didn’t even try to provide some means of communication to see my family, like virtual visits.</br></br>


Back then, I keep hearing rumors that the staff there are trying to get it up and running but they never did. Up until this day, I have not seen my family. I miss them so. Although from what I’ve heard, this prison offers some kind of virtual visits. I really wished I could have known that sooner.</br></br>


They really don’t inform people like me, who are new to the prison system. I had to learn it on my own. That’s why from the past few days, I’ve been feeling alone and sad. I still try my best to go on though. It’s really hard sometimes. Some days, I just wanna stay in bed and stay there. The pandemic hit hard on my mental state, but it varies from different days.</br></br>


I just hope it will get better. Like the one on the commercial on TV, about when everything goes back to normal. It’s easy to think like that out there, but in here, people like me who are incarcerated always have a hard time understanding that. Incarcerated people need to wait a lot of years before that happens.</br></br>


Life here in prison is not much different from out there when the pandemic hit. From what I have noticed, a lot of things are now limited or restricted. Instead of being out of our cell to do the things that we need to do–– like school, work, and stuff, we are now at lockdown.We do get phone calls and showers everyday, but only on a limited time.</br></br>


So for the most part of the day, I try to stay productive in the cell by either exercising or reading a book, and on occasion, watch some television. Of course, I also write letters to my family, but I try not to hinder them as much, since I know they’re busy from work. Also I don’t really need to write them, since I get to talk to them almost everyday on the phone.</br></br>


People over here are hoping that we get the vaccine soon. I've heard some rumors from inmates that some had their vaccine shots already. I’ve also heard that we’re slowly opening scheduled programs next. I hope that’s true. I can’t wait to be able to do something again. So far, no news yet and I’m crossing my fingers for that to happen. Most people feel the same as I do.</br></br>


We try as much as we can to follow CDC guidelines, but it's kinda difficult when we’re in a confined space as big as a school gym with at least 200 inmates. All in all, we’re fairly safe here. I mean, I haven’t heard anyone being severely hurt from the virus. And I hope it will never come to that point. But from what I truly heard is, that there were a lot who was tested positive.</br></br>


I just hope the vaccine will start rolling soon. And that we’ll be able to go to phase 2, like the outside world. Well, that’s about it. Some people here (including me) wished everything goes back to normal. We also hoped that we’ll be able to see our family soon and be with them again. I give my regards to you and your family. I hope they stay clear and more importantly, safe from the virus.</br></br>


Thank you and God bless.
