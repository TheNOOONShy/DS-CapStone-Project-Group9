Hello PrisonPandemic,</br></br>

I hope that you are in good health.</br></br>

Forgive me because I don’t speak English just Spanish.</br></br>

Well here I send you some short lines. Just to greet you. Well moving onto what’s next.</br></br>

Here I am in High Desert State Prison since I was arrested. I am very sad and lonely because I have no communication with my family or with anyone. Nor do I have any support from anyone.</br></br>

I don’t have any money, I don’t have anything. And the truth is I don’t have anyone to talk to, that’s why I feel very sad.</br></br>

And with the COVID-19 pandemic, I tested positive and well I feel worried and anxious.</br></br>

Well I want to know if you can help me. Believe me that I will be very grateful.</br></br>

Well I won’t say goodbye instead talk to you soon.</br></br>

Write me back OK.
