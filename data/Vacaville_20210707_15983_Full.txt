This story was told by a person incarcerated at Vacaville.</br></br>

UCI: How has the COVID situation been at your facility?</br></br>

Caller: I just recently got up here, but the one I just left, it had an outbreak.</br></br>

UCI: Okay. Can you, like, describe that to me? How was that like?</br></br>

Caller: Well, basically, you know, it got to the inmates through staff members because we ain't out there where the outbreak is at. So, the only way us inmates can catch it, is through the staff. And they let us go out to yard, but we - they tell us to do the same thing y'all do out there on the street.</br></br>

Stay six feet apart, wear your masks, and wash your hands. So, dudes will be trying to do that, but everybody don't follow the protocol. So, now we have a situation where, you know, people are being exposed, and people are scared. People don't know what to expect.</br></br>
 
You know, and it's having a toll on our mental because we're already stressed out being in the situation that we're in.</br></br> 

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: Because being locked up, not having our family visits, the letters coming late, stuff like that, you know?</br></br>

UCI: I understand.</br></br> 

Caller: So, it's taking a toll on us, and, you know, a lot of fights have been breaking out behind that. I'm on the SNY unit, and that's basically protective custody.</br></br>

So, fights really don't break out in the units, but a lot of have been breaking them out because this epidemic, you know, it's stressing us out.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: You've got to have cellmates, and if their cellmates ain't following protocol, like washing their hands and stuff, and they're going out to the yard being exposed, wanting to kick it with their friends and stuff, then they want to come back in the cell, not washing their hands and stuff like that. You know, they're exposing you to it.</br></br> 

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: So, it's a whole lot that go into it. And, I mean, like, I wrote y'all two letters. Hasn't nobody wrote back, though.</br></br>

UCI: I see.</br></br>

Caller: I don't know if y'all respond to letters or not.</br></br>

UCI: I'll reach out to our letter-writing team. What facility were you housed at? 'Cause I - since I can't tell you a name. You said Vacaville, right? Vacaville?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, Vacaville.</br></br>

UCI: All right. I'll reach out to our letter-writing team and see if they've received it just in case that way. But, just so you know, the more direct line is - the hotline - where we could have like a one-on-one conversation with you because, as you can see, a lot of people think we're-</br></br>

Caller: Yes, I would rather do this anyway.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, well, a lot of people-</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, [unintelligible].</br></br>

UCI: Sorry, continue.</br></br>

Caller: Like, y'all got things here saying, you know, like, artwork and stuff like that. And what I put in my letter, I said, can y'all give me a task? I ain't got nothing to do. I was in college.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah.</br></br> 

Caller: I was in college taking them college courses when I was on the yard. So, you know, that kept me occupied. And plus, I'll go home soon.</br></br> 

So, but, I've been down 18 years, and it's like I've never seen anything. It was scary in the prison at first, though, you know?</br></br>

UCI: Yeah. Sorry. Where were you during, like, this whole, like, time? Did you ever switch? And if you didn't, like, switch facilities, I was wondering, like, what was the vaccination situation like at your facility?</br></br>

Caller: Oh, they did do the vaccination thing, the vaccine shot, and I took mine.</br></br>

UCI: Good for you.</br></br>

Caller: There's a lot of people who denied. There's a lot of people who didn't take the shot. So, I don't know. But they did do it.</br></br>

They got - everybody got a chance to get it, but there's a lot of people who didn't take it.</br></br>

UCI: So, it was up to the person's discretion if they would like to take it or not.</br></br>

Caller: Exactly. Exactly.</br></br>

UCI: Understood. You said that it was a very trying time on your mental health. How are you coping with the crisis?</br></br>

Caller: Well, I recently lost my mom, and, you know, I'm, like, taking college courses and getting ready to parole soon. I've got a lot on my mind. I've been trying not to think about that too much, but it's right there in your face, you know?</br></br> 

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: So, it's hard to get around it because it's reality. It's right there in your face, and it's like I really want to focus on getting paroled, and getting my life back together, and doing things like that, and getting my life, starting my life all over again, because in here, this is not living.</br></br> 

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: Basically, you're just a living soul, but you're not living. So, it's like I'm trying to get back out to the streets and focus on how I'm getting on parole, get my record expunged, and, you know, finish going to college, and getting my education, and, you know, getting a career and stuff like that. So, it's like I'm trying not to think about this epidemic, but, I mean, it's like in your face, man.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: I don't know how I've been coping.</br></br> 

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: I really don't.</br></br>

UCI: It seems like you've just been keeping yourself busy to cope. I'm so sorry. I'm sorry for your-</br></br>

Caller: Exactly, yeah.</br></br>

UCI: I'm so sorry for your loss. Like, from the deepest part of my heart, you have my condolences. I'm so very sorry because you said you lost your mom, right?</br></br>

I'm so sorry from the deepest part of my heart.</br></br>

Caller: Thank you.</br></br>

UCI: You said - you said how, like-</br></br>

Caller: Who is [redacted]?</br></br>

UCI: Huh?</br></br>

Caller: Who is [redacted]?</br></br>

UCI: I didn't - I don't know. I said from the deepest part of my heart, you have my condolences.</br></br>

Caller: The one who wrote me.</br></br>

UCI: Oh, okay. So she was-</br></br>

Caller: Oh, no, that's who wrote.</br></br>

UCI: The person who wrote you, they're part of our letter-writing team. They write out to people who are housed at these facilities to try and get you to call us, so we can hear your story, or write a letter back, so we can hear your story.</br></br>

Caller: Okay, I got one question. I got one more question to ask you, and then I'll let you do what you do. If you finish, like, if you need to ask me questions and stuff.</br></br>

Can you all give me a task to do? Right now, I'm suspended from school because I got a write up.</br></br>

UCI: Let me ask.</br></br>

Caller: I ain't busy. I ain't occupied doing nothing. I need a task I can probably do in here to help out with the situation. I'll be willing to do that.</br></br>

UCI: Let me ask my supervisor, yeah, real quick.</br></br>

Caller: You know my name, right?</br></br>

UCI: No, I do not but please do not provide it. Because we're not supposed to have your name. I'm going to ask them for a thing, and I'm going to ask them what basically you could do from here. I'm going to tell you what I think you can do.</br></br> 

I'm going to wait for my supervisor to tell me what to advise, but one thing you can do is, this hotline is always open. Not always open, sorry, is open five days a week from five to nice. It's not always me on the line, but we're five to nine.</br></br>

But what you can do is, you can tell people who you know have had their COVID stories, you can spread - you can tell them, "Hey, share our number to tell them," like, "Hey, this hotline story, we can - this hotline will listen to your COVID story. They're trying to put it on their website repository."</br></br>

That way, they can tell their story and, like, that type of stuff, but if they don't want to, like, personally call because I'm not sure how the calling situation is, what you can do, is you can gather their stories and then call us again to share your fellow people's stories about how they were dealing with COVID and stuff.</br></br>

Caller: What about - what about employees, too, like, staff?</br></br>

UCI: Oh, like, employees of the facility?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, they can call, too, regarding their COVID stories.</br></br>

Caller: They'll just tell me their story, and I'll write it all down and send it to y'all.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, that's great, too. Yeah, that's beautiful. Yeah, that's also - that's also-</br></br>

Caller: That's what I'm going to do then.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, you can write down their stories about the-</br></br>

Caller: I'm going to get everybody's story in here. I'm going to get everybody's story in here. Is it cool if I give ya'll - give them the number, too?</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, give them the number. We would love to hear their story.</br></br>

Caller: Okay, that's cool then. That's what I want to do then. Thank you for giving me a chance to, you know, be part of something that's positive and, you know, part of, like, the reform, like you said, and just do something constructive and help out in a way because I'm trying to give back and show people that I'm not a bad person.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: I already got a bad image by being incarcerated.</br></br> 

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: People don't trust me. And, like, I'm in here for a crime I didn't do, and I haven't had no write ups except for recently, and I parole in next month, to tell you the truth.</br></br>

And I've been down 18 years. I ain't never had a fight or anything like that. I'm real peaceful.</br></br> 

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: I'm going to try my best to help out and do that because I want to help.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, I just want to help out, man. I mean, I like what you guys are doing. You know, I think, I appreciate the fact that y'all are thinking about us, you know, because everybody else is acting like, you know, they don't really care about us.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, of course. Do you have anything else you want to share?</br></br>

Caller: That's what I said in my letter. That's how I wrote my letter. It's kind of scary and depressing, and I don't know about my family. My family haven't wrote me, so I don't know how to contact people on the outside or help anyone out there.</br></br>
 
I'm just going to stick to the facility and maybe somebody else can come up with some ideas. I'm going to just try to get some people involved in here, this little role, and see what I can do by sharing y'all program, y'all project, to them. And if they want to help out, you know. I'm going to give them the number, the address, and let them go from there.</br></br>

UCI: That's fantastic. Thank you so much. The more voices, the better. The more stories, the better.</br></br>

Caller: Okay, thank you.</br></br>

UCI: Is there anything else you want to share about - sorry. Continue.</br></br>

Caller: I don't really think there's too much, just the fact that I'm going to be going back down south, too. I never heard of UC Irvine.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, it's a college in Irvine. It's a very nice school. I'm happy to be going there. I'm a student there right now.</br></br>

Caller: Okay, yeah, because right now, I'm in college. I just got 100 percent on my final exam.</br></br>

UCI: Good for you.</br></br>

Caller: I'm going to a college called [redacted]. Yeah, I'm going to a college called [redacted]. I just got 100 percent.</br></br>

I didn't know I - I got 60 seconds remaining. So, I'm probably going to have to go right now.</br></br> 

UCI: Okay.</br></br>

Caller: But it was nice talking to you.</br></br>

UCI: It was nice talking to you, too. Thank you for calling us.</br></br>

Caller: What'd you say your name was, again? It's [redacted]?</br></br>

UCI: Yes.</br></br>

Caller: Your name was [redacted], right?</br></br>

UCI: Yes, that is my name.</br></br>

Caller: Thanks, [redacted]. I got to go now.</br></br>

UCI: All right. Thank you so much for calling.</br></br>

Caller: All right, thanks.</br></br>

UCI: I know you said you're going to spread the word. That means a lot to us. The more voices, the better. Thank you for telling your story.</br></br>

Caller: All right. Thank you.</br></br>

UCI: All right. Bye-bye.</br></br>

Caller: Bye-bye.
