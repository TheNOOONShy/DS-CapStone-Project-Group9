This story was told by a person incarcerated at Donovan.</br></br>UCI: Another question: What has it been like for you to have reduced visitations and programming?</br></br>

Caller: Well, the programming is worse because we need that program. You know. All these little self-help groups, they're the best. Those are the things we need to get back out there and not come back.

I wish I had known these things that I have learned during this prison time before. I would have never come to prison. You know.</br></br>

But I really didn't have the coping skills that I needed to survive out there. There was a lot of things that happened along the way I didn't know how to cope with, and I made the wrong choices and wound up paying the price for it. So, here I am. But I would have never made those choices.</br></br> 

You know. I wouldn't have blamed anybody else and accepted responsibility for the stupid things I did. You know.</br></br>

It would have been a completely different– I would have had different behavior because I'd have had a completely different character. I'm a completely different person now of who I am than I was then, and it's all because of the self-help groups and the things that I have learned.</br></br>

And I've almost got my degree so I'm quite proud of a few of my accomplishments.</br></br>

UCI: Would you say that that's kind of a coping mechanism you've been using throughout this whole pandemic during COVID?</br></br>

Caller: Yes, and- you know having emotional regulation skills and social skills and a lot of the things that I've learned in here have really helped me. You know, because- you know so many people have different views, and a lot of people spit venom a lot.</br></br>

We're in prison. A lot of people haven't learned how to act yet. So, it's how you respond to criticism and respond to any other ignorance in the world around here that really matters. And once you learn how to respond to these things, you become a better person inside and you teach others those same skills.</br></br>

And I've found kind've like a whole different purpose in life.
