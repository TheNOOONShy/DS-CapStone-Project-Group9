This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Norco.</br></br>
This dorm was being used for months to isolate the infected inmates but had been closed for a few weeks due to the cases dropping. Once there, it was dirty and cold. During my time there, there would be no heat and correction officers would leave the door open at 10:00 and 5:30 during shift change, with the wind blasting us in first row of bunks!</br></br>

One of us would had to get up and close the door. Almost forgot, had to take a lot of cold showers. It seems symptoms worsen. No laundry exchange. Twice a day nurses came and checked our vitals and would make sure we got cough drops or aspirin.</br></br> 

Eventually, I was happy to be away from the building of sickness. Once we got to the new dorm, a correction officer that was working in the COVID positive dorm was doing overtime there. Next day he tested positive and the weeks following it has hit this everyday. People are being taken out and the saga continues.
