This story was told by a person incarcerated at Pelican Bay.</br></br>

Caller: The vaccination, it's been actually good right here. We got vaccinated. And ever since we got vaccinated, once a week, we get tested. You know?</br></br>

And then, anybody that does – that has contracted or tested negative, they have been moved off the yard, quarantined in a different part of the prison. You know?</br></br>

UCI: Mhmm.</br></br>

Caller: So, as far as like vaccines and all that, everything – that went cool. You know? And anybody that they want to get vaccinated and they kind of like separated them from the vaccinated.</br></br>

And anybody that tested positive, pretty much, they've had got it from, maybe, a correctional officer that they were around. And then, once they tested positive, then, they were moved away from everybody else, you know, into like a quarantine area for 14 days. And then, after they no longer test positive, then, they would return back to the housing.
