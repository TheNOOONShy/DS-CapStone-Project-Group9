My safety concerns were toward the beginning C.Os were allowed to work overtime and swap shifts with C.Os on other yards. This was during  time when inmates were ordered to wear masks at all times. C.os were also reluctant to wear masks and even refused. It took several complaints from inmates before staff was ordered to wear them.</br></br>

This showed a lack of awareness and misguided rebelliousness on the part of staff. I found it frustrating how often inmates had to complain to higher ranking staff before all staff comply. As with most issues between staff and inmates, it is ten percent of the people creating 90 percent of the problems. Meaning, the majority of staff had no problem wearing masks and maintaining social distancing.</br></br>

On a personal level, a year without visits has greatly impacted me. I have had to remain at this prison because it is close to my parents, and mother had medical problems. During the year without visits, my parents had to move to Washington so my brother could help them. It was very difficult for my mother.</br></br>

There is a very real possibility I will never see them again as they are in their 70â€™s and in poor health. Throughout this time, I have remained positive. The outside organizations who volunteer here (redacted), send in assignments for those enrolled in their classes, which has helped many people here. The recreational therapists who work for the mental health department consistently go door to door offering self-help packages, puzzles, and games, and making sure the population is ok.</br></br>

Overall, the real way to measure if this institution performed well during this pandemic is whether or not the wives of inmates were threatened. For that, I would say it has been a success, we have been blessed with very low positive tests. And very few deaths my complaints are about the general lack of awareness, and the carrying out of policy at the lower levels. But these are systemic issues that arise on any occasion.
