So then by 8:00 am we are served breakfast which consist of eggs, beans, oatmeal, flour tortilla shell, one banana, and one milk on a plastic tray. You get 10 minutes to eat it and put the tray outside of your door. Then the nurses come to check your temperature to see if you have a fever or COVID-19 symptoms. In the process you get your lunch with your breakfast.</br></br> 

Which consist of two pieces of bread, two pieces of bologna, pretzels, four little cheese crackers and a little pack of sugar-free Kool-Aid. That is it until 8:00 pm tonight for dinner, which consist of more beans and rice, cornbread, a salad with just lettuce, no dressing, a piece of cake, no icing, and a little pack of Kool-Aid. A tray you would make for a little kid, serious.</br></br> 

They are getting $80,000 a year for us to feed us like this. You can have a TV in your cell if you buy for $200 a 15 inch and a radio. And you have to make a place for it to hang off of your bunk with shoe strings or sheets. You get clean clothes once a week, shower twice a week every three days.</br></br> 

Today they let us outside for one hour and then back in your cell. It is very crazy in here we go out every two weeks for an hour.</br></br>

You have to be mentally strong or you snap. A lot of people have committed suicide, I love myself too much for that. That is why I pray for everyone. We will get through this together.
