This story was told by a person incarcerated at Chino.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, for surely it has. My wife has been trying to visit me for the whole time I've been up here and she can't even get through when she calls Chino. If you go and call Chino, you could try tomorrow or the day after that, because they probably won't answer right now, but they never answer.</br></br> 

My girl called back to back and, like, every department and they never answered. It's like, it's nearly impossible to get a visit. And saying that's for me, like I'm all the way down here in LA and my wife, we live in Stockton all the way up north, so, like you can’t just drive down here and like, see, what's like, you know?</br></br>
 
UCI: Mm-hmm. Yeah, I know where Stockton's at. That's cool though. And so, yeah, you said that it's hard for them to answer the call. So, I'm guessing other people that you know haven't really gotten to visit or haven't really gotten visitations either, right?</br></br>
 
Caller: Oh, nobody in this dorm, ain't nobody in this dorm got a visit.</br></br>
 
UCI: Damn. I am sorry to hear that man. What about, so, how have you been coping with the crisis?</br></br>  
 
Caller: With the what?</br></br>
 
UCI: With the, with the crisis, like everything that's going on in your facility, how have you been coping with it? Like to keep your, to keep your mind busy.</br></br>
 
Caller: What’s the stuff that I could do?</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>
 
Caller: It's like basically work out, you know, and just get on this phone, call my wife, talk to my daughter and stuff, but it's like watching TV, stuff like that.
