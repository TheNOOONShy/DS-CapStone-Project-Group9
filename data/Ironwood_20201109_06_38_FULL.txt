This story was told by a person incarcerated at Ironwood.</br></br>

UCI: What facility are you currently housed at?</br></br>Caller: Ironwood State Prison.</br></br>UCI: What is the COVID-19 situation like at your facility?</br></br>Caller: Um, it’s pretty bad, at least where, can I say where I work?</br></br>UCI: Yes sir, we’re not going to say any names.</br></br>Caller: Okay because I’m a health care facility maintenance guy and they’re running out of chemicals, they’re running out of soaps, they’re running out of everything they’re saying that they’re giving us, they’re not.</br></br> 

I actually work in PIA that’s supposed to be distributing the chemicals and they don’t even have [unintelligible] use alternate chemicals just to do some of the cleaning. But as of today we ran out of cell block 64. We’re using the substitute of saniguard, dilute it, and most of the cleaning they do here is diluted [unintelligible]. Hello?</br></br>UCI: I’m here, I’m listening.</br></br>Caller: Okay, other important things, well they started feeding us, as of yesterday they started feeding us in the buildings. On June 11th, on June 10th, I work at central health, I was confirmed as a positive, um prisoner that came up positive of COVID virus.</br></br> 

I went to, um first they placed, prior to that they moved us to the visiting, family visiting bungalows and from there they snatched me up about two o’clock in the morning and sent me to the hospital that was central health and I was held there with just basically solitary confinement for approximately 18 days.</br></br> 

From there they moved me to ad seg for another 18 days and then, all this time it was in solitary confinement basically. I was in ad seg as if, being treated as if I was an ad seg inmate that did something wrong which the only thing was wrong was that I caught COVID virus.</br></br> Because one of the staff members, I was cleaning their office and they had contracted the COVID virus and they didn’t notify us until about a week later. Then they told us not to clean the room but by then I was already infected. Went through all the phases, I still have headaches as of today since June 10th, oh well since June 8th, 8th, is kind of, kinda when they traced it to June 8th. But they didn’t, they didn’t isolate me until about June 11th.</br></br>Prior, and then, again, trying to get the dates right. October 18th, everybody that worked at central health or everybody that worked for PIA, they isolated again, the whole 16 of us. Isolated us and then housed us in C yard, building 1 I wanna say for approximately 14 days.</br></br> 

None of us came out positive but again, solitary confinement. Basically treating us as if we had did something wrong. From that they moved us back, they moved us from C yard which is a general population to B yard for another 14 days. From there they just, after the 14 days there, they moved us back to A yard. So actually I’ve been at every facility except family visiting, I was housed in every yard.</br></br> Apart from that I still have headaches, and another thing it’s kinda like I wrote up a 602 based on me catching COVID, COVID-19, was denied and the denial basically said, their denial to my 602 appeal was it was unknown how the inmate contracted COVID virus.</br></br> 

Denying, and my argument was “I’m in your custody, you were lacking in providing us protective PPE, personal protective equipment [unintelligible] headache in the morning. Right now my 602’s been in Sacramento since, I don’t know, a month and a half now.</br></br> 

They denied it right away, every request for them to, you know, correct the errors just didn’t, basically just tossed around, being ignored like we did something wrong. Well at least that’s the impression I got.</br></br>And it’s right now it’s like a, what’s going on is the officers are getting I guess frustrated with all the safety precautions they have to take because you know, tryna prevent the spreading, but you know their frustration’s being you know, you know put on us, the inmate population. I guess uh, that’s pretty much my story and my experience.</br></br>UCI: Okay, well can you remember, can you try to think back to the beginning of the virus and maybe give me a month by month breakdown, if you can remember about how it’s been handled or what happened? Starting maybe from March?</br></br>Caller: [unintelligible] and the treatment that we’re getting in regards to you know, like I said right now a lot of the officers are just getting frustrated and they’re sharing that frustration with the inmates which is kind of weird. They’ve been, they never stopped searching, you know, like patting us down. Like I go to work and everyday they pat us down without changing their gloves out.</br></br> This is [unintelligible], when you used to go to chow, you would go up to chow and on the way out they would randomly select inmates, pat them down and never change their gloves and pat down the next inmate, pat them down and so on and so on. When I go to work every day they search us, search our clothes, which they got a metal detector and they got screening machines but even on top of that they strip us down to naked, go through our clothes and give it back to us.</br></br> 

And they’re just doing this without even changing their gloves, disregarding the social distancing protocols. You know, of course you have some that try to follow it and some that they just don’t care, they’re just frustrated with the restrictions.</br></br>UCI: Do the guards wear masks?</br></br>Caller: Excuse me?</br></br>UCI: Do the guards wear masks?</br></br>Caller: Yeah, right now this whole week they’ve been enforcing it. But, um, for whatever reason I think there’s gonna be an audit so all of them are putting on, they’re getting on their Ps and Qs. But you know, a good majority, I think the other day they came by and I think squad or the investigating unit was taking pictures of officers not with their mask on or, somebody was with them that was taking pictures.</br></br> 

And you know, like I said, the frustration’s just being put on us. One of the frustration I see it is the mask, they’re not wearing the proper mask. They’re just wearing like the sleeve of a shirt, which it looks like to me.</br></br> 

The mask that they’re issue they’re- I haven’t, there’s like the majority of them are just wearing their own, you know personal whatever they like bandanas and stuff like that.</br></br>UCI: What have you been doing to cope?</br></br>Caller: What was that?</br></br>UCI: What have you been doing to cope with the crisis? Or how have you been coping with the crisis?</br></br>Caller: Me, I’ve just been working, you know I’m on a critical list so I work pretty much seven days a week which is keeping me [unintelligible].</br></br>UCI: You were sorry?</br></br>Caller: Excuse me?</br></br>UCI: I didn’t catch the last thing you said, you were what?</br></br>Caller: I didn’t understand that last part.</br></br>UCI: Oh, it’s okay, I just said I couldn’t, I didn’t hear the last thing you said. </br></br>
Caller: Oh I was [unintelligible]. I’m in building one and there is no hot water [unintelligible] four days without any hot water in the building so we’re showering in cold water and we’re, I mean injury to insult, I mean insult to injury the buildings are falling apart.</br></br> 

In 602, cause you try to get them to do it and they say “well you got to talk to operations”. Did you get that?</br></br>UCI: Yes sir. Okay so we have about a minute left. Is there anything, what else would you like for people to know about your experience?</br></br>Caller: At the top of my head, I wish they would just have chemicals, the chemicals they’re not for COVID virus. And when they do get the proper chemicals they’re diluting it way out of ratio, might as well put water on the ground. [unintelligible].</br></br>UCI: Okay, please so we are almost out of time, I want to encourage you please if you have friends please encourage them to call. We would love if you called back too if you can.</br></br>Caller: Yeah I got the notice and I [unintelligible].</br></br>UCI: Oh thank you so much. Thank you we also have a P.O. Box.
