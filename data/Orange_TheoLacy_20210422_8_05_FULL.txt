<em>This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Orange County Theo Lacy Jail.</br></br></em>

UCI: I am listening, if you want to tell me your story.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, basically, my story from in here, during this pandemic, I mean. I guess, like at first I was kinda scared for my parents, being locked up, but overall, you know what I mean, I, you know what I mean, I guess things as it progressed, I mean, I was starting to get even more scared because my parents had caught coronavirus and I thought they were going to, they were going to die on me.</br></br> 

And I was in here, you know what I mean and I couldn’t get out, you know what I mean and that was a problem for me. And I was going through a lot at the time. But overall, they got better, thank God. And that was one of the struggles I went through in here.</br></br>

And another thing was during this pandemic, they have also, been feeding us all sack lunches, which is baloney meat and two sandwiches with baloney meat, and a pack of cookies and a fruit, three times a day. We don’t get no hot meals anymore. That’s been going on for a year in Orange County, in the Orange County jail.</br></br>

And also, I had gotten the vaccine, prior- I think on March 30th, and I just last, a couple days ago, have recovered from it. It gave me- I got the Johnson & Johnson vaccine; it gave me mad headaches, and  basically, you know what I mean. I was really going through it, especially the first night that I got the vaccine, I really went through it.</br></br>

And, that’s basically it. And if you guys have any questions for me, you know what I mean?</br></br>

UCI: So what was, or what had the vaccination situation been like at your facility? Are they trying to get everyone to have it? Are they giving you the option?</br></br>

Caller: They’re giving us options.</br></br>

UCI: Oh, that’s good.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, yeah.  Any other questions?</br></br>

UCI: You mentioned, like you were nervous about the situation with your parents.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah.</br></br>

UCI: What was, the visitation stuff like? I’m guessing you weren’t able to see them or talk to them.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, yeah. There was no visits at all. Only, I was only able to see them, I mean, able to talk to them over the phone, and that’s how I was getting updates from how they were doing while they were sick.</br></br>

UCI: Wow.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah.</br></br>

UCI: So what is the COVID situation like currently, since people are getting vaccinated?</br></br>

Caller: It’s still the same, honestly. They, just last month, I think on the 15th, March 15th, they had opened up visits for once a month, but I guess this month, they’re opening up visits. You can have a 30 minute visit twice a month, for 30 minutes only twice a month, but, you know what I mean? But that’s as far as visits go.</br></br>

UCI: Oh.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah.</br></br>

UCI: So has- what have you been able to do to make the situation better with all of the rules and stuff that have been in place?</br></br>

Caller: Honestly, like, not much. But, I’ve been coping with it, you know what I mean? By, you know what I mean, working out, reading a book, you know what I mean? Just, know what I mean? Or, getting phone time, calling my people, my loved ones out there, and seeing how they’re doing. And that’s basically how I’ve been coping with my situation.</br></br>

But most people in here don’t really have that, you know what I mean? Some people in here honestly don’t have no one to talk to and like those are the people honestly I feel for them ‘cause, you know what I mean, they’re the ones that are honestly going through it. And, you know what I mean, especially ‘cause this situation, this pandemic.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, I totally get that. What was the- when the pandemic first started, what was the facility you’re at doing to keep everyone safe and healthy?</br></br>

Caller: What was the facility doing to keep everyone safe and healthy?</br></br>

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: Well, okay, when the pandemic started, I was currently in prison. I was at North Kern State prison, and at first, when the pandemic started, they had, we had no contact with the other buildings. There’s two buildings on the yard, so there were like,  probably like 200-man buildings, that each building would hold.</br></br> 

So there was no contact with the other building, we would each take turns going to the yard, and being able to get fresh air.</br></br>

And at first they weren’t regulating on mask-wearing, but then they started regulating on mask-wearing. We were to have our- we had to have our masks on when we left our bunk, but as long as we were, near where we live, we didn’t have to have our mask. And, you know what I mean, that’s pretty much, you know what I mean, what happened.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, that makes sense.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, and any other questions?</br></br>

UCI: So you said you were coping with this, you were going to the gym and working out, so, the gym, were they-</br></br>

Caller: Well there’s, honestly, there is no gym, we have no gym. But like, just doing push-ups, burpees, or like stuff like that, know what I mean, in my cell. ‘Cause right now I’m currently, we’re in-it’s like a pod. It’s a 16-man pod, no, there’s 16 cells, two people in each cell, and and we only get three hours of dayroom.</br></br> 

And the rest we spend inside our cells, with, it’s me and my other cellmate.</br></br>

UCI: Oh, okay.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah.</br></br>

UCI: And, so what do you think would’ve made the situation, like, at your facility better? Either with family, like visitation or calls, or cleaning, any of that.</br></br>

Caller: Honestly overall, I think they’ve been handling it good but  but honestly if things were better, you know what I mean, or if I could add something there, you know what I mean I wish there was more visitation. ‘Cause there was no visitation for a whole year for these guys in Orange County jail. And for a whole year there was no visitation, and that really, you know what I mean?</br></br> 

Kinda roughed up a couple guys in here, know what I mean, they were kinda getting sad and depressed, and, getting in their depression mode, and you know what I mean. So I kinda felt bad for those guys, but yeah.</br></br>

UCI: So now that they’re allowing visitation, are there certain rules in place for that?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, there’s like, you know what I mean, you gotta make an appointment, you gotta check in, if you’re late for your appointment, even like two minutes late, you know what I mean, it’s a wrap. You can’t go up to your visit, you know what I mean and it’s only a 30 minute visit, and that’s it. It’s only like two visits per month, for right now.</br></br>

UCI: Wow.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah.</br></br>

UCI: Is there anything else that you wanted to tell me, or anything that comes to mind?</br></br>

Caller: No not really, I think we hit-I think that’s it.</br></br>

UCI: Okay, well, thank you so much for participating in the PrisonPandemic project. And you can always send us a letter if you have more to say, or you can call back.</br></br>

Caller: Okay, yeah, ‘cause I think I sent you guys a letter, and I mentioned my name on there, is that gonna affect anything?</br></br>

UCI: No, it’s okay, we have a team of people that go through to edit and make sure that there’s no names in the letters or in the calls.</br></br>

Caller: Okay. Is it still recording right now, or no?</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, it’s still recording.</br></br>

Caller: Oh, okay, I got you. Alright, but yeah, that’s pretty much it, you know what I mean? But like so what website do my, do I go to, or does someone go to or-</br></br>

UCI: Let me get the website name.</br></br>

UCI: I’ll get the website for you right now.</br></br>
