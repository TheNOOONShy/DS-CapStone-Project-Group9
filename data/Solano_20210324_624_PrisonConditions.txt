This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Solano.</br></br>

So about this COVID deal. So I came to prison in 2019 after being in jail fighting my case since 2016. I went to Trace which is a DVI, a real shit hole.</br></br>

From there I was sent to Wasco State Prison, a very hot place. I was only there for a few months when this COVID deal picked up. It was quick.</br></br>

They started to put us on full lockdown which was crazy since the only way to get COVID was from a CO or free staff. It wasn’t like we would bring it back. They started to make all the inmates wear cloth masks, but the CO’s didn’t have to wear them. Crazy huh?</br></br>

They would have the inmates clean the tables with the same old rags. But we lost all our time out of our cells. Yes that prison was cell living, which means we lived in a closet with a toilet.</br></br>

And if we got to use the phone it was for 15 minutes a day or when we got it. Meanwhile visits and yard were cancelled right away. Time went by and it was mostly the same.</br></br>

Then the prison system said people could move to other prisons. I was to be transferred back in April but that was stopped due to COVID. I’m from Northern California and Wasco was a long way from my family.</br></br>

Plus with no visits I wanted to be moved closer to home. So November 3rd I got moved to California State Prison - Solano, second yard. But when I got here I was sent to a cell alone to quarantine with only 15 minutes out of my cell to shower or use the phone.</br></br>

I was there for a month in building seven on the three yard. Then I got moved to the two yard building one E which was a dorm. OK this was something different but I could use the phone more to at least talk to loved ones so they could know I was OK. </br></br>

Then we hear people are getting sick but my building was OK. Everything was on some kind of lockdown limited movement from what the other inmate would say. But I didn’t know since I came from a different prison, so it was a normal thing to me not knowing better.</br></br>

So right before Christmas everything stopped. I couldn’t get my canteen which is prison store. It’s kind of a big deal when we don’t have much as it is.</br></br>

OK then on New Years people in our building started to test positive. They would pack them all up and move them all out. To a different place.</br></br>

And on January 2nd, a day before my birthday I got moved to building 9 on the 3 yard for quarantine in a cell by myself. I never tested positive.</br></br>

But I believe I had to of gotten it, shit, the whole prison got it. But I stayed in quarantine for a full month. But then one day they tell me to pack up, I was going out.</br></br>

I got sent to building 16 on the two yard a dorm. I got all set up and not even four hours there they call my name and tell me and a few other inmates to pack up and to go to quarantine.</br></br>

So this time got sent to building seven on the three yard. Remind you every time I’m in quarantine I only get 15 mins out to shower or phone call. And I have a medical condition from the military that requires me to shower more than once but they didn’t care.</br></br>

I filed complaints but they didn’t care. So I’m there for another month. Then they tell us we are all moving to building nine. What a fuck around. </br></br>

In there for a few days when I’m finally moved to building 17, a dorm in the second yard. And here is where I am now. Still no visit so I haven’t seen my kids since 2019.</br></br>

My youngest don’t even really remember me. Still there is no end in sight. They say people are testing positive in other buildings but it's the same fuck the inmate mentality. My family can’t get approved to visit me if they wanted to.</br></br>

I don’t know what else is to come. It’s been over a year and prison is only worsened. They have offered us the vaccine but I don’t trust this place.
