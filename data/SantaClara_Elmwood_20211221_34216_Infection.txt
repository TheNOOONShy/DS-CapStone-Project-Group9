This story was told by a person incarcerated at Elmwood Correctional Facility.</br></br>

Caller: But I recently received two shots already which was the - I don’t know what they are called but they gave me two shots and I been doing all right. I never got the COVID or anything like that.</br></br>

UCI: And what has the vaccine process been like at your facility?</br></br>

Caller: It’s been alright a little painful, but nothing too shabby about it.</br></br>

UCI: Have you seen a lot of people getting vaccinated?</br></br>

Caller: Not that I have seen, but yeah they send you like a paper if you want to take the shot. And if not then you don’t have to, it's not mandatory but they recommended it. So it's like - it's just if you want to take, if not well then it’s up to you.</br></br>

UCI: Have you seen any staff members get vaccinated?</br></br>

Caller: No I don’t think - I don't think they'll show you that. There's this one lady that gave me the shot said she had the shot before, so don’t be scared to take it. So, you know, it made me feel good, so I took the other shot.</br></br>

UCI: Do you you all have access to information about the shots if you wanted to know more about it?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah we do, they give you a pamphlet that tells you what the shot is and what the, you know, symptoms of it, reactions to it, and you read it, and basically, it’s just whatever they give people out there too in the clinic. But they offer it free here too as well as outside. So I don’t think it should be harmful.</br></br>

UCI: Are they offering the booster?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah that's the one I just - I barely took that one, like a week ago, and that one was a pretty tough one ‘cause I got a fever and all that. But it already went away, so if that was a side effect of it that's the only thing I got out of that.
