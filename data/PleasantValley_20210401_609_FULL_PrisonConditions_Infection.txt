Dear PrisonPandemic project</br></br>

Well it’s nice to hear from you! As you can see I just received your letter post marked February. Most cause of fear of what we may have to say! I think that us inmates were the last of their worries. As COVID hit our yard the made D yard quarantine.</br></br> 

And I was actually one of the first few to get moved but it turned out I had valley fever really bad!</br></br>

But those cells never got cleaned out when someone that was positive moved out and put inmates that were maybe, big maybe, exposed right into their cell. And guess what, now those inmates just got the virus! The prison moved used all over the prison from blocks to blocks and we all questioned why!</br></br>

The most logical move was just to leave us in our cells there was no movement. But the spike sky rocketed with positive test after they moved us forceable whether we want to or not! And it was just so that we can get the virus! We would get into big trouble if we don’t use the mask.</br></br> 

But the CO’s never wore their mask and always were in groups. Always welcomed each other with big hugs and fist hand shakes!</br></br>

And I actually filed a 602, basically calling why are we being punished for the negligent and poor COVID-19 protocols. And not being able to call our families and it’s really stressful cause at the end of the day we don’t matter! And today we are on COVID restriction again.</br></br> 

Right when we were going to move up a phase!</br></br>

Those inmates just received their first dose of vaccine but it seems a little funny. But one way or another we still are in fear! Well I hope this could be of some help and I look forward to hearing from you soon.</br></br>

Respectfully.
