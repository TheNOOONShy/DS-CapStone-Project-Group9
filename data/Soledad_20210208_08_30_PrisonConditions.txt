This story was told by a person incarcerated at Soledad.</br></br>Caller: It’s just a lot of bad management. Some things are real simple. They test you three or four times a week. You ask for the results, you can’t even get them.</br></br>Then when you beg maybe five months down the road, they may give you some results. They temperature check you. When they temperature check you, you ask them questions, they tell you they can’t even answer any questions.</br></br>For the most part, people are surviving in here. But there’s guys kicking on the doors all night because they can’t either get canteen, or their showers, or something they need. These guys think it’s a joke. This is a serious situation here.</br></br>And I think the Senate oversight committee and also the assembly oversight committee needs to come down and personally inspect this place, unannounced, and see what they’re actually doing here. They put people out in tents that were infected, the wind blew, and the tents almost lifted off the ground. The porta-potties they had, they all fell over.</br></br>These guys are put on a yard, on a field, and they’re COVID positive. It’s like they don’t even care how they do these guys in here. This is not humanism. So it’s crazy.</br></br>I mean I know Gavin Newsom is a positive guy, but this lady Kathleen Allison, man, if she’s managing the prison system, we were way better with Ralph Diaz. At least he would be down here trying to do something- or send a strike team down here. We need a strike team at Soledad and at Salinas Valley.
