This story was told by a person incarcerated at San Quentin.</br></br>

Caller: So COVID at San Quentin started from nothing. And because of a bumbling judge, turned into the worst prison disaster, they're calling it that. Population I think was like 4,000 at San Quentin.</br></br>

They dropped it down to around 33 hundred with from March until like, about when I was paroling there, and within I think 10 days of my parole from there, there was almost two and a half thousand cases confirmed out of 33-34 hundred inmates- what the hell? So in a timeline, March 18, they said, okay, shut down. No more volunteers, nobody is coming in, no more programs, no more church, no more music, no more nothing. Boom, everybody is in the cells.</br></br>

Everybody is going to have meals brought, we're going to do a modified program. The whole prison is going to go on this and we're all going to rally together to beat this, and everybody's going “okay, that's great.” At the beginning of June, so we had March, April, May, right. Beginning of June is four months: zero cases, among the inmates.</br></br>

Few guards- they would on- but see they would only test if you said “I'm sick.” They didn't want to do general testing, the prison. The guards, they asked them, “Are you sick?” They say no.</br></br>

Fine, go to work. Well, if you're making $35 an hour, $30 an hour and you're making time and a half and working overtime and doing that five days a week or four days a week, are you going to turn the money down because you have a little bit of a cough or something? Probably not.</br></br>

So who knows where all those cases started coming in. There was a judge, I think it was [redacted] who I was been told that he was the guy who was appointed federal receivership over the whole states in 2006. Because the medical situation was unconstitutional it was horrible.</br></br>

And San Quentin was pretty good. They had a new medical facility and the doctors and the CMO, the Chief Medical Officer and stuff were actually pretty good people. And you could get what you need.</br></br>

But, so 120 guys from Chino, who allegedly had filed some kind of a class action or some kind of a brief to the judge saying “get us out of here,” I think that's what happened. And so they'd all been tested, they were all being held, pending transfer. The judge overrode the CDCR’s mandate to no transfer, freeze-in-place, and brought these guys in.</br></br>

So they brought them in, they quarantined them for two weeks and tested them before releasing them back out. Within a week of them being there, and we were told they were completely clean, the inmate cases started one, five, seven, 12, 18 whatever and it kept going. When I paroled in July of this year, July 13th, was when they actually physically let me go, there were close to somewhere around 1500 cases.</br></br>

And within 10 days, it was almost two and a half thousand, like another 1000 cases. And they were dropping the prison population. And they were sending people like me who had gotten sick, who tested positive, who was still sick out into quarantine, under this Project Hope program that Newsom was doing.</br></br>

So I ended up nine days in quarantine at a Travelodge. And just before that I'd spent 17 days in quarantine at San Quentin with another week before that knowing that I was sick, but them saying “oh you probably don't have it.” They came to my cell with my- with two of us in a cell and they say to my cellie, “you're- you tested positive.”</br></br>

He says, “I’m not sick. I have no symptoms.” I looked at the guard and said “we're locked in because we can't- this modified program.” And I said, “What about me? I'm feeling like hell.”</br></br>

And he said, “Nope. My clipboard- nope, you’re not on here.” But we tested the exact same day. So, and it wasn't till a week later that they admitted to me, “[redacted] man, you got it. Dude, you have it.”</br></br>

Meanwhile, I've been sick for a week, and I had to go what they call man down. So, there's a clinic, there's an emergency. And the only way to get to the emergency is if you do- you call- it's a command it’s to the guards “I'm going man down. I'm sick as hell and I'm going to fall down on the floor. So take me immediately to emergency.”</br></br>

So they did, and I was suffering from the worst nausea I've ever had in my life, chills, aches, pains, but no congestion and no fever. That's the weird thing. No taste, the loss of taste, loss of smell.</br></br>

Everything tasted like gasoline- would smell. I mean, I couldn't even drink cold water. Fatigue, couldn't eat, I lost probably 12, 15 pounds, which is probably a good thing.</br></br>

It's a hell of a way to lose weight. But I'm telling you, I did. And so they they took us out of our housing unit and split up all the cellies, they put us in different cells.</br></br>

And I was 17 days- they put us in a place called South block in badger section, B section, which is badger section, which they usually use for reception: guys coming out of jail, sit in these cells until they're classified to go to their final destination to do their time. So it's transient, and nobody cleans it. And there's white supremacist graffiti all over the walls and swastikas and the thing’s dirty and the mattresses are nasty, and they weren't giving us any soap or towels or anything for a few days.</br></br>

And we were getting food but it was brought on trays from the chow hall that was cold. And finally the- all the inmates get locked down, so there's nobody to cook the food because the free staff is not going to do it. And then the free staff fell to COVID, so they couldn't come in.</br></br>

So then it's the guards that have to do it- mind that at one point we were getting three three bag lunches a day, which is either state bologna and bread and an apple. Well apple’s good, but- and water from the- I mean, that's basically what it is three times- or peanut butter. So it's food, and you're getting calories, but there's like no vegetables, there's no there's no meats, there's no I mean, you don't want eat to bologna and- no, this is bad stuff.</br></br>

We don't know what's in it. Peanut butter isn’t bad, you know, for that kind of stuff. But you get enough of it, and eat three times a day or whatever and, and you're in the cell by yourself on the bunk, boom, because the cells are tiny.</br></br>

So eventually the- within a week, the- the plant operations engineers came through to start putting power to the cells because the guys have little chargers and things to- for batteries, for CD players, to listen to radio. There was no TV, there was no nothing. And a lot of guys, a lot of us, you got to have a TV, that's how you see the world.</br></br>

Otherwise, you got concrete walls, and the cells are tiny. The cells are four and a half feet wide by 10 feet. And you got two guys in there, and it's rough.</br></br>

But this was just single cell, which I understand now that they've started moving people back. The viruses burn through, there's less cases, so a lot of guys are now still single cells. They gutted the chapels, they pulled all the pews out of the Catholic chapel, all the benches are out and the seats and everything, and they took all the churches apart and made them bed for COVID.</br></br>

They did the same thing to PIA, which is the Prison Industry Authority. That's the mattress factory and the furnish factory that guys are work in, they gutted the whole thing in space for beds. The gym, which was for recreation.</br></br>

They set up tents on the lower yard that look like field hospital tents, big ones big like- put guys in there, just so they can spread people out because they've known for years that this is- there's no way for social distancing. I mean, you can't even keep a social distance from your cellmate or your cellie or your cell next door. If you go to the bars, there's bars, there's not doors, and that thing is bars it’s wide open out into- And you got a guy you could- if you could, you could just reach around and grab his hand, let alone be socially distanced from a guy in your cell.</br></br>

So if he's got it and you don't, well, you're there- you're quarantined with him. It's- it's San Quentin was built for single cell. It was built for like a maximum of a couple of thousand.</br></br>

And when I got there in 2010, there was over 6,000 people. They had people in the gym, they had people triple bunk. Well, once they get away with it long enough to have two guys in a cell, that's- they welded the bunks in.</br></br>

They have two guys in a cell that was built for one. That's it- that becomes normal. Do that for a decade and it's well, it's just what we do.</br></br>

Well, it's unhealthy and it's wrong. But that was kind of a digression from the COVID but that was absolutely what made it spread like wildfire. And people were washing, they were giving us little bottles of sanitizer thing, but not much.</br></br>

And once we hit quarantine, it was basically “good luck.” The doctor might come by, you know. The nurses did come by every day, and they check temperature with a gun, and they'd have to go there and they, you know- and they would check your- your blood oxygen by putting the thing on your finger. So I mean, there was that.</br></br>

They did- medical was doing everything they felt they could do- that everything that custody would let them do. But- and they're saying “you gotta get these guys out of here.” And custody is saying “sorry, we-” now they never have there- there's nothing to- as precedent to tell them how to operate, to tell them how to do this.</br></br>

So they were making decisions by the hour. And you had guys from death row, I heard- I was- when I was in the clinic. I heard the nurses talking and saying, “Yeah, a couple of guys came in from death row, one of them was saying he didn't want any treatment for COVID.</br></br>

"It's my way out of here.” So what is that: suicide by COVID? And the nurse and the doctor that were talking, just talking, chatting about it, we're saying, “Man, that's terrible.” While the guards are saying, “well, that's what happens, oh, well,” until some of their numbers started to die, too.</br></br>

So I don't know what the total number is at this point, but I know that it's more than 25 that we've lost. And most of them have been inmates, but there have been a few guards, a sergeant. And it's a shame, these guys didn't have to go like that.</br></br>

But prison is hard on health anyway. And if you don't eat well, or you don't stay active, or whatever, you put yourself in a compromised position. It was the worst disease that I've ever encountered, I wouldn't wish it on anybody.</br></br>

And the goofy thing now is I want to get back from this, I want to- I've got the antibodies, I know I've got em. But I cannot donate blood to people who are doing plasma, because I've been in prison. If you've been in prison more than 72 hours, you have to be out more than a year.</br></br>

So they're missing, they're missing out on, you know, some few thousands of guys that have paroled out of prison in the last 90 days, that could be giving COVID- giving plasma, they probably would be willing to do that. So who knows. It's just the insanity of it all.</br></br>

But it was really bad. And there are guys there that were very sick too, they're still there. Now, I know that there's some efforts to try to get some- not early parole, there's never really been early parole.</br></br>

As a lifer, you have to go to the board. So hopefully, I know, in my case, it helped, that COVID was in fact, active. I went April third.</br></br>

So March 18 is when they locked us down. So I think that had- played, you know, had to play in something. 65, you know, that's the age.</br></br>

So all of this in there. But there are guys that got exposed, that got tested positive that hasn't- it hasn't affected. So how do we advocate for these guys? There was a huge amount of people that were marching on San Quentin and I have photos on the phone that people have sent me, and big banner that said Incarcerated Lives Matter, which I think is very cool.</br></br>

You know, and just for us sitting in- in the quarantine with the guards going “Sorry, I got nothing to tell you.” “Well, when are we going back to our-” “Well, I got nothing to tell you. Just shut up and and hang loose. We'll figure it out.”</br></br>

Meanwhile, you know, but just knowing that those people were out there doing that. It was a big deal. We had a couple of guys who went on a hunger strike, to try to prove a point.</br></br>

And I'm talking 10 day hunger strike. But that's something that people need to know about. And anybody who chooses to say that this is a hoax, or this is not real: you know what? You got another thing coming.</br></br>

Because I would wish it on nobody. But it was one of the things that when Trump got it, you know, I had to wrestle with my own emotions about that. But I said maybe this is going to soften him a little bit, maybe this is going to pull compassion in his- in his heart to realize that it's- no you don't inject bleach in your veins, you don't do that kind of stuff.</br></br>

But this is some- put the money into the research, get the vaccine- do that. And well, anyway.</br></br> 

UCI: What was it like just, I mean, when the cases first started, the fear must have been incredible. I mean, you know, what kind of environment that you're in, that it's a closed environment.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah.</br></br>

UCI: How did you cope? How did everyone around you cope with that?</br></br>

Caller: The fear was palpable for a lot of guys. You know, in prison you kind of have to buck up a little bit. You know, you're always there, somebody is- that's the one thing about Quentin and these programming prisons,there's somebody always ready to listen.</br></br>

So you can talk, you can say- you can, and there's enough inner strength to say “I am afraid.” But it was there. And a lot of guys, were- very few people were voicing all the, “it's nothing, don't worry about it.”</br></br>

People weren't saying that. Saying, “I understand. I understand.” And the medical staff was good. You know, they had their hands tied, it must have been incredibly frustrating for them.</br></br>

Because there was only so much that they were allowed to do within this context. Prayer, meditation, talking to friends, voicing it, writing letters. I mean, I wrote some really weird letters.</br></br>

People were like- when I got out to and talked to em they said, man, we got those letters, and  said oh my god, this isn't [redacted], you know, but I guess I, there's a, there's a real emotional component to COVID. And in that kind of a situation, you kind of say- in that situation, it's like, it's the anxiety is even worse. So you have to just ride it out sometimes.</br></br>

It was hard. It was really hard. And it was intense.</br></br>

And I think that discovering that now too with a lot of people on the streets that have had COVID is that there is anxiety, there is a dimension to it that is not just physical. That you know, and I'm still feeling fatigued at times. I'm still feeling my smell isn't back.</br></br>

And taste is okay. Pretty good, I think. Some things taste great, you know, so I guess I guess it's there.</br></br>

But, you know, weakness, imbalance. Sometimes I'll just all of a sudden feel like I have no- my equilibrium just shifts, and then it comes back. So I don't know if that's that or I'm just getting old or whatever, but I have to think that it's from that too.</br></br>

And so it's- it's- it's got some long-term effects to it.
