This story was told by a person incarcerated at Vacaville.</br></br>

UCI: Okay, so, what has the COVID situation been like at your facility?</br></br>

Caller: Okay, number one, when it started last year, right, I was in the so-called, that's why I'm saying so-called, [redacted], that's outside this main line. But, it's inside the perimeter, but I mean, it's outside the main line setting here, the building. It's supposed to be the ADA, because I'm ADA, and medical prisoners.</br></br>

Okay, when the COVID started, okay, the breakdown, I wrote this in the letter, the originality of the COVID-19 virus in the system started with prison guards at Chino. Down at Chino, at Chino in San Bernardino County or Riverside County. It's right there.</br></br>

And the guards brought it in, and then the prisoners ended up getting it. Well, what they did, the California Department of Corrections, transported a bus load of prisoners that were positive to San Quentin, okay. At San Quentin, you know, the population is big.</br></br>

Well, after they got there, ended up 2,000 and something prisoners ended up being positive with COVID out of a population of 3,000-something. And then, from there they sent some prisoners here to Vacaville that were sick, and it started spreading here. Plus, we have staff coming in with COVID, too.</br></br>

Caller: Okay, so, this was last year. Okay, so then, on a, they started giving us the, what do you call, the swabs, the nose swabs, on a regular basis in the dorm. There's two dorms out there. Supposed to be level twos, ADA and medical, but they made the [redacted] into a dog dorm. So, they got a dog program there with so-called ADA and medical patients.</br></br>

And I wasn't in that dorm, I was in the [redacted] dorm. So, during that time people that ended up getting positive were moved out and we had all negative results in the dorm until they started moving people from [redacted] dorm over to [redacted] dorm that were positive. In other words, they're sort of playing musical chairs and a whole bunch of people started getting sick.</br></br>

And then, after that they came in with tents to put on the yard, right, for people that had COVID. They brought National Guard Army tents in and closed down the yard, and put up tents for people that have COVID. Because a whole bunch of people here were getting COVID.</br></br>

Well, what they did, those supposed to be positive, they would take a negative prisoners that was from inside [redacted] dorm and put them out there in the tent with the positive person. And what they were doing, just playing musical chairs. That's why a lot of people started getting sick.</br></br>

Okay, on January – let me see, January, okay, right before January [redacted], a prisoner across from me in the bunk, because it's an open dorm setting, a prisoner across from me was taking a second vaccine, and he had an allergic reaction to it real bad.</br></br>

He started getting chills, cough, and getting sick, headaches. And so, right away they moved him out and put him in quarantine. Well, the next day after that, this was on January [redacted] of this year, they came and got me and got other guys in that area, in that vicinity, and said, "We got to put you on quarantine because you were in the radius of this one prisoner."</br></br>

So, they ended up moving me inside in main line here to [redacted], which is quarantine now. All right, the next day on the [redacted], I don't know who this doctor was, he's some new, unknown doctor – I found out from one of the RNs that he was from San Fran – from Marin or something, the hospital in San Francisco.</br></br>

Anyway, he came in and did a swab. And then, the very next day he tells me, they come in late at night and they tell me, well, you're COVID, you tested positive for COVID. All this time I didn't test positive, I was testing negative, and all of the sudden this strange doctor comes in and says I tested positive. So, they had to move me to the COVID housing.</br></br>

Caller: And, man, when I went in there was nothing wrong with me. I'm going to tell you right now. Look, [redacted], they call it the zombie housing because, man, if you ever seen the movie "The Walking Dead."</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>

Caller: This place was sub-zero freezing like you were in a morgue.</br></br> 

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>

Caller: And I was freezing. Plus, I'm allergic to wool blankets, so all I had was some cotton blankets and I'm freezing to death in there.</br></br>

Okay, well, that was the day they moved me. The very next day I go into the shower to take a shower because, you know, I didn't get a chance to shower before. So, I go in to take a shower and they got a big old giant fan blowing ice cold air. And this is in January, the end of January. Blowing ice cold air. And when I got to turn the hot, you know, the water on.
