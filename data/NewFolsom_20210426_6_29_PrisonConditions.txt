UCI: Okay, and what has the COVID situation been like at your facility?</br></br>

Caller: [unintelligible].</br></br>

UCI: I’m sorry?</br></br>

Caller: Sorry, like my full address or just my cell number?</br></br>

UCI: No no no, what has the COVID situation been like at your facility, like how has the COVID been there?</br></br>

Caller: Oh, well right now, we on, they got us on quarantine because of the COVID. I guess somebody had contact with COVID but every like, two weeks we get on quarantine and they lock us down for two weeks.</br></br>

UCI: Mhm, and like, what else does that consist of? Like, social distancing and masks and things like that?</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, they have us wearing masks but we don’t like them. Keep it honest, you know.  And they won’t tell us who got the COVID-19 when they do say somebody got it.</br></br>

UCI: And so, since people have been getting vaccinated now, like how has the vaccination situation been like at your facility?</br></br>

Caller: Well, me personally, I’m diagnosed with a low… immune system and I really don’t, can’t be around people, I guess, because of, because of the virus. But however, it’s, like, kind of hard when we deal with a bunch of people every day and the police only give us a minimum amount of hours outside of our cell. They only give us 15 minutes to shower and then a phone call and then we go right back in our cell, which sucks.</br></br>
