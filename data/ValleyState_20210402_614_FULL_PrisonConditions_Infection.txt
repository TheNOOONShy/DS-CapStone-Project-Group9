I truly hope when this letter lands in your presence, it finds you in the best of health and in good spirits!</br/></br/>

As for myself, I’m still breathing so I’m doing better than a lot of others who walked before me since March 2020!</br/></br/>

I was totally surprised and shocked to see some compassion from a total stranger and get a letter like this questioning my health and well-being during these incredibly stressful times. Dealing with this pandemic/epidemic inside this backwards-ran facility!</br/></br/>

I been able to make it from March of last year till December of this year without catching COVID-19. I’ve filled grievances, complaints, and other medical documents regarding my health conditions and different methods that should be considered as a way to deal with people with pre-existing health conditions. The main one being accelerated release.</br/></br/>

I was overlooked on all actions that were taken by CDCR regarding my requests until finally in December I was tested positive. I was shuffled around to different parts of the prison. I had to deal with people being placed in the dorm with me often they had tested positive.</br/></br/> 

Had guys move into the hallway. I was in after they had tested positive after only being quarantined for eight days.</br/></br/>

So much more I can say but it gives me a headache worse than the "Janssen" COVID-19 vaccine I just took gave me! Yeah, I finally got my vaccine shot. But that headache is nowhere near as bad as the ones I been getting from dealing with our situation with our phones!</br/></br/> 

We have eight phones but can only use four at a time. The other fours have to be cleaned and sanitized for a period of 15 minutes before they can be used.</br/></br/>

Makes no sense especially when there is a plexiglass divider separating us from being next to one another. We are in a building with eight people in a dorm. All of us are what you call “resolved,” had COVID, and we fought it off. Eight dorms so that’s 64 people and only 32 are put on the phone.</br/></br/> 

But they will pile eight people in a dorm all day, 24 hours a day without social distancing, and they act like it’s nothing wrong with it!</br/></br/>

This administration/medical has absolutely no compassion, no consideration for all the problems we experience. With being away from our family or lack of communication we get with our family!</br/></br/>

The phone will be empty and the CO will tell you if you’re not signed up, won’t get on the phone.</br/></br/>

I’m done sharing my headaches because I’m getting a migraine. And to top it all off, my back gave out and my sciatic nerve done blew out! So I’m gonna bring my pen to an end for the day! Hope this will give you a little insight on some of what I go through!</br/></br/>

Feel free to respond. It’s always a pleasure to receive a positive thought.</br/></br/>

Sincerely.
