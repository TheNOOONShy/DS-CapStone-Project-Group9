<em>This story was told by a person incarcerated at San Joaquin County Jail.</br></br></em> 

UCI: I mean you already talked about some of the things that I could ask you about, but you were talking about how COVID has affected you and your family. If you wanted to talk a little more about that, I mean how being in jail during COVID has affected you and your family, your situation.</br></br>

Caller: Oh, absolutely. I mean the visitings have been cancelled. So, I mean I haven't seen anybody for a year, nearly. And the little bit of timeframe they did open up, they just closed right back off until further notice.</br></br>

So, I mean I get to call them, but calling from jail, it's expensive. I mean you're talking seven dollars every 30 minutes just to talk to your family. And if you ain't got the money, you ain't talking to nobody. That's that.</br></br>

They were giving out free calls, but they took those away. First, they started off with two free calls per week. Then it moved down to one free call per week. And now there's no free calls.
