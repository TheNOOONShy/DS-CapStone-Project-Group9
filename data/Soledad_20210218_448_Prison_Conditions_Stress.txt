Theme: Prison Conditions: Stress


I am responding to your form letter regarding life in prison during this pandemic. Thanks for asking. So, Pandemics & Prison. Oil & Water. Your first question is "What has it been like inside prison during this time"? Back in March as this pandemic was ramping up, those of us paying attention knew that it was a matter of time before it made its way into prison.</br></br>
What we did not realize was that because this prison is in Monterey county, as are the majority of migrant workers that do not have the means to "avoid" the pandemic by using precautions advised, that the virus would get here as fast. The guards at this prison are primarily Hispanic, so it puts them even closer contact with the Hispanic population, than probably others. You then couple that with the fact that most guards here are ignorant [ignorant, not stupid] to the seriousness of this situation at this prison they have negative attitudes towards inmates and negative attitudes in general, and that is a recipe for disaster.</br></br>
Many comments like, "heh heh, that's one way to lower the prison population". As I write this, the news, KION CBS NEWS, here locally, just aired a piece about this virus exploding in the Califomia prisons and here where I am specifically, as of today December 23, there are 839 positive cases here.</br></br>
I'll go chronologically as this thing progressed. The first thing that they did was to stop all contact visiting before a single case of COVID was in here. Smart move, yes. However, it also spotlights how incompetent the staff here have been in dealing with this pandemic. The spread in here was not inevitable. It was preventable, but poor attitudes, and poor administrative oversight, allowed it to enter the prison.</br></br>
