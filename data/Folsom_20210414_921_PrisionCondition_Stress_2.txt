For ten to 14 days, doesn’t sound bad on paper right? Except for number one. Prison staff make their rounds and walk through all three floors at their pleasure, cross contamination. Number two, inmates in ad-seg must be escorted at all times. There is no establishing order as to who escorts who, so we are unable to get escorted physical holding or grabbing us.</br></br>

By staff assigned to (redacted). Number three, everyday on our way ou to the walk alone yard, we must pass by (redacted). Let me mention that where we are housed, there are no solid doors to our cells. We have opened bars and mesh gates. Number four, there isn’t very much adherence to PPE and sanitation rules by staff.</br></br>

They’ll put on a pair of gloves and touch anything and everything, and handle our food, laundry, and personal property. Since CDCR first cancelled all visits, we were supposed to receive phone calls more frequently to keep in touch with family and loved ones. Not much has improved in the regard for those of us in ad-seg, we are entitled to one call a week. But are only receiving calls once every two to three weeks, depending on the mood of staff.</br></br>

Some staff purposefully run calls at inconvenient hours to create difficulties for some inmates. Or they run the calls in random order and so skip some of us. It’s incredibly frustrating we have filed 602 complaints, but have seen little relief. It may appear inconsequential to an outside, but I assure you it is not. I have not seen my family in over a year. Finances aren’t great so I can’t call collect as often as others, and the mailroom staff here.</br></br>

Are by far the most inefficient, and unorganized. An incoming letter takes anywhere from two to four weeks to reach us. Your letter is postmarked March 2021. So there is an obvious strain on my family and my relationship with my wife has deteriorated. The prison advertises video visitation but has yet to inform us how to apply for one or how our family can register.
