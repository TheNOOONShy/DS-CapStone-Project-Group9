This story was told by a person incarcerated at Kings County Jail.</br></br>

Caller: Hello?</br></br>

UCI: Hi – hi, go ahead and continue; I don't have to go through the consent process again.</br></br>

Caller: Okay, thank God.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, same – if it's the same person, we don't have to hear it again.</br></br>

Caller: Hey, alright – I'm like, thank God.</br></br>

UCI: Okay, here we go. Third time – third time's the charm.</br></br>

Caller: All right. I can just – I can just pick up?</br></br>

UCI: Yep.</br></br>

Caller: Okay. Yeah, so these — these – these types of things, you know, that go on, they happen, you know? Even to you – you may not even understand the difference, you know?</br></br> 

And that's honest to God, ma'am, you know? You may not understand the difference, and be like yeah that – that is, you know, well maybe and I – I’m not saying that, you know, you have to say anything, but maybe you can – you think back.</br></br>

"Well, man, I was in high school, and I remember I dated a guy that was older. I dated – I was a junior or sophomore and dated a guy that was a senior." You know?</br></br>

And I – I didn’t in - you know – maybe I – we continued dating afterwards, or I don’t, you know what I mean? Or I know a friend that did, you know?</br></br>

Man that yeah, but technically, you could get in trouble if that man is 18 years old or if the guy's a – if it’s a guy and the girl is older, you know what I mean? Technically, and you can get a year in a county jail. You know what I mean?</br></br>

They can give you a year and it’s – it’s just called sex with an underage minor. And you know, it’s three years older. And it’s – it's not as like prison time, but you can get a year in a county jail, a year with half or six months.</br></br> 

See what I'm saying? That's what I got.</br></br>

But you're like, "Man, that was – that was my high school sweetheart. We were dating in high school." But all it takes is a – is a dad or a mom to complain, you know? And saying that woah, you know?</br></br> 

In my situation, it was – it sucks because the dad was cool with me, you know? Me and the dad got along, you know? And - but because he was a correctional officer in the prison.</br></br> 

In prison he was a counselor, he knew the DA’s very well in this community, because he was also a representative of – of a – of a program called Champions here in the community, and so his word went a long ways. Mind you, his daughter – me and his daughter, yeah, we cared for each other. We liked each other a lot.</br></br> 

I was young. I was only a year and a half out of high school myself. But, what she was doing on the side, and other things she was doing, she was seeing older men, 30 years old, 35-</br></br>

I mean seriously, there’s even – there's deputies here that know my situation and been like, "Yeah, we know the dad." There's some that worked in the prison before and worked with him and heard the – heard the things that the man said. "Oh yeah, he's your age. He’s this and that – Well I’m not trying to –"</br></br>
 
And they – they spoke up on my behalf and said, "Why would you do that to him?" You know? It’s – you know what I mean? </br></br>

Why would you even do – why would you do that to somebody, you know? That guy is – is probably the same age as your daughter. They're both right there, why would you even?</br></br> 

Your daughter – you're not understanding what your daughter's doing. Look at what she’s out here – you know what I mean? And I – I know you I – I had to sit on my knees, and I cry, you know?</br></br> 

It’s – it hasn't affected my life, or my dating life, my relationships. It hasn't – it hasn’t affected none of that, but, you know, it's affected other parts of my life, you know?</br></br>
 
It – it affected me. Cause I'm like man, why do you have me registering with – with different, you know, all these different people, you know? I don't have none of these crazy, you know what I mean – why do you have me doing all this?</br></br>

I shouldn’t have to because it’s – if you look it up, it's 261.5(c). When you get off this phone, I want you guys to take your time, I want you guys to really look it – look it up; 261.5(c), and it'll tell you too, "Three years older."</br></br> 
And you'll be like, "Yeah, he's really telling the truth. It's only three years older. Damn." 261.5(c), and you’ll – you’ll be like “Wow.” It'll tell you the difference and it’ll tell you.</br></br> 

You can get felony probation. You can get a year in a county jail with the six months, and that's what I got. I got a year with – I got a year with half.</br></br>

That’s – that’s, if you have a rape charge or child molestation, you're going to prison. That's something serious. You're going to prison. I didn't have nothing like that.</br></br>

But when you go to prison, if you have to register, when you go to prison, a person doesn't see that. All they see: "Oh, he has to register. He has –" And all they see is “Oh you have to register.”</br></br>

So, they think anybody that has to register; “Oh, you'll have to deal with somebody that's being a weirdo, or being a – you know.” You know what I mean?</br></br>

And – and officers, these correctional officers, they show your paperwork and they show that to these other inmates, and it causes harm to you. That's why I asked you that question. Do you think somebody deserves to die for that?</br></br>

Your high school sweetheart or somebody that you knew — you're two years apart, three years apart, compared to somebody that's – you know, 20, 30 years, you know, and he did five year, ten years old? No. And I’m not saying they deserve to die. It's not right cause it’s not – you're not the judge.</br></br>

I’m not – I don't like that. I don't agree with it. God, at least the Lord in heaven knows I don't agree with it. I helped pray to God that I am never even – I’m never even in that position to know some – to have something like that happen to my future child or anything, you know?</br></br>

But reading the Bible, it's teaching me, you can't – you can’t judge these people though. And they're right, because I look at – I see how I’m get – how I get judged.</br></br>

You can get – you can pee in public. You can pee in public, that’s indecent exposure, and you have to register. You have to be in SMY/PC, you know, all this stuff.</br></br>

You have to go through that. And people thinking that you're some type of weirdo or some people go, "Oh, he's a sex offender." "He's this-" or "He's that."</br></br> 

You don't even understand what they're saying. You don't even understand that – that there's a humongous difference. There's no comparison. But you guys don't know, can't fault you for what you don't know.</br></br>

But when people are doing projects, people are – are doing studies, test studies, test cases, they wanna study this, study that, what you've really got to study, you’ve really gotta look into it. Really look into these things and look at this difference and look what's going on. Look at — Look at, and be like "Yeah, you know, that is different."</br></br> 

The public should know about this because they sit there and hear this, and they think they've got weirdos and they’re – they’re, excuse me, excuse me Lord, but it – they think they've got people that are offending kids and all these different things in their area just because he is – "Oh, he has to register." "This person lives right next door to us." No.</br></br>

You've got somebody that lives next door to you and had his – had his member out in public because he was taking a leak on – on a tree. You've got somebody that was homeless that has nowhere to go that got turned down by a restaurant, couldn't use their restroom, and taking a leak outside.</br></br>

It's not okay. I mean, it’s – it’s – you know, it’s inhumane, you shouldn’t – a human being shouldn't have to be using the restroom outside, but it happens. It happens.</br></br>

But he got caught, or somebody think he was doing something and now he's in trouble, you know what I mean? Now he's going to court over indecent exposure, you know? Now he has to register possibly if the – if the judge deems it necessary. And these are the types of things that people don't see.</br></br>

But you’re following him, you’re thinking he’s – you don't know who's next door to you. You don't know because you're not looking into it. You don't go meet the guy. You don't go talk to him.</br></br> 

You don't go interact with him. You're just thinking the person's a weirdo. You're just thinking the person's a creep.</br></br> 

You’re just thinking – you don't know what's going on in a person's mind. You're making – you’re making judgments. It's just not right. It's not right, you know?</br></br>

So, I just think that’s – It’s not just – it’s – it's all of us. I've been – I’ve been – I’ve been suspect of doing the same thing to people, you know, looking down at homeless people. Looking down on people.</br></br> 

It’s just the things that we should do and man, if we're gonna do something, do it with a full effort. Really give our ear and really listen. Really make a difference too.</br></br>

Really stop these things because there's not a prison here in California that – that doesn’t have something illegal going on. And that's their staff. That's the workers there.</br></br>

And I don’t care – you know, me personally, I don't care about somebody dating somebody. Somebody, "Oh, you're dating this person. Or this person’s dating their–" I don't care about – “That's cool.”</br></br>

I don't care about no stuff like that. What I care about is how you're treating people. The things – the illegal things that are going on, you know? The – the – the fights. The violence. The things that you're allowing.</br></br>

I know personally, me personally, I don't care like when people – people are dating. People are going to date because that is what – that is what men and women do. They – they find somebody attractive, they date.</br></br> 

It's not unusual, that right there. But what’s not okay, what’s – what’s – that's fine. But what's not fine to me is – is you – you abusing your power, you - you causing violence, you causing harm to someone else.</br></br>

You're allowing things to go on like that. Taking a life? Allowing harm, danger to be done to someone? That's what’s not right.</br></br>

You turning a blind eye? You not having cameras set up around that? That's – that’s a dangerous place to be, that prison.</br></br> 

And you not having cameras set up and things – and things you know, things there to – to show, you know what I mean? Why? Why don't you let the public see these types of things? Why?</br></br>

And that’s why I was saying, you know, that man, I thank – I thank God for the bravery that – that officer – that fellow correctional officer showed by writing in the papers. It was in the Fresno Bee. It was last week sometime.</br></br>

I don't – I don’t remember exactly what day. I don’t remember if it was, I don’t know if it was, I don’t think it was this week. I don't think it was Monday. It was either Sunday's paper or – or Friday's paper, one of those papers, newspapers, but it was the – it was the Fresno Bee.</br></br>

And you look into it and it was on the – it was on the page, they talked about the man was just saying, that he – he took his life – but before he took his life he wrote a letter. And he was in the Investigations Unit, IGI, and he – he was part of a – he investigated crimes inside of prisons, deaths, drugs, and drug visits. People trying to bring drugs in from their family members, and stuff like that.</br></br>

They would do all that investigating stuff. People stabbing victims. They investigate all that.</br></br>

And that man told the truth. He said how he was mentally and – and emotionally abused by – by his fellow coworkers because he didn't agree with those things that they were doing. Because he said there was falsified documentation going on. He said murders that were covered up, things that were allowed to happen.</br></br> 

And that’s – that’s at Folsom Prison. Look at that story. Look into that story. That's at Folsom Prison.</br></br>

And all these people – now basically, these people – the face – these wardens and these people now, these assistant wardens, people want to get on here and – and this is what happens in California State Prison. These – this, ma'am you can go everywhere around these – the state.</br></br>

In this – in this state right here – you go around to these different prisons, in this California, and you're gonna find something going on. You're gonna find something that they shouldn’t be doing – that's very much illegal.</br></br>

But it takes somebody like that, that has the courage like that to set everything in motion for everybody else. They should have an investigation done in every prison in California because they're gonna find something. If they do it right, then people are gonna lose their jobs.</br></br>

People are gonna lose their jobs because the things that they're doing are not right. When you're allowing someone's life to get taken and you're covering up things, falsifying documents, you have no right to be in that position because you've abused your position. You abused it.</br></br>

You took advantage of it. Not to say that you allowed someone's life to be taken, deliberately, on purpose. You're supposed to be a standup official.</br></br> 

You’re supposed to – you’re supposed to be – do you know what you stand – when you take that oath, when you swear in, when you take that oath? Even as an officer, any type of law official, senator or judge, when you take that oath, this very country that we were born in, this – this country that you represent and that you swear to protect these laws is the same laws, is the same country that it was founded on God.</br></br>

And for you to sit there and – and to – to do those things? But then you sit there, and you go on TV, and you guys, you people want to sit here and, “Hey, well look,” you know? And you wannna be the face of this company, you wanna be the face of this – you wanna be the spokesperson of this; how are – how are you going to sit there and do these things?</br></br> 

How can you really have the guts and really the audacity to speak on national television and say these things? Say all these wonderful things, say what you’re – what you’re not against, and say you're against this, say you're, this is rehabilitation, we're here for this, and you want to show these programs, but you don't show what's actually going on inside of your – inside of these systems, inside of these programs.</br></br>

It’s just – it's a lot of things that are not right. It's not. And I’m not here to get – like I said, I'm not here pointing fingers at people, but I want that light to be – to be shone on these things because that's what happens. That’s what happens.</br></br>

And it’s just – I have a way of looking at things. I – I just – I want, I want everyone to be able to get help and get assistance. I want help. I want assistance.</br></br>
 
And I can’t – I can’t and I’m – I'm not given that because of why? Because an attorney doesn't want to go out of her way to help me in my situation because she's not getting paid? She's getting paid regardless.</br></br>

But – but, you know, there's just so much that's – that’s being done. Like you have to pay an attorney for them to do anything for you. If you don't pay an attorney, you get one appointed to you by the courts, a public defender.</br></br> 

It’s hard – it's hard to get help. The assistance to have them go and – and investigate things and then go and seek things because, to be honest with you, ma'am, they're – they’re gonna get paid regardless, you know? Those are their friends, the DA, the district attorney.</br></br>

Those – they work for the courts. They're not working really for you when they're supposed to. What they're doing is trying to get you a – a deal that they think is reasonable. That they think is reasonable and the DA think is reasonable.</br></br> 

They're not really trying to work for you. They're not really trying to help you. They're not really trying to see that you need help, that you need assistance. They're not trying to do those things.</br></br>

It takes you to pay an attorney. But if you don't have the money to – the money to pay an attorney? Look at all these different celebrities. It's because they have money.</br></br> 

It's because they're able to get a top-notch, good attorney that's gonna go battle for them. That's gonna get them the charge they should be charged with, which is a lesser offense. "Ah, this felony go down to a misdemeanor."</br></br> 

You can clearly see it should be a felony, but man. But they got it down to a misdemeanor.</br></br>

Here you know this – this here, it'd be the – it’d be the same thing. "You know what? This should be dismissed. You know, this man has issues. And this right here was taking place. He was under the influence – "</br></br>

I mean, man, there's so many different things – so many different factors to factor in and this attorney could do, and she's not doing anything.</br></br>

It’s just it – it’s just – I’m just, I'm amazed and wowed. And I want help, I want assistance, you know? Like I said, I don't have – I don’t have no hard feelings towards any of these individuals, you know?</br></br>

I just want help. I want help. I want help.</br></br>

Prison and – and jail is not the answer for every – for every – for things. These men that are commit crimes, that have done things, and it's not the end of the road for them, you know? You didn't take nobody's life. 

You didn't kill nobody. You – you – man, it's not over. You – you stole – you stole a car.</br></br> 

You took a car, you – you – because you were high under the influence. So you stole a car. You know, you – that doesn't make it right, doesn't make it okay.</br></br> 

But you didn't steal a – you didn’t take a life. You didn’t – you're not killing someone. You're not causing harm to – you’re not punching someone.</br></br> 

You're not damaging someone's just – someone’s life, right? You're not doing these types of things. I mean, seriously?</br></br>

A person could be helped if you're doing things behind a drug addiction. You’re doing things you – behind this, behind this drug. That’s – that's the honest to God truth, ma'am.</br></br> 

People – these are things that people need to see, you know? And I've heard people – a lot of people say, "Well, you're worth it – you’re–"</br></br> 

You know, I've been in and out of this place, man, so many times, and people say, you know it’s crazy even – even how the women treat you. You know, it’s like, “Man!” You know I’ve lived my life, you know?</br></br>

I haven't dated women in a while, you know? And it’s – it's affected me, you know?</br></br>

I've been here in jail, you know, in and out of jail. But, you know, even women are like, “Man, how can you set a law in place or – or say it's unethical for a person to date someone?” Why, you know?</br></br> 

If I’m out there, if I want – if I want – if I change my life – I want to change my life and I, living to do – to do something new with myself and just – just totally change up everything, you know, why can't I have the opportunity? Why can’t I have the opportunity to have a good woman, a – a healthy relationship? Something that – something that - that is going to be good for me, you know?</br></br> 

Why can't I have the opportunity of that? Why, because of – because of my background and her – and her career path?</br></br>

So you’re saying that I’m not worth the – what? What are you saying, you know? Truly I want to understand this because if I no longer intend to live this type of lifestyle, then what's stopping – what’s stopping me from seeing someone?</br></br> 

What's stopping me from having this – getting this blessing? Who are you? Who are you to take this and say that what God maybe is bringing together or maybe has in store for me; who are you to say that that can't happen?</br></br>

Why do we limit – why do we set limit on things? I mean, technically, it's not – it’s not illegal – it’s not illegal for things like that to happen. So – so it’s like, there's things in life and just this world that we live in; man, I just - I just disagree with a lot of things that go on, you know?</br></br> 

It’s – I just – I have a voice, and I want to use it. I want to use it to – to bring about change, to make a difference, you know?</br></br>

UCI: Yeah, thank you so much for calling in and for your willingness to share. Hopefully, we can get these stories up and make people aware of this type of experiences you've been having. That's what we're here for.</br></br>

Caller: Oh – oh yeah, absolutely. Is there a time – I mean cause, I mean, there's more I would like to share, not right now, though, I’m done talking. But is there another time – another time I can call back?</br></br>
