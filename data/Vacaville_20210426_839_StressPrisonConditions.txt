This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Vacaville.</br></br>

Hey these days have been so unbearable, I’ve been in and out of quarantine all last year. We were not allowed groups and I was in the department of mental health. I was denied board last year and my mom was sick. I only have five years left, I wrote the governor to beg him to let me out a halfway house or a sober living program.</br></br>

I’m doing enhancement time, my controlling case was only resisting arrest and zero criminal threat, and I was sentenced to 20 years. I got hit with ridiculous enhancement time, which should have been illegal. Help me get in touch with our governor. Tell him I don’t even know my kids, never met my daughter at all.</br></br>

I’m in here over a woman scorned because I have another girl pregnant. Now I might lose my life because I started messing up out of anger. My trial was set to fail me and possibly get me killed in the county riot and prison riots.</br></br>

They won’t let us get out. Just throw us in a cell and forget we are human, they expose our food to air, we don’t get laundry. This place has no outlets for TVs. I’m trying to go to a mental hospital till I go home. I’ve burned my skin with flames on 10 different occasions. I’ve had skin grafts. I’ve sliced open my wrist and veins. I’ve hung myself a couple of times. Hear voices.</br></br>

John 16:24. I’m 40 years old. I’m bipolar and I hear voices and sometimes see things. I was in my fathers’ hands on Christmas when I was three, and he blew his brains all over me while dying in my arms. It’s all on record. This happened in Fontana, California.</br></br>

Just a man who wants to make it home to his kids and start a new life. I gave my life to Jesus Christ and the Father has a plan for me. I’m going to baptize and shower the homeless and poor. I’m gonna start a chain of food trucks and do CDF firefighting.</br></br>

I went to fire camp, on my first number I was discharged and successfully, and didn’t get to tell the jury in which that would have raised reasonable doubt and got me acquitted. My lawyer failed to call my old PO as a material witness because people were calling him lying on me.
