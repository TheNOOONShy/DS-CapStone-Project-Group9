Hello PrisonPandemic,</br></br> 

Well, for me I have had no visits in the 15 years I have been in prison. I was hoping that I would be OK while inside, but the free staff and correctional officers who come to work infected with the virus and don’t know it really did some damage. I personally was woken up at 11:30 (23:30 hours) September 23, 2020 and told to pack my stuff, I’m moving.</br></br> 

This was just a way to spread the virus around inside. To inmates who did not have it.</br></br> 

I have been infected and by the grace of God I did not get sick. I lost my taste and smell and that was back in September 2020. I received your letter on February 18th. I’m sorry it had taken so long to write but I've had no stamps and because I am not indigent to receive envelopes, I had to wait.</br></br> 

This is called patience, I have learned to use it as often as possible like everyday, every minute, so much. Sometimes I lose track of what I am waiting for. We receive write ups (115s) for not wearing our N95 mask. I had it down to we, inmates, lived on an island and we would be OK. Well we all know how that turned out.</br></br> 

Everyone got sick, some died, and we still have dorms on quarantine and they are new arrivals coming from county jails. All in all I am blessed to still be alive and I’m thankful for it. So it all boils down to being thankful about just being able to breathe. So thank you for caring enough to write to me and others. I know many did not write to you so I thought I would.</br></br> 

By the way I have had all my test come back negative since December I caught it in September. Thank you very much.</br></br>

Sincerely.</br></br> 

P.S. I have gotten both my COVID shots one in February and the other in March.
