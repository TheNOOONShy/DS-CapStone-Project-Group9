This story was told by a person incarcerated at Twin Towers Correctional Facility.</br></br>

UCI: What has the COVID situation been like at your facility?</br></br>

Caller: What has the current situation, what?</br></br>

UCI: How has the - how has the COVID situation been like at your facility?</br></br>

Caller: My facility, it's pretty strict, and it's going through what we hear on the television. Like they have rules and mandatory shots, and all those things are going into effect, but there are certain leniencies that we get in the - in our pods. We have to wear masks when we go see the - if we have appointments and leave the facility, the dorms.</br></br>

UCI: And what has it been like for you to have reduced visitation and program?</br></br>

Caller: Well, the very - programs were discontinued at the beginning.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: And I was in a school program and nobody came and left, the teachers. And I was trying to explain that I was in a hospital and when the corona had - had moved in - it - we couldn't see staff and continue our groups. So, that kind of stopped everything. We were - everything was just put up.</br></br>

UCI: I see. What do you think would make the situation at your facility better?</br></br>

Caller: More volunteers. More like people helping. They had all kinds of people coming in, like mental health people, but we couldn't see them.</br></br>

And more like they did kind of enforce sanitizing the place, like doorknobs and door handles, and anything that was around. I think that would be better if they kept doing that. But we don't see that, that much.</br></br>

UCI: So, they stopped doing that?</br></br>

Caller: No. They didn't stop, it's just they - they rarely do it. Like they don't come into the cells. They do it where - they're more active when the pods are quarantined. They go and they spray around so nobody else gets it.</br></br>

UCI: Okay, I see. Do you - do the officers wear their masks?</br></br>

Caller: Yes. Used to not having their masks. So, when they leave or have to go out they have to have their masks on.</br></br>

UCI: Is there anything else you want people to know about your experience?</br></br>

Caller: Well, I had a very tough time. I had to go into surgery and God willing I made it through. And my family was also sick, and they also need surgery but they pulled through and they didn't need surgery.</br></br>

But I ended up being up here and it was very harsh conditions for me to try to pull through with a reversal colostomy and pull - you know, make it. Even though I went to several places, like - by - how do they say, like I traveled to different jails and different hospitals. And it was - it was pretty harsh for me to kind of pull through because by court order I was having to take medication that I wasn't used to and then I would have allergic reactions to it.</br></br> 

So, I'm still undergoing that right now. So, it's very kind of hard to explain but it's pretty - I'm just glad that I - that I made it through. And I'm still gonna, I hope to get out before anything gets worse with the pandemic, to see my family.</br></br>

UCI: I'm so sorry to hear that about your situation. And I hope things will get better for you.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, I hope so.</br></br>

UCI: Is that all you would like to share?</br></br>

Caller: I would feel better that I sent you a letter, but also explaining what kind of my story. And I'll - I'll call back and let you know that I sent it.</br></br>

UCI: Okay, yeah. Go - please send a letter. Thank you for calling and participating.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, I'll look into see what this program - I don't have no internet access. I don't know of this program. So-</br></br>

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: Okay. I'll just - goodbye.</br></br>

UCI: Thank you.
