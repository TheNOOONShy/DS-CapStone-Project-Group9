This story was told by a person incarcerated at Ventura County Main Jail.</br></br>UCI: Oh okay. And also, you mentioned one of your family members passed away, my deepest condolences. I also wanted to ask you how has the COVID-19 situation affected your family members?</br></br>Caller: The truth, well a lot because my family here stopped working for a long time. My mom got sick with COVID, my sister got sick with COVID too, my brother in law too, only my brother didn’t get sick, I don’t know why, they all live in the same house. And the truth is it does make you think what’s going to happen because my mom was sick for almost a month, she wasn’t that bad but looking at how the situation is, we did not know if one of these days we were going to have to hospitalize her. Similar, my sister was a bit sick, not a lot but she was also not working for a period of time, well last year they stopped working. And it was difficult because we have to pay rent, food and everything.</br></br>And from my family side from Mexico we all suffered the passing of my aunt because she is the oldest from all of my uncles, and she’s the one that would oversee everything in the house with my other uncles and everything. And the truth, right now that she is not here, it’s a disaster in my house in Mexico because my aunts don’t like each other. Well it’s a mess, but the truth is COVID has affected us one way or another, it’s affected me and my family because they’ve gotten sick as well. And the people who surround me here, well I hear their family as well has been sick. But yes, it has affected us a lot to be honest.</br></br>
