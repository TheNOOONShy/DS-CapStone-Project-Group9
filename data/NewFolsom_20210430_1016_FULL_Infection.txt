Dear UCI,</br></br> 

Hello, my name is [redacted]. I’m writing in regards to the pandemic stories. Well first I'd like to say all my COVID tests have been negative. Lucky me.</br></br>

Well, having the pandemic in prison has made things a lot more complex and very frustrating. When I first arrived I was placed in quarantine for 14 days. I was locked in a cell and unable to use the phone to call my loved ones, and on top of that I had to get swabbed everyday which was very irritating. I’m sure you know why.</br></br>

When I first heard about the vaccines I was skeptical about getting the shots because I wasn’t sure about what was in the vaccine. I didn't know if I was going to be injected with the virus or what it would do to me. But I ended up getting both shots without any side effects.</br></br> 

To be in person with the COVID-19 made things unpredictable because anyone can have the virus, then that means the whole prison will go into quarantine. No one likes to be in quarantine because we don't get our commissary, yard, or any packages.</br></br> 

How has the pandemic been for you? I know some businesses are opening back up which is a good thing right? I would say that my safety is not in jeopardy, but I don’t want to jinx myself, because I can catch it at any time.</br></br> 

UCI students, if it’s not too much to ask, I would like some feedback on my story and what you think. I would very much appreciate it.
