This letter was written by a person incarcerated at SATF (California Substance Abuse Treatment Facility and State Prison).</br></br>

First and foremost, I’d like to start by thanking the entire PrisonPandemic project of UCI and most importantly the writer behind the postcard I’ve received in the mail today. I highly appreciate you from the bottom of my heart.</br></br>

Because not only am I going through COVID-19 issues, normal trials and tribulations that I face in prison on a daily basis, but I also was just improperly denied my release upon Prop 57 yesterday for the second time. Which placed me back in a vulnerable position to question myself and my purpose and also the Lord.<br/><br/>

Even though I’m suffering with keeping my faith in the Lord, I still pray! So this morning I prayed “God please give me a sign so that I know I’m doing the right thing." Then, out of nowhere, after not receiving mail and Lord knows how long I get this postcard from you guys filled with inspiration in love. So again, gracias! You’re a blessing in disguise.<br/><br/>

Secondary, I pray that this brief missive finds the whole UCI foundation in the greatest health mentally, physically, and spiritually. Last but not least I’d like to wish all of you a happy New Year’s with many more to come as we, me, and the whole entire UCI facility add onto our wisdom, strength, uniqueness, and success!<br/><br/>

Now as far as my experience goes behind walls under the COVID-19 pandemic? Let’s just say I’m used to the mistreatment, the unsanitary, and etc. Been going through it for six years now. The world is just finally getting a chance to walk in our shoes in other words get a dose of our medicine. To be honest, the only hard part for me is no visits or phone calls due to the fact that I’ve lost my girlfriend, my father, along with other friends and family members since my incarceration.<br/><br/>

So I get very worried a lot and deal with anxiety on a daily basis. But, besides that, I’ve learned to cope, so no complaints. Now if I hadn’t learned to cope oh bets believe I can go on and on and on how jacked up present is. In fact I’m working on a prison TV script called “Hebrews 13.3” which means in biblical scripture “remember those in prison as though you were in prison with them.” It’s based on inside prison fact, so keep an eye out on me. You might see me on TV one day. I am extremely multitalented.<br/><br/>

I rap, write poetry, I have my own clothing line that I’m working on along with the magazine that I’m working on getting published. That being said if any of you have any interest in my vision or any info that may help with my goal accomplishments, please contact me at the address listed below or on my JPay tablet. Thanks for reaching out to me. I highly appreciate your concern and hope to hear from you sooner than later, I exit as entered with much love and respect!<br/><br/>

Sincerely yours.
