This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Stockton.</br></br>
I hope that you are in good health and spirits. Please excuse my j trusting upon your busy schedule. Gracias for receiving my letter. I very much thank you for considering me or thinking about me, in order to arrive at a judgement or decision.</br></br>
Or to suggest giving thought to, in order to reach a suitable conclusion in your act or process of your pandemic writings of many acts of art of forming visible letters of hundreds, if not thousands, or prisoners characters and views of a very horror of a pandemic.</br></br>
The many true and real letters of characters that serve as visible signs of ideas, words, or symbols. Our many letters, notes, or notices used to communicate our records of our many horrors and of our opinions or decisions. Therefore, I am very much grateful that you have even considered my proposal. Or if my statements regarding my facts pertinent to a situation in question.</br></br>
In your request to me it clearly states that you very much like to hear of my technique, or process of representing in a plan or curved point of view recalling the subject as they might have appeared to me.</br></br>
My capacity to view the COVID-19 pandemic, things in their true precautions or reactive importance of a Mexicanos point of view. Then to view my own task in my large framework. Now to be clear, first and foremost, in my agreement to this letter, it should be noted to the writer that it should not be noted that I am a “Hispanic” because I am not. For I am a Mexicano.</br></br>
Please be mindful, it is very much important that we, as a raza (race), as a gente (people), that we very much continue to maintain all of our positive attitudes during this pandemic, or all of the things surrounding us as a people. Otherwise, things will end up getting worse.</br></br>
Hermanos y hermanas, usually I don’t share this with just anybody but I do think that it should be elaborated. As an imprisoned Mexicano, serving a life without parole, and incarcerated since 1967 (yes, 43 years in prison).</br></br>
It’s very difficult to criticize The circumstances for which I am condemned. For as I stated before, that I am a Mexicano, when it comes to my situation, a brown man serving a prison sentence, where I have come to find a pandemic. I am not guilty as charged, and do not deserve to pay the price for a crime I have not committed.</br></br>
I am still a human being who experiences The many thoughts and emotions of a human due to this COVID-19 pandemic. This time of mine has now become very much mentally damaging. At first, not really knowing as to what COVID-19 really was, or how and when it might affect me. Or was it something designed to produce a distinctive or desired impression.</br></br>
It is now becoming very frustrating, confusing and filled with anger or even self-pity. Affected with or expressive of grief, or unhappiness. However, in my own particular situation, and this day forward, I am benefiting from it all.</br></br>
Unlike the many people out in the free public, who have never experienced a form of meditative state or act or process of meditation marked by a conductive silence. Then to be able to focus on one’s own thoughts or reflect on, or be able to ponder over to plan and project in one’s own mind.</br></br>
As to the many active mental qualities, or state of being mentally active, such as the vigorous or energetic actions that one’s own mental state holds or has to offer. Instead, their mental thoughts are nothing but what they are not capable of providing themselves to keep themselves active.</br></br>
Unlike the many people out in the free public, I am located in an underworld of few escapes. I am forced to see myself at face value and there is no running away from the truth. As time has wheeled it heavily on all of us, in this subframe Society.  Now, we have found ourselves facing a pandemic that does not even utter it’s threats against its many ills. That also gives no signs or warning of the seriousness that does hang dangerously and without announcing its intended or possible works or its many strikes of it’s deaths that awaits us all of the pandemic porten evils.</br></br>
An expression of its intention that inflicts its many evils, of its many injuries, and or damages an indication of something impending us, if we catch COVID-19. As I owed, or owing as a natural or moral right, according to accepted nations and guidelines or procedures, that allows all to appreciate the many Satisfying needs and obligations and or duties of means, adequate, regular, and lawful.</br></br>
Duties that do require us all are expected in the prescribed and normal or logical course of events that allows us all not to catch nor get the coronavirus! With us and the process, we are all doomed for failure. And on mission of occurrence or performance, are failing to perform our duty or expected actions. A state of our inability to perform all of our normal functions to continue to remain safe.</br></br>
Due to our practicing or giving way under all of our many stressful failures and of our lack of successful patience. Of all of our failing businesses, bankruptcies, for all those who have failed they all first need to be thankful that they had not been under the worst circumstances, or under their state of extreme depression or apprehension.</br></br>
Although the many horrors we had experienced, or many events that make up our country are past of a community, or nation, or even mankind generally. Once again something personally encountered or undergone or lived through. Our many acts or processes of ours directly save events or reality. Have not yet even witnessed nor seen by me, or other people now. Except that does not mean it does not occur, perhaps you may imagine exactly how they might have been?</br></br>
I had forgotten that you have to experience incarceration, if you were to experience such imprisonment, your direct observation of or participation and such events as A bases of knowledge or of the many tortures.</br></br>
To make your systematic examination especially to conduct your official injury? Allow me to suggest your investigation, most begin at a hospital known by many prisoners as the hospital one goes to die! As one is sent there, and does not return. You may experience professionalism by visiting the San Joaquin hospital here in Stockton for yourself.</br></br>
And during your visit you will find that the hospital is swarming with a great number of correctional officers immigrating together as a hive without their queen. Where they have now started their new colony. Elsewhere at the San Joaquin hospital where they have now settled in a new hive, an agreement of three floating females that work there, where themselves have become their new queens. From the hours of 4 PM to 9 PM and also in the morning hours, and if they allow you into the upper floors, where they house the prisoners. Only then, you will see why prisoners often die.</br></br>
Where the dismay can and will cause you to feel horror, to fill with distaste, shock, marked by or conductive to horror. Extremely unpleasant or disagreeable, only then may you find the real secretive manner, that you may enjoy as part of the free public. The real peace and relaxation of these correctional staff due to the best money can buy, that is acquired by possession, ownership, or write to the use or services of my payment. Especially taxpayers money. To obtain an exchange for something often at the sacrifice that keeps people incarcerated and of course the COVID-19.</br></br>
The removal of a bunch of unneeded prisoners of all races! A successful finishing of a new holocaust is simply being undertaken. All due to the cause of an active event of an infectious disease. All of a large group of sub microscopic infective agents that are regarded either as extremely simple microorganisms, Or as extremely complex molecules. That typically contains a disease known as COVID-19. Our direct observation of or participation in our events as a basis of knowledge, practical knowledge, or practice derived from our own direct observation.</br></br>
Participation and events or in our particular activity, especially our own causes of compassion or sincerity of sympathy. Not essential or permanent care for ourselves, unless someone such as yourself comes along that reminds us that we still have human form or attributes susceptible to our representative of our sympathies and frail of human nature. Therefore we as primates are characterized by tending to our broad humanistic nature.</br></br>
Therefore, as once mentioned, most of our freedom to go from place to place without purpose or direction, that has not allowed us to wander or purposefully two there to limit us to move from place to place. Therefore, I only hope you do finally learn or find out that you’re actually writing the truth and in the point of fax and do not suggest something unexpected without bias.</br></br>
In the hopes of a politician or any person with experience in the art or science and government, especially one who is engaged in party policies as a profession. A person primarily interested in practical office or selfish or other narrow usually not short sighted reasons. Or end up reading not what is said or what you find out other than the truth. That the many other prisoners' voices that have been silent can now finally be heard and told.</br></br>
Due to your free society you are often told a bunch of lies, and mischief via TV. Simply so the California corrections and their union, something that has been made one. Something formed by a combining or correlation of party or members. Who continue to profit and work by doing anything all day long. Except to continue doing while not at work, and that is sharing through the computer. Looking for things to order online or watching animals or people doing weak things of intellect. Instead of doing work things, doing work hours, and watching sick and ill prisoners.</br></br>
For which they are being paid to perform, instead of spending their working hours online. For their own personal matters and purpose, instead of attending to their patients, to looking after them or to paying attention to them. To go and stay with their patients as professional nurses or servants or to service professionally as physicians. That follows their own hypocritical earth to do no harm!</br></br>
Then to apply themselves as professionals and their work as professionals as nurses/physicians, then to have themselves to be controlled by threats or operate with the hands of manipulation by correctional staff. Mechanical means especially in a hateful or in a strict full manner or to control or pray upon by artful, or insidious means especially to one’s own advantage.</br></br>
And ask for professional nurses and aids present as caretakers or one that is employed by a public servant, especially one that performs duties about the persons or homes and as personal employers.</br></br>
Well, here’s where this brief letter does come to a close. I very much hope that I have done some purpose to your present pandemic, or have done some good to allow those who have never experienced such horrors. As being a COVID-19 patient and or incarcerated prisoner, where the nurses profession is more caring what is placed online to place an order over t
the employees computer than to serve and or care for an in prison patient.</br></br>
Allow me to thank you for your time and effort and hopes and sharing the truth of COVID-19 while being incarcerated from our point of view. Except there have been many unseen horrors and one that is known as being tortured, destroyed, or sacrificed under any of various conditions of this virus known as COVID-19.</br></br>
One that is subjected to oppression, hardship, or even miss treatment and for this, they have paid with their lives. Only known as victims, and those that they do not care for. Simply due to the fact that they were incarcerated prisoners or societies worst. Just another form of racial prejudice or discrimination. Simply due to the color of their skin and due to the majority of people incarcerated are either Mexican, brown, or Afro American.</br></br>
Perhaps some good will come out of my writings. Only to know that no one really cares, just as long as it is not happening to them or to their family members. Be reminded that bad karma is not prejudice. I am sorry for being late.</br></br>
Something to always remember!</br></br>
If we were to know eternity, we should know that we are never separated from one another with whom we have ever been with. We come to a different part of ourselves, each and every day, and we phase the part that has separated us. In time it is no longer except in eternity, it has always been there.</br></br>
If we face eternity we would know what we have done to any person. What they have done upon us, is gradually changing. We now think it is over and done with, except and eternity, what we and they had done to each other is always there. Always changing and altering with each and every day as we grow a lot better. We tend to act much differently and we will also act quite differently.</br></br>
If we face eternity, we all would know that we are always living in our own lives, and that is always changing through all of our eyes. That we may only see the parts that we are in now.</br></br>
And our present is just our concentration to live attending to one another at a time. That is if we are together as human beans. If we were only to know eternity?
