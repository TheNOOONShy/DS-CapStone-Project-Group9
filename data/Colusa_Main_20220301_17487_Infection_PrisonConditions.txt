This story was told by a person incarcerated at Colusa County Jail.</br></br>

Caller: Okay, so in [redacted] we have to do our COVID tests right when we get in there, and then we quarantine for 14 days, even though the tests comes back negative. When an outbreak was in the county, they locked us all into our own cell and we were tested everyday, and we were also taken our temperature and our vitals. And they used sanitization after everyone would go out and use the phone or use the shower.</br></br>

Here in Colusa, none of that is available. I know it's like, you know, tax dollars aren’t supposed to be paying for that kind of stuff, but we don't have any sanitizer in our rooms or our housing whatsoever.</br></br>

There is no mandate to wear the masks. They are not masks that are supposed to be worn due, like what the news says. So they’re just like, not the masks that are, obviously, I don't know how to say it. But anyways, sorry, I got distracted. </br></br>

There’s like no, there’s no sanitation going while walking through. There was an outbreak in the Colusa County Jail and they were still delivering trays of food from each sector. So even though somebody might’ve tested positive for COVID and they were turned away, it was still in, the virus was still in here.</br></br>

When it happened in [redacted] county, there was girls that were testing positive and they were keeping them in the same module. So they’re still using the same phones as well as the same showers, and there was no sanitation done and there was no testing as well.</br></br> 

So in [redacted] county, if there's an outbreak, you weren't getting your vitals and quarantined or anything of the sort. Oh, and they do offer the COVID vaccine, however, in [redacted] county and as well as in Colusa County, you can get the vaccine.</br></br>

UCI: And does that mean any brand does it and they offer a second dosage or a booster by any chance?</br></br>

Caller: They offer the booster in [redacted] and the first and second dose and then here, I believe you have to do it in three visits. So they do it all individually.</br></br>

UCI: Okay thank you. And then thank you so much for comparing all of them, that's really helpful.</br></br>

Caller: Sorry.</br></br>

UCI: No, no, thank you. It’s much appreciated. What has visitation looked like in each of those for you?</br></br>

Caller: Oh, so this is what's really bad. So visitation in [redacted] or in [redacted] is moved to IWA visits. So our family members have to pay every time they visit us for 30 minutes. And I believe it's like, I don't know if it's illegal, but [redacted] county doesn’t offer visiting at all.</br></br>

There’s no visitation at all. So girls are in there for months, and some girls have been there for the entire time of COVID and have not seen their family members at all. And there’s innocent ones in there, you know?
