<em>This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Orange County Central Men's Jail.</br></br></em>See I was here when this whole COVID-19 (lie) began. I still think it was an answer to so many people's prayers (an act of God?) as the doors here at TLF would spit out so many people in January-April 2020.</br></br>I was then 11 months into a "no bail hold" due to the OC probation refusing to allow me to separate my PV from my new charges. On probation, you're guilty until you plead guilty again.</br></br>But due to COVID-19, the courts could no longer keep their end of the Constitutional rights. Quick and speedy trials as well as preliminary hearings went out the door. Most people I know were sent home on zero bail, or my own became $70,000 which I gave $700 to a corrupt bondsman to buy my freedom.</br></br>I personally grievance the sheriff's deputies going home daily, the housing of people from the streets. Plotting my life at risk, to which I never received answers. I was here when the "hot meals" were taken away. Now its bologna sandwiches three times daily, no hots!</br></br>And I spent 13 months on the "frontline" with criminals, prostitutes, and addicts in motels and various other non-permanent housing. I was out to get my stimulus and PUA monies. To see the rampant around.</br></br>I have spoken with a youth in Ghana who (like myself) has never witnesses a single case of COVID-19 and says the politicians kept the international aid and made every death a COVID-19 death.</br></br>Seriously, in 13 months I have never met one person who had COVID so what exactly is in the vaccine for a virus that doesn't exist? Who knows. But nobody in here or out there I know will take it. We think it is the virus people who do take it get sick, real sick.</br></br>And the protocol in place seems more for a radioactive type of situation from a viral one. Why wasn't the Beirut explosion last August on mainstream TV. Even Trump saying they were bombed. Looked like a tactical nuke to me, might COVID-19 be fallout control in disguise?</br></br>Would you tell the world if nukes got used? Probably not.
