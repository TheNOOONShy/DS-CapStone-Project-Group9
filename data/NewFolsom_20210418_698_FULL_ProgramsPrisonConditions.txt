This letter was written by a person incarcerated at New Folsom.</br></br>April 18, 2021</br></br>Sunday</br></br>Dear PrisonPandemic,</br></br>It's good to hear that someone of concern, concerning the outbreak of COVID, "the pandemic." And yes it has caused delays. Travel here at prison, as well as on the streets. Being locked-down without able to work. What's happening now.</br></br>The family with the kids working at home, home study, virtual classes on a AV-10 lab-top. The pandemic has hurt the economy and virtual-classes ain't-enough-money-to-pay the bills. My family on a budget and times are hard. Both at home and in prison.</br></br>I'm glad you wrote me. I have plenty of stories. I have what's been happening here in prison concerning "the pandemic." It's been already just over a year. I've been here about 16-months going on 17-months. I'm doing my best to stay focused.</br></br>I'm enrolled in college right now. Working on a PhD medicine. You wrote me at the right time. Bio-tech, bio-technology, my major. The school in this area is UC Berkeley. I looked at some of college courses and don't have the specific courses I need for my PhD.</br></br>So I would be interested in maybe some information concerning college courses at UC Irvine. I live nearby in Woodland Hills. It's in my best interest to pursue my goals and a career. Concerning today's world dilemmas: epidemics, crisis, vaccines for the diseases.</br></br>California Diseases Control (CDC) doesn't know what they're doing. And it seems like a growing problem here at prison. "The pandemic."</br></br>A revolving door looking for a way out. Away from the chaos and confusion. Prison isn't where I want to be. I'll be looking forward to hear from you. I'll call soon.</br></br>Sincerely.
