This story was told by a person incarcerated at Vacaville.</br></br>
Caller: I'm a prisoner at CMF Vacaville. The pandemic seems to be just overwhelming. There’s- there’s inmates dropping off like flies. Um- to the left of me, to the right of me, across from me. I mean, inmates sleep within three feet of me. They’re fallin’ off like flies um- 10, 11 inmates in the last seven days. I have underlying conditions. I live in fear of my life every day. I should have been out of prison. Please call if you can help me in any way. Please do. I need help. I need help. I'm not just- I need help. There’s truckloads of bodies. They’re sick and- they’re still sick. Thank you.</br></br>Please help, if you will. My medical conditions are underlying and life threatening. And no one seems to care. No one. And I need some type of help. Please, if you’re into helping us, please write me. Call the number below for help. Thank you.
