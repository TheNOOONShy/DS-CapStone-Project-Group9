This story was told by a person incarcerated at Corcoran.</br></br>

UCI: Oh yeah, no, no problem. We really appreciate you for calling in and being able to tell us your story and we hope to let it be heard to the people. I also wanted to know what have you been doing personally to be coping with this crisis? ‘Cause I know  it’s a lot.</br></br>
Caller: Well, let me tell you this first. I get family visits and the last time they visited was I got was in February of last year, this is causing a strain on my marriage, it’s causing a strain just dealing people in here. I’m dealing with hundreds of people but millions of personalities, each individual has 10 to 20 personalities a day depending on what the day is.</br></br>

So, you know, sometimes it’s hard, and as I say, they always pushing and not giving, it’s to the point where it’s a real public health scare, we supposed to be on quarantine row, and they got inmates passing out trays and picking up trash and all this and all that. So, if that ain’t bizarre and cruel and unusual then I don’t know what is. So, they want to sit on their ass and sleep and everything else.
