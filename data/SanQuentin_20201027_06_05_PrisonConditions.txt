This story was told by a staff member at San Quentin.</br></br>

Caller: The housing situation was still conducive to the COVID spread, although they had reduced some of the population in the dormitory setting, which were about 200 placed inmates per dorm. That was dorm three, four, and five, and then dorms one and two were only 100; they were a special population.</br></br> 

They did create a gym setting, but still the cots were less than six feet apart, and the ventilation systems were not adequate to filter out an airborne or aerosol contaminant, like COVID. The housing units were still five stories tall, open-barred, and social distancing was impossible. There was absolutely no way to physically distance, including staff.</br></br>

The situations with masks were such that officers would put on, some, most officers, I would say, would put on their mask if their superior were around. But most of the time, they chose not to wear their mask, or wore it with their nose exposed, or around their chins. I had witnessed personally, not last month, officers going around the tiers, meaning the housing units, talking about how COVID is a joke, that they hope they get it because then they get a paid vacation. Not issuing sanitary supplies, from the very beginning to the very end, in the quantities that were needed to ensure that inmates were not getting exposed or infected with COVID.</br></br> 

The medical care was simply monitoring for those who were COVID-positive, and there was no separation, in the beginning and in the middle, that infected patients were still housed with un-infected, or non-positive COVID inmates. So it was pretty bad.</br></br>

I am still in touch with former colleagues, and it’s still, the pervasive problem is getting the corrections officers to buy into wearing their masks. It’s still an issue, and it’s an issue so much so that it’s been commented on from staff to superiors in meetings, public meetings, and there’s just no way. There’s literally no way to enforce mask usage.</br></br>  

UCI: Mmhmm.</br></br> 

Caller: And that’s what we’re being told, that's what we're - they were being - well we were being told kinda what the current staff are being told at this point.</br></br> 

UCI: Mmhmm.</br></br> 

Caller: Or they would tell them this truth, and say, “No, everyone’s compliant.” But these are the management team, who are not on the ground, who are not in work spaces where inmates are, they’re sequestered on a different floor, so they have absolutely zero opportunity to make sure that there is mask compliance.
