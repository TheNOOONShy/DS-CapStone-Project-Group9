Due to the pandemic we have even less contact with our families. I am blessed with a great family who visited me every weekend for 16 years without fail. What seems like moments, I haven't seen them in going on a year now. It's only adding to an already frustrating environment we live in.</br></br>


Still, I worry more for my family both healthwise and economically rather than my own well being. I am housed on a maximum security level yard meaning we rarely come out of the cells as it is. None have been found positive as of yet. For once I appreciate the minimal movement we have here.</br></br>


Thank you UCI team for thinking of us and giving us a voice.</br></br>
