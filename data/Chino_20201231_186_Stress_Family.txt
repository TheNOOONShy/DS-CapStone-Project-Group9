This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Chino.</br></br>

And I'm scared to test positive again, because the shuffle will begin all over again. And I'm tired. My life has an expiration date, time is not on my side, at all.</br></br>

I just want to be left alone, to not watch any of my bros die from this, or suffer the crazy things the prison people decide needs doing. When I call home, I'm always hopeful, And put on a brave face, I lost my grandpa, 104 years old, earlier this year. And I know my grandma is going next soon. It's a terrible feeling, to have all this regret over my terrible choices. The least I can do is try to outlive them so I don't break their hearts anymore than I've already done.
