This story was told by a person incarcerated at California City.</br></br> 

UCI: Let me first ask you, how has the vaccination situation been like at your facility?</br></br>

Caller: Oh, they actually came by pretty quickly. They actually - they gave out a lot of vaccinations. But that's another thing. A lot of the population is vaccinated, right? </br></br>

They say 70 percent of the population in the world, right, or whatever? So, that's called herd community, herd immunity.</br></br>

UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>

Caller: So, if this is a prison population, right? And 70 percent is vaccinated of the prison population, wouldn't that cause herd immunity within the prison?</br></br>

UCI: That does sound pretty plausible. I - I'm not too sure how these statistics work.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah. No, I'm just wondering cause like, they act like-</br></br>

UCI: I think that is a good idea though.</br></br>

Caller: Nobody's been vaccinated. Yeah, they've been acting. They act like nobody's been vaccinated, nobody's like - you know what I mean? Like, they act like, at any moment, we can get sick, when in reality we don't bring the virus in here. You know?</br></br>

Somebody has to bring the virus in here, and it's them. It's them going inside our cells, searching. They're searching our cells during a COVID pandemic.</br></br> 

They pulled us all out onto the yard and put us in a group of, what, like 100 and something people on the yard. And went in our cells and searched. And that's following COVID protocol. That was last year during when it was hitting hard.
