Perhaps from the outside, it may seem things are as well as can be but it is an accumulation of inconveniences that makes things difficult for us inmates. I understand prison is my punishment and I am reminded of that almost daily, but the lack of effort by staff and the unaccountability of their mismanagement and during the pandemic, is not part of the judges sentence. Lastly, you ask how are the vaccinations going for us. I donâ€™t know how general pop is fairing, but Here in ad-seg I have yet to see anyone be offered the vaccine.
