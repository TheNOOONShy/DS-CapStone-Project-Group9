Dear PrisonPandemic,</br></br>

I have received your message, it took a bit because I got transferred to another prison. Thanks for reaching out to me, sometimes I feel like I don't matter. I been through so much at this point, I'm just glad to hear from you. But here goes my ordeal.</br></br>

On April 9, 2020, they removed my adrenal gland so I had surgery at San Joaquin County General Hospital. They have a contract with the CDCR. Now it was supposed to be a normal surgery laparoscopic, but someone dipped and cut the wrong vein so when they start removing the adrenal gland, I started to bleed out. I almost died. They worked on me for six hours. It was painful and I ended up with a 15 inch scar across my stomach.</br></br>

Now by June I got really sick and they figured out my other adrenal gland didn't work, so I was put on hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone, which makes the immune system weak. Now for the next nine months I was systematically exposed to COVID-19. I mean I was around people who were positive. I used to have to go to yard at the building where the COVID people were.</br></br>

They use the COVID to take all our programs and visits for COVID, but yet fail to provide us with cleaning supplies to sanitize our cells. I have to clean with shampoo. I've seen a COVID positive person move from a cell and they put me in there without cleaning up.</br></br>

I'm in prison for a crime I did not commit. I was convicted of driving a car which someone shot someone out of. Well being convicted by police misconduct, I kind of went mad and I committed crimes in here. I ended up with four life sentences for the attempted murder I didn't do, and then for cell extracting which I got charged for assault with a deadly weapon. The one where you don't even hurt no one. The weapon a thin aluminum pipe and the resisting I got life for each of these.</br></br> 

Now I should have been let go when they released all them people. I have been clean for five years and have rehabilitation certificates, but because I used to be a gang member they don't believe it unless I snitch. They wont even consider me. But yeah, it sucks to have a medical condition, a serious one, and know if I catch COVID-19 I could die and I can't even be kept safe from that COVID.</br></br>

I have to do it myself. Well I'm not coping with this because I feel like Ima die in here. Well please write back. Ima spread the word so everyone writes you. Thanks.</br></br>

Sincerely.
