This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Chino. </br></br>

I want to scream at the idiocy of the state paying for addicts in the immediate vicinity who steal chemicals from the clinic, mix their own batch, and inject themselves and others in the neck, arm or leg three to four times a day at taxpayer expense, practicing medicine without a license, and destruction of state property themselves, or the inmate workers paid to make the prison wine to sell where neighbors throw up in my living area, start fights, or play their music loud. It gets worse in the name of rehabilitation. </br></br>

When asked to lower the filth, a malicious confrontation takes place defining elder abuse. It takes eight taxpayers to support each one of these idiots, some getting paroled in a month or two to a neighborhood near you. With all of this in front of me, why must I wear a mask over my mouth when the C-virus enters through the eye ducts? </br></br>

The insurance from the clinic of the illegally-used chemicals is far more damaging than minor respiratory distress. When I brought this up to mental health, I was told that’s the way things work here. Remove the word ‘rehabilitation’ from the agency title, who is receiving federal funds to manage this circus. I would love to teach HVAC, copy machine repair, or beginner’s electronics as I have in the past, but there’s no room for that nonsense.
