This story was told by a person incarcerated at Los Angeles County Men's Central Jail.</br></br>

Caller: They change - they change your clothing and bedding. While they never did the whole time I was there. I think they changed clothes like one time.</br></br>

UCI: Mhmm.</br></br>

Caller: And you only get to shower like - like three - three times a week, if even that.</br></br>

They even skipped like one time a month – one week, during the week, we only had like one time. So, and then, it's just horrible there.</br></br> 

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: It's like - it's you're being punished for catching it, when it's their fault for not doing what they're supposed to by the medical guidelines and whatnot.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah. And they make it seem like it's your fault and just make it even worse for you and just like making it really unsure – making it really unsure as to whether or not you're going to get better. Because you don't know. Like we don't even know, you know.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah. Yeah, there's a lot of people, too, that they don't say they got it. We know they got it. Because they have all the symptoms. You know?</br></br>

UCI: Mhmm.</br></br>

Caller: But they don't want – they don't say nothing. Because they don't want to be quarantined. Because, if someone here, in this tier, has it, they'll quarantine the whole tier.</br></br>

And we can't move. There's no movement. You can't go to court. You can't - you can't go to visits – nothing. So everybody just sucks it up and doesn't report it.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah.</br></br>

Caller: Like I say, of the six people where I was at, I was the only one who - who reported it and went and got diagnosed and said I had it. You know?</br></br>

Everybody else stood there. And they're all mad because I went to medical.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah. But, you know, you were looking out for yourself, too. You know? This was still something that's like new and you don't know. You don't know what - how you could react.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah. I know. People were dying from it, I'm like shit. I mean, even though they feel that way, I still didn't feel like myself. You know?</br></br>

UCI: Yeah. And you said you never get sick, so it's like - because I'm the same way, too. Like I barely get sick. So, then, when I do get sick, I'm like, "Okay. This is serious."</br></br>

Caller: Yeah. Yeah. That's how it's always been for me. Like I've never gotten sick. So it's like, I right away, I knew I was sick.
