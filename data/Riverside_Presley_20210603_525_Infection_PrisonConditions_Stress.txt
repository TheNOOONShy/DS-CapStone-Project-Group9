UCI: So, how have you been coping with the crisis?</br></br>

Caller: Well, last year I was found positive at another institution. Myself and probably over 120 other inmates are currently involved in a civil suit against Riverside County for being infected inside the jail. During that time a sergeant informed my whole pod, tank 14, that the whole pod was infected. And in fact, several weeks later soon the whole floor was infected.</br></br> 

During that time they moved us around like musical chairs. They even at one time put me in the pod with people who were sicker than I was. And all I was ever offered was a basic cold set up. My symptoms were achy bones, runny nose, headaches, that sort of thing, but I saw other people who were in a lot worse conditions. 

Some people were bedridden and couldn't even get out of bed to eat. So, it was a scary time because when we first found out that we were positive we all took it as a death sentence. And all we saw when we turned on the news was people dying all over the country. So, it was not a good time.</br></br>

UCI: Mh-hmm. So, what could you say could make the situation at your facility better?</br></br>

Caller: Well, of course testing. They could have a better vetting system for new arrivals as well as the staff. Because, you know, staff go home and come back every day and we've already â€“ we have documented instances where staff has been known to come into the institution with the virus. So, certainly more testing and just a better vetting system for new arrivals when they come into the jail.
