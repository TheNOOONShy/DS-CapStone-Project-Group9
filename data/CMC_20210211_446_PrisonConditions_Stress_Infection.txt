This letter was written by a person incarcerated at CMC (California Men's Colony).</br></br>

I’m currently serving a 28-year term for PC 211 robbery and PC 243 battery. Eighteen years in, through plenty of adversity and tribulations, this pandemic has caused a constant emotional and mental state of duress.</br></br>
 
There have been several outbreaks inside these walls, and I feel the responses were inadequate due to the lack of procedures. For example, CMC was granted funds for the pandemic which were used to build an outbreak center on C-facility of CMC.</br></br>
 
Two huge circus tents were erected with porta-potties and shower units. They were erected and taken down way too early. I state that because the facility could have been used for the numerous outbreaks.</br></br>

CMC shuttles infected COVID-19 inmates with negative inmates. Which means instead of being confined to living quarters, we’re all in single cells. We are transferred to C-facility.</br></br>
 
I’m personally on A-facility, but have been moved to C-facility for two weeks. Our vitals were monitored twice a day for possible symptoms during this time. There is no movement so no phone calls to loved ones or those held dear to convey your circumstances or hear how your family is holding up in society dealing with government shut down, loss of employment.</br></br>
 
December 18, 2020 I was transferred to Sierra Vista Hospital with COVID symptoms. Due to overcrowding I remained by the outside entrance for an hour. I am grateful they brought out warm blankets to cover me while awaiting admittance.</br></br>
 
Once admitted, the nurses and doctors were thorough except for giving me the standard COVID-19 test. The nasal and/or mouth swab. Diagnosis, COVID symptoms instead of positive. Which kept me from being admitted to an intake room.
