This story was told by a person incarcerated at North County Correctional Facility.</br></br>Caller: I’m in the LA County jail right now, and basically the way these people in here handle the covid crisis when it first happened was they didn’t give us any face masks, they didn’t give us any solutions, or constantly taking our solution in here. And when we have outbreaks, they don’t give us anything to clean the dorm with.</br></br>They come by and act like they’re spraying the bars with some kind of disinfectant and they just spray the bars and just walk on. And okay, what about us in here? You know what I’m saying? And I got covid twice while being in this facility. And it was just crazy—the way these people treated us.</br></br>They literally came into the dorm, brought in two bottles of solution with a bag of rags, took a picture of it on the table, went to the phones, acted like they put more solution bottles on the phones with the bag of rags in front of the phones, took a picture of that, and then took those bottles of solutions and that bag of rags and went to the next dorm and took more pictures.</br></br>I was like “Wow, this is crazy.” And they want to constantly come in here and tell us we can’t have bottles for solution and we can’t have cleaning supplies.</br></br>Oh, and the court tanks, when you go to court it’s absolutely disgusting. I mean, there’s obviously gonna be trash everywhere, it’s a facility, but I mean there’s cockroaches everywhere inside the tanks, there’s nowhere to lay down because there’s food all over the tanks, peanut butter on the walls, jelly on the walls, and it’s just out of line.</br></br>There’s nothing we can do about it because the second you start complaining, they tell you, “Oh yeah, we’ll get on it, we’ll get on it” and then when you put in agreements, they don’t even respond to the agreements half the time. It just gets thrown out.</br></br>
