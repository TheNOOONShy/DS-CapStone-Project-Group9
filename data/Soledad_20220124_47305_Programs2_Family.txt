This story was told by a person incarcerated at Soledad.</br></br>

Caller: The only silver lining on both fronts was that stimulus check but not everybody got it. No illegals got it. No Mexican nationals, nobody that was from Central America. So if you was a US-born citizen, you got it.</br></br>

And then not everybody got the check. Some people got 1,200. Some people got 600 but nobody got $3,200, and if they did it's rarity.</br></br>

So that was like one of the silver linings 'cause people had money and then they reduced how much food they’re giving us. So I don’t understand that. They call themselves cutting the food budget but it’s weird.</br></br>

UCI: Interesting. You said they have begun programs again, what do those programs look like for you?</br></br>

Caller: So, I’ll give a day of what happened today. In the morning my half of the building came out, so we had like, what they call, the day room. And then at 2:45, let’s say 3:00, they let a building go to the yard for an hour and we get night yard. So we get 7:00 to 9:00 at night and we get from 3:15 to 4:15 on the day.</br></br>

But there's three sessions a yard and there’s always one building out here right now 'cause we’re in this 15 days modified program. So us being in that 15-day modified program allows us to program independently, but they still have workers 'cause the kitchen needs people, and the laundry needs people, and PIA needs people.</br></br>

So they create a critical workers list with like, you know, a certain amount of people in each area so, you know, there’s no crowds or anything like that. When you leave your housing unit, you got to wear an N-95 mask. In the housing unit, you can wear a surgical mask. So you're really never around anybody that's not in your building right now.</br></br>
 
But before they had this shut down, we had like pretty much not regular program, but minimized, like areas. We haven't eaten in the chow hall in two years. So, which to some is great because, you know, you get fed in yourself. So if you don't want to go pick up the tray, you don't have to go out there and get it.</br></br>

You know, visits came back, but they're doing a hybrid system. The visiting is, you can have video visits, but at this prison, they only do it one day a week. So they do it on Sunday, and then you have regular visits on Friday and Saturday, but it would've been better to have video visits every day.</br></br>

And they just have a certain amount of slots for it. 'Cause it's a, it's a computer, it's a desktop computer with a camera in front of it and you sit in front of it.
