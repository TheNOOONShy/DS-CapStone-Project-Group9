This story was told by a person incarcerated at Mule Creek.</br></br>


UCI: So, what facility are you currently housed at?</br></br>


Caller: I'm calling from NCIC, which is a part of Mule Creek state prison.</br></br> 


UCI: And how-, what has the COVID situation been like at this facility?</br></br>


Caller: Well, before we get into that [redacted], can I say this to you first? I don't mind my name being used. I do not care. I mean, what more are they gonna do to me? But the way I got your number is that there's a brother that was here that received a notification from you guys from a young-, from a sister there. And he then shared it with me and so due to his grace I thought it was appropriate to at least, you know, call and express or inquire.</br></br>


Is it okay for me to write to you guys? Is that how you compose the letters? Before I, you know, actually do it to-, can I at least be permitted to do so? At the same time, to let you know that if that's the case, a letter will be on the way, you see, he's gonna be putting a letter in the mail tonight.</br></br>


And in that letter, we-, well, he expressed his, you know, story and I express mine. So, I mean if you prefer to wait to that-, wait for that, I mean, I have no problem with that. But, at the same time, if you would, you know, get it out the way now, I mean, we can discuss it here, as well. I don't want to waste your time.</br></br>


UCI: Oh no, you're not wasting our time. I'm currently on shift, so I'm here to hear your story. You have the option to write the letters, well you said it's already written, but you have the option to send it off. We want, like, you guys to like spread the word, tell your friends to call us, and stuff. But at the same time we are on a recorded call, so I do have questions you can answer now, also. It's up to you.</br></br>


Caller: Okay, well I'm ready, so let's get it going.</br></br>


UCI: Okay.</br></br>


Caller: I will state my name. My name is-. There's not a policy or regulation?</br></br>


UCI: It is. I'm sorry, sir, it is.</br></br>


Caller: Oh, okay. Well, there you have it. But anyway, in regards to the COVID-, my COVID experience, you know it's actually overbearing — more so overbearing like during the month of October, November of last year. At the end of November I actually caught it. And I caught it based on the fact I was in a particular housing unit where the canteen workers were also housed.</br></br>


And two weeks prior to the outbreak at that particular-, at this particular facility, well I stayed at that one, because now I moved up or down to the lower yard though it's still considered on the same compound at Mule Creek. The individuals who were assigned to canteen were inmates, were quarantined for 10 days because their boss, whom they were in close contact with, was sick.</br></br>


He was exposed-, was diagnosed with having COVID-19. However, their boss came back, they returned back to work, and then maybe a week later an outbreak occurred in the particular unit that I was at and it started in my unit.</br></br>


I was-. My situation is this. As your brief notification that was received by your organization-, that was sent out by your organization, it's, you know, discussed or required that we discussed the safety that we're now, you know, issued, and not been able to do because of this. Because it's known that staff-, we contracted them at the, excuse me, through staff. Right?</br></br>


I mean we had no other way to get it. And then due to their negligence and their indifference they began to transfer inmates who also, you know, exacerbated the infection rate [unintelligible] the prison inside of California, right? However, even when we consider the unfortunate deaths, as we see on TV now we-, there is no degree of, you know, I want to say, accepting-. Oh, excuse me. A level of comfort I should say in my understanding of their safety.</br></br>


Not only because of that, but when you look at the decision tactics which police and law enforcement agencies use almost in every aspect, you know? You have some level of, you know, grave affect due to their negligence and indifference. As we've seen just yesterday they were finally able to convict somebody from a law enforcement-, of a law enforcement agent based on the, you know, the death that occurred and the acts they committed towards George Floyd, you know?</br></br>


And so, the atmosphere in here, now, is rather sketchy and edgy because we don't know when this-, another outbreak can occur. Because as they are requiring that we wear our masks, they're not always wearing theirs. And so that can create another outbreak, you know? And so, in regards to the area of safety, man. I mean, there's many of us who have some concern in that department for many reasons outside of just a potential COVID infection that may again, you know,` ensue.</br></br>


UCI: Thank you for that, that's understandable. So, how has the vaccination situation been like at the facility? Like, have people been getting vaccinated or how are they distributing?</br></br>


Caller: People have been getting vaccinated and it's unfortunate, too, right? Because most people are utilizing the motivation of getting visits to get the vaccination. And why I say it's unfortunate is because, you know, when you look at the affects of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine per say as of recently then you have, you know, adverse effects, or symptoms, or responses to it, you know? People have as an alternate also, they've lost their lives because of the vaccine.</br></br>


Me, personally, I haven't taken it, yet. Not because I'm so much worried about or have great concern; and therefore, apprehensive due to the short term effects. But the long term effects, especially as an African American male, creates great, you know, opposition within me. I have some great concerns. So, as a population as a whole, people are taking it, but they're taking it-. And I think more so, they're taking it not for the purpose of really curtailing the-, any outbreaks, but for the most part, so then that the system will use a non-vaccination as a reason to deny you of other types of programming, you know?</br></br>


UCI: Mhm, okay.</br></br>


Caller: Yeah, and then watch this. And I'd like to say this: understanding how medication is big money, I would not be surprised if there's some type of financial kick back to CDCR as I am in California, right? Per quota as to the quotas met to be vaccinated, you know? If I'm making any sense with that.</br></br>


UCI: Mhm.</br></br>


Caller: And so, that's even more concern for me because are they really doing it for my well-being. If they were, they would have prevented the outbreak in the first place by being more aggressive in, you know, their employees and being providing PPE in the beginning of this whole thing, you know?</br></br>


UCI: Right. Yeah, I understand.</br></br>


Caller: That's right.</br></br>


UCI: So-.</br></br>


Caller: And I-. Go ahead, I'm sorry.</br></br>


UCI: I was going to ask how has this situation at your facility affected your loved ones?</br></br>


Caller: More so, my observation of other people, because like my loved ones are not really, you know, in that much support of me. I've been incarcerated since '98 and I'm 46 now, so unfortunately, you lose loved ones as your time in incarceration, you know, continues. But in seeing other people's responses, man. It's a bit overwhelming.</br></br>


And you know, to see how as an inmate being in a community these men in here even cry because, you know, at one particular point in time they were not able to see their families. But now, for like the last month in a half, maybe two, there have been video visitations allotted to us. And they have recently opened up to where if people meet certain protocol, again, hence what I said earlier about the non-vaccination, then they can, you know, receive visitors — an hour visit with their loved ones.</br></br>


But that’s-, but look though, I'm like from Los Angeles, California and where I'm presently located is in a city called Ione. Somewhere by Sac-, you are in Irvine, you're in Irvine. So, I mean, if you know California a little bit, you know this is by Sacramento. And so, if you consider the distance that's traveled, who would want to travel from Los Angeles area, or even Orange County, to Sacramento to get an hour visit.</br></br>


So, still there's a great, I want to say, conflict, you know? And hassle, and emotional affect on those who are so positioned, you know?</br></br>


UCI: Oh-.</br></br>


Caller: Yeah, so I mean-. I'm sorry, go ahead.</br></br>


UCI: No, go ahead.</br></br>


Caller: And so, while there is still some level of, you know, sadness and melancholy based on the lack of, you know, physical contact that we can have with people that we know and love us-. CDCR, I can give some credit to them for trying to implement a visitation for prisoners again. So, I mean that's something to look up to.</br></br>


UCI: Okay, so how have you been coping with the crisis, personally?</br></br>


Caller: I'm still dealing with long term effects from COVID and the bad part is since February, there's something called the grievance process. I'm sure you probably know what that is — that's the process necessary to take to you know complain of any institutional issues you may have, whether it's medical or, you know, otherwise.</br></br>


Having submitted one in February they had until March 26 to respond to me because I've been having a throat issue that has been, you know, sick and great discomfort upon me because it affects my voice, it's affecting my breathing, and it's affecting my eating process, and I'm-. I expressed this on the grievance-, haven't even told doctors about this. and whether they're even doing any further testing, there-, I would see a doctor, though they have not yet responded to the grievance, which was dated March 26, within itself is an unconstitutional response.</br></br>


However, even in seeing doctors based in when we put in medical request forms to be seen by doctors issued there, associating it to or relating it to, you know, long term COVID affects. Okay, fine. But still do something to, you know, make-, diagnose me, diagnose what the issue may be, right?</br></br>


I mean you can do something beyond just looking through my throat with a light. You can, you know, order me-, order a doctor for me then I wouldn't go that far. But, unfortunately, that even creates irritation because they're saying their hands are tied because they don't want to do any outside transfers to any hospitals.</br></br>


And so, you know, medically, man. It goes back to the whole issue about safety. I mean, you can't even feel safe in the hands of the doctors because, you know, they're manipulating this COVID situation to, ultimately, I believe it's to save funds.</br></br>


UCI: Mhm.</br></br>


Caller: You know? And when you look at, you know, prison, it's big business. You know? And it's not about, you know, the lives of human-, humanity or human beings, it's about the money you can make-, they can make behind it. That's the reason why the overcrowding occurred. And now they have to be smart of that based on, you know, federal issues that have ensued due to, you know, lawsuits.</br></br>


UCI: Mhm.</br></br>


Caller: Most definitely.</br></br>


UCI: Well-.</br></br>


Caller: Uhm.</br></br>


UCI: I'm sorry?</br></br>


Caller: No go ahead. You, go ahead.</br></br>


UCI: I was telling you like I really enjoyed speaking with you today, sir. Now, thank you very much for participating in the PrisonPandemic. Please consider telling your friends about us and if they would like to call in at any time.</br></br>


Caller: Okay, then I will most definitely spread the word. And, also, I expressed in the letter that I had already composed that if there's any student willing to communicate — I can always use a friend.</br></br>


UCI: Yes, sir.</br></br>


Caller: I'm in Mule Creek, NCIC, you'll be getting letters from me in the next week or so. If I could say my name, I would, but expressing to you how I have, if you got the letters, you probably know all that stuff.</br></br>


UCI: Yes, sir.</br></br>


Caller: But anybody that you might know would be willing to communicate, man, I would love to have the opportunity to do so. I'm also in college presently, too. So, I'm gonna get my Behavioral Science, you know my [unintelligible] and area whatnot. But I'm pursuing-, starting a nonprofit I wanna get started, so I would love to communicate with a student.</br></br>


UCI: Mhm, no problem. Please feel free to reach out to us. Anytime.</br></br>


Caller: Oh, and I have, man. I have. God bless you, now [redacted].</br></br>


UCI: God bless you, also.</br></br>


Caller: Alright, man.
