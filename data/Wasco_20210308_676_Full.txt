Dear Jess,
<br><br>
Thank you for the kindly worded letter I received from the Prison Pandemic Project. Although it was highly unexpected, it is truly appreciated. Before I begin sharing my experiences regarding the effects and affect of the COVID pandemic on us inside, I want to preface this by stating that I am an innocent man still fighting a case for a crime I never committed. As such, the COVID pandemic has also had an adverse effect on my appeal as well. With that said, here goes my story:
<br><br>
I arrived at the Wasco State Prison Reception Center in February of 2020. Yes, you read that correctly, just a little more than 1 year ago. The prison, at the time, had just come off a quarantine period due to an outbreak of the mumps and inmates were just beginning to be transferred to the mainline prisons where they would be serving the remainder of their sentences.
<br><br>
At the time, the standard period of time that an inmate would expect to remain at any of the CDCR Reception Centers was a period of 4 months. It would take up to 90 days for the correctional counselor to come see you, and approximately 30 more days to get transferred. Depending on an inmate's placement score, he may be housed in a cell block or a dorm. Most low level offenders are housed in dorms, where we are forced to live in close quarters with hundreds (literally about 200 inmates) of other inmates. 
<br><br>
When the COVID pandemic hit California, I was only 1 month into my time here at Wasco. We were each allowed 1 phone call a month and only no contact visits or visits through glass were allowed. Wasco State Prison Reception Center was not yet set up for video visits. Therefore, being that I also am not a resident of California, I had no visits unless my family were to fly in from Texas in order to see me through glass for 1 hour and then have to fly back home. I have not laid eyes on my wife and kids since January 5th, 2020 when I went to San Jose, CA to go to trial. 
<br><br>
In April of 2020, COVID-19 broke out in the California prison system and we were locked down, effective immediately. One would have hoped that an organization such as the CDCR would have had some type of contingency plan for the pandemic, especially given the close quarters in which we are housed. Not the case. Not the case at all. From the beginning, it was understood by the inmate population here at Wasco that the risk was posed to us by the C.O’s and prison staff, given that they all get to leave the prison grounds on a daily basis, and are in constant contact with the public.
<br><br>
This created a potential for exposure to the virus, and then are allowed to come to work at the prison and bring it on to us. Prison staff and C.O’s walked around the prison grounds for months, even after it became mandated to wear them, without masks, continuously exposing us to the virus. In many cases, I overheard C.O’s discussing not reporting symptoms so they wouldn't be sent home and have to use their sick leave. Instead, they stated they would rather test positive at work and be sent home on paid leave for the balance of the 14 day incubation period, from the day they tested positive. 
<br><br>
In other words, if they got tested today, and got a positive result 5 days from now, they would then have 9 days paid leave at home to recover. Downright scandalous. On top of all these things, we found ourselves stuck and reception with no way to program or earn our milestones in order to earn time off of our sentences. Had COVID not hit, I would have realistically been released around Christmas time last year. Once the rest of the state shut down, I realized that my appeal would end up getting pushed back, possibly even after I was released in 2021. As it currently stands, my appellate lawyer has yet to receive the complete record for my case, and is on standby to go to the opening brief. I will be released next month upon the completion of my sentence and will most likely still be waiting for my appeal to move forward, after the fact. 
<br><br>
I realize this story keeps jumping back and forth, for that I apologize and hope that you can make sense of it as you read along. In early May of 2020, Wasco State Prison Reception Center began attempting to create space to socially distance ourselves, and began to reduce the head count in the dorms by moving many of us to the cell blocks. As a result, I spent the next 8 months in a cell vs. a dorm. 
<br><br>
During this time I began to experience severe pain in my left kidney. I ended up going man down because I couldn't take the pain. I was subsequently diagnosed with a 9 by 6mm kidney stone that was obstructing the ureter in my kidney. On the outside, during normal conditions, I would have had the surgery or surgeries required to remove the stone in a period of 2-4 weeks. Being that I’m in prison and in the middle of a pandemic, I had to endure the stone for another 3 months with a ureteral stent before I was finally able to have a laser lithotripsy performed and the stone removed.
<br><br>
Needless to say, the amount of pain I had to endure was nothing short of inhumane, especially since we are not allowed to have any prescription pain medications in here beyond 3 days. Otherwise it’s Naproxen or Ibuprofen. Fast forward a few months to November of 2020, and I was brought back to the dorms in the yard I was originally housed in. We were told then by the staff that all inmates housed in my respective dorm would be transferred to our mainline prisons within 30 days. In my mind, I'm thinking finally well, life is not without a certain sense of irony. 
<br><br>
When the pandemic first hit, I had been endorsed to the San Quentin State Prison. After 180 days, my endorsement to SQSP expired and I was subsequently re-endorsed to the Corcoran Substance Abuse Training facility. So to me, the comment that we would be transferred within 30 days made sense. As I previously stated, life it seems is not without a sense of irony. 30 days later, I was transferred back to the cell blocks and on December 13th, 2020, I was informed that I had contracted COVID-19. 
<br><br>
I would remain in quarantine for the next 21 days. I won't embellish or hyperbolize what my experience was like, but I will say this much. It was like the worst case of the flu I've ever had. Even now, I still have lingering effects such as the random nose bleeds I get from time to time which I never had before COVID. On January 3rd, 2021, I was moved back into the dorms and out of the cell blocks. I have been waiting to be transferred to a mainline ever since. 
<br><br>
On February 19th, 2021, I was finally told I would be moving to the Corcoran Substance Abuse Training Facility in Corcoran, CA. This was on a Friday. So, I packed all of my belongings and began to hope again that I’d be released just a little sooner than my current release date of April 20th, 2021. Keep in mind, this is a full 90 days after having been initially told I’d be out of here within 30 days. On Monday, Feb 22, 2021, my scheduled date of departure, I got to see all other inmates that were slated for transfer go to their new institutions. 
<br><br>
I was left behind, only to be informed an hour late, that I had been scratched and wouldn't be going anywhere just yet. I am now 46 days out from my release date and am still here at the Wasco State Prison Reception Center and will most likely be released well in advance of my appeal. I've mentioned all this to give you my own personal account of what I've gone through during my time here. Now, I feel I should explain what the conditions that all of my fellow inmates and I have had to endure together are. 
<br><br>
For starters the CDCR government website is boasting about how each inmate has been provided with hand sanitizer and additional cleaning supplies. This is a blatant lie. We have received the very same bar of state soap a week that we were getting before the pandemic. We have been provided with no additional supplies during the pandemic. Initially, we were provided with 2 masks per inmate, which were also being exchanged every 3rd day to ensure we were wearing clean masks. Well, that fell by the wayside very quickly and now we have zero mask exchanges going on at all. 
<br><br>
Additionally, it was also mandated that every inmate have 3 masks, which were initially distributed only to have any spare masks turned back in. Most of us here only have one mask anymore. It’s extremely frustrating to us all that the CDCR has not been held accountable for their negligent behavior. The prison is filthy. Restrooms and showers are constantly broken or out of service. It’s overcrowded and social distancing is a joke. C.O’s continue to walk around without a mask, but will write us up for doing the same. 
<br><br>
Every time an audit team comes in, the prison is given advance notice, and suddenly maintenance personnel appears to begin fixing things. They last long enough to survive the audit, but no more than that. Inmate porters are then told to clean the hell out of everything and suddenly all the good cleaning supplies are made available to them, and almost as if by magic, the C.O’s are wearing masks and gloves at all times. Until auditors and inspectors are allowed warrantless entry unto, through, and upon prison advanced notice of inspection, nothing will change on the inside. 
<br><br>
Its smoke and mirrors, lipstick on a pig. The prison is cleaned up just enough to pass minimalist inspections and is never allowed to be seen candidly the way we get to live it each and every day. I hope this letter and personal account helps to open the eyes of those who can truly affect the change that is needed in this and all other prisons throughout the States. My sincerest hopes are that many more inmates are able to speak on these issues freely as well.
<br><br>
Best regards,
