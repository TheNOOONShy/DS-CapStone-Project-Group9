This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Calipatria.</br></br>

So, yeah, it's bad due to not being able to see my wife [redacted], my only sister [redacted], my mom who's 73 now and has many illnesses. And just yesterday I called my wife to find out my dad who's 75 is in the hospital. And so all day yesterday I’ve been crying for him, and just being sad, because I know how he feels.</br></br> 

It’s been 21 years the last time I physically saw him. I saw my mom up in High Desert along with my sister before this crazy pandemic.</br></br> 

So where’s Sunland? I’ve never heard of that city. I thought UCI was in Irvine. That goes to show how long we been gone out of society. It's cool. I deserved to be punished and taken off the streets. I broke the law for being desperate for money to pay rent, car payment, bills.</br></br> 

When I was fired from my last job as a tow truck driver at AC Towing in San Clemente. Figures everyone hates tow truck drivers like they hate lawyers. Ha ha. Why is that? Anyways.</br></br>

I’m coping with this by reading the Bible and just by faith, love, and being positive. If not it would have killed me years ago. I just turned 50 Christmas Eve. So it's a miracle. GOD is carrying me. I’m not sure if you believe in him or her, they say we're made from his image. Who knows. It's a complicated book.</br></br> 

So yeah you can use my story, for historical purposes. They don’t have to be anonymous. It's no secret I'm in here. So, yeah, whatever you need, I'll be 100% with you. So far the prison reform has been going good. This new president is more down to earth, unlike Trump who is out of this world, crazy. It would of started a riot-incited it, by my words, and five or even one person was killed I’ll be charged with murder 187, no bull.</br></br> 

I knew the guy who started the riot in Pelican Bay in 2000 on B-Yard where the guards just shot and killed a guy. He was charged with that, was given a life sentence. Then he was SHU-Segregated Housing Unit, and hang himself. So, yeah, there’s a double standard when it comes to the law.
