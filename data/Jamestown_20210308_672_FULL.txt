You sound like an intuitive individual, and caring, and likely a humanitarian. Wondering at how things would be in this present social tragedy for our youths, those in the free world and those in prisons.</br></br>

You’re right to think that the effects of the same cause are devastating in prisons too. I’ve attempted to convey the extreme dangers to us here at Sierra Conservation Center, but they fell on deaf ears.</br></br>

After reading the Erik Von Steich case from San Quentin’s tragedy, I began to compare the similarities of dangers in our prisons, to those expressed to the courts by Steich, in San Quentin.</br></br>

For example, one, the cells in San Quentin were said to be so small that you could touch both walls by stretching your arms. In our confinement conditions, 32 inmates could stretch their arms and touch their neighbors’ elbows!</br></br>

Two, imagine these 32 inmates trying to watch TV in a space one fifth that of the bedding areas.</br></br>

Three, ventilation in San Quentin, was said to be poor ours was non-existent, aside from opening windows. Further, there have been new ventilation systems here on the facility’s roof for more than five years, and are still there! Even when ventilation was so being scrutinized by the so-called auditors of safety.</br></br>

Four, CDCR will tell you that they care so much about inmates communicating with their families. But here, even in the extreme circumstances, the phones that have been promised to be installed since before the pandemic, are still in warehouses. So, 12 phones for 1,200 inmates is the reality of our first amendment privilege here.</br></br>

Further, the phone privileges are handled by inmates, so much of the time, extortion is practiced to get on the phone. Give me some money, and you might get a call, my homie is first though.</br></br>

Still further, our tier has 16 dorms with about 512 inmates when as packed as they’d like to be it. And when yard is released all of us go running to the single phone list on a eight by 12 piece of paper on the wall. Doesn’t that sound pretty damn dangerous?</br></br>

There is no recreational equipment in order to be safe but the area around the phone list is just fine the way it is. I could play an unheard of 20 on 20 game of basketball and it would be safer than making a phone call, or checking for my name on the phone list! Imagine the soccer field, it’s easily an area 100 times the size of a dormitory, with less people on it while playing, but safety matters then?</br></br>

I’ll share with you some of the injuries from the simple deprivation. My cholesterol level has risen 30 points and I’ve gained nearly the same amount of pounds! My only outlet for stress, anger, and exercise, has been stripped from me, on a false pretense, that CDCR cares about my well being.</br></br>

The absurdities continue, correctional officers did not wear their facial coverings for nearly all of the pandemic’s year long time frame! Neither would their employees enforce that they did. I filed a grievance about it, and guess what I was told.</br></br>

I was told that the sergeant for third watch, that he was not going to investigate his officers. But he would investigate the cameras to see if I wore mine, along with the other inmates!</br></br>

I wrote the warden to inform him of our eighth amendment right to safety was being violated by his officers not wearing their masks while performing their duties. Like always he lied in his answer to me that all SCC staff were wearing their masks. Then some 60 days later, I got an answer from the appeals office about my grievance, and it said that grieving about staff wearing masks, was outside the scope of their grievance process!</br></br>

One day, 30 some odd inmates were brought to this facility on my yard, from fire camp, who were COVID-19 positive. This is prison, and everyone here knows that when fire campers show up from camp, they may have smuggled drugs or tobacco too! Those dorms were not quarantined they were just housed in a dorm by themselves.</br></br>

Everyone had access to them, and what inmate has no drug addiction problems? Staff allowed for them to be accessed and the beginning of history was going to be made.</br></br>

The virus spread like crazy, and on 12-6-20, a program status report was distributed to the inmates. It told us what the count was of positive COVID-19 cases, what dorms were quarantined and when they were quarantined.</br></br>

On 12-6-20, four inmates were moved into dorm 69 where I was housed, from dorms 51 and 53. Those four inmates would make the count in out dorm-32 of 32, full capacity. Not only would they expose inmates to the virus, but they would expose as many as possible. Four days later, every person was positive for COVID-19. </br></br>

The program status sheet made staff aware of the fact those inmates were housed in a quarantined dorm for only nine days.</br></br>

Our entire dorm knew it too, and we watched inmates from 51 and 53 all day long get hauled off in wheelchairs with COVID-19. So when they came to our dorm door, we laid down in front of the dorm’s door to non-violently protest and orally grieve the dangerous moves being made that would subject us to a seriously communicable disease.</br></br>

Third watch ordered the exposed inmates to step over our bodies. And one youngster stood up so as not to be stepped over, and was thrown down to the ground and cuffed up and told he would be getting a shu term. The rest of us were threatened that if we prevented the exposed inmates from entering the dorms, we would be sent to a general population yard.</br></br>

To understand the severity of that threat, I must explain to you the changes made on lower yards like this one. This yard consists of half protective custody inmates and half general population inmates. And is referred to as a non-designated program yard/facility (NDPF).</br></br>

As far as the higher level inmates are concerned, all NDPF inmates are protective custody, and will be attacked violently and ruthlessly. General population inmates are found in the higher levels of prison where they would rather die than live with a protective custody inmate, or kill!</br></br>

Needless to say, the threat of an adverse action like being sent to where we would be killed, effectively chilled our non-violent oral grievance, and the first amendment says we can make freely. Four days later we were all COVID-19 positive!</br></br>

The moves that had been made on 12-15-20 were not only moves made that would expose inmates to the seriously communicable disease of COVID-19. We were locked down completely and the entire yard somehow got infected with COVID-19. Blame it on the wind, rain, and everything else, but I know that we were part of an illegal herd immunity experiment. And prison officials deliberately exposed us COVID-19.</br></br>

So, you’re like this ear descending from heaven. Into the small, overcrowded confines of chaos, misery, solitude and never-ending fear, anxiety, and danger. Listening to the forgotten, meaningless, and deemed lost, and worthless souls’ tales of the pandemic terror in prison.</br></br>

The stripping of family contact, personal safety, and the realization of it only being a formality selectively applied to deprive, but never really protecting, or fulfilling a constitutionally protected right to safety and health.</br></br>

To answer some of your other questions, think or imagine a world filled with violence, tension, ignorance, and masses in it. Mostly having a fixed or victim mindset. Except for those who’ve already learned how to change, who consequently are aged and very useful to the younger social networks, but who are at risk of death from COVID-19.</br></br>

The only people who have insight on how to change are the only people who you want to talk to. So they can share their nuggets of knowledge on how to do so. But there is no one who cares for their well-being, who has the power to make safety precautions and healthcare advice a reality in our social network.</br></br>

Please let it be known, that the resulting death of an inmate named [redacted], was from the way moves were made, and the way Sierra Conservation Center managed the COVID-19 pandemic in this California prison. He died two days after being paroled, following decades of incarceration. The prison claimed zero deaths of the thousands who were found to be positive for COVID.</br></br>

If you need me to delve further into any other aspect, I will. I will just get lost in the injustices in prison, and this was a big one!</br></br>

I could go further into the classes I’ve been taking in college, and I think I sense a hint of sociology in your endeavor here. Maybe we could talk about reasons for recidivism rates in California prisons, or anything you’d like. I love writing, but I’m better if the subject is a little more specific. One topic at a time.
