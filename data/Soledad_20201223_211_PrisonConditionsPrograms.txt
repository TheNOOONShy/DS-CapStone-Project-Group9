Hey PrisonPandemic,</br></br>

I like to share an update, of which I became aware of today. Finally made it to the yard after about 18 days and to my amazement, CTF has constructed, I believe there were six tents, small in comparison to the big top at the circus.</br></br>

With social distancing in mind, they may accomodate about 60 people total. Its suppose to isolate the infection person outside of the housing units. Is that going to make a difference, time will tell. It should be noted that the inmates are being infected by the staff.</br></br>

Anyway, today was a shock. A large portion of the exercise yard has been compromised, plus, I only got approximately 45 min. of outdoor time. It was a waste of effort. I don't use the phone as I don't see that they are properly sanitized. That's the latest around here, SNAFU!!!!</br></br>

I'm just praying to get out of this cesspool before the judge sticks and I get dragged to the bottom. There's a whole new danger to being in prison first TB, then, Valley Fever now COVID-19. There's close to 10 who've gone down on this facility alone. Do what you can for us. Good cheer. I believe in God so, I say God is Good.</br></br>

Peace out.
