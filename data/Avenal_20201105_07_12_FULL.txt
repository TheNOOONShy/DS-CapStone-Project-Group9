This story was told by a person incarcerated at Avenal.</br></br>

UCI: One of the questions is: What facility are you currently housed at?</br></br>Caller: Avenal State Prison.</br></br>UCI: And what is the current COVID-19 situation at your facility? What is going okay?</br></br>Caller: What is it like?</br></br>UCI: Yeah.</br></br>Caller: I guess the - right now everybody's wearing a N95 mask. They're trying to do social distancing, but Avenal State Prison is one of the few prisons in California that are dorm living.</br></br>So social distancing is - is pretty impossible, you know?</br></br>UCI: What do you think is going okay at your - your facility?</br></br>Caller: They got the building separated. You only go out to yard about an hour and a half with your own building.</br></br>So you don't have contact with the - all the other buildings, which I think is okay. Makes sense.</br></br>You know some of the other buildings you have positive - positive inmates.</br></br>UCI: And then what is troubling or concerning you?</br></br>Caller: I would have to say that in my opinion, there's only one way we're - we could get COVID-19 after being, I guess you could say, separated from society or family or loved ones for - what is this - it's beginning of March this year, and that's the staff who gets to go home every day and come back, go out, come back, go out, come back.</br></br>And I guess that's what a lot of people who tested negative were afraid about is them coming out positive, and that's the only way people come out positive is, like I said, we can't go home every day, you know?</br></br>UCI: Right.</br></br>Caller: Somebody's bringing it in and it's not us.</br></br>UCI: Yeah. And how was COVID-19 handled by your facility at the beginning of the outbreak?</br></br>Caller: Oh, at the beginning I don't even think they knew what to do.</br></br>It was a - they tested everybody, and I would have to say 75 percent of the place - of our yard - because there's six yards here - I would say 75 percent of this yard came out positive, but the remaining population who tested negative, they were still all around the positives. They weren't separating them or nothing, which to me didn't make sense at all, so - and now all these negatives are slowly but surely testing positive.</br></br>And as soon as they test positive, then they remove them and separate them, which again, to, I guess, to anybody with sense does not make sense, you know?</br></br>UCI: Right. And is it being handled differently now, do you think?</br></br>Caller: I think now it's a majority of people are already tested positive, so even some of the guys tested negative initially, they're coming up positive.</br></br>So now whenever they test positive, it's easier for them to remove them because they're the minorities now. And they seclude them for, I think 14 days or 15 days, quarantine them, then they bring them back to the same place where they were housed at the open setting, open dorms. So it's not like you're secluded behind a door like Pelican Bay, Pleasant Valley, or Corcoran or Folsom, there's no cells, you know?</br></br>It's like a - like a homeless shelter, if you've ever visited one before.</br></br>UCI: Can you please tell us month-by-month how the situation has changed at your facility? Like do you think it's progressively getting better or?</br></br> Caller: Not better. I think everybody is just slowly by surely coming out positive. I don't know if that's what they're aiming for so we could just get it over with and resume normal program, what they call it here. But they - pretty social distancing. For example, in a dorm there's 12 - 12 beds. So that would be six bunk beds.</br></br>So to create social distancing, they told the people in the middle bunks, so they would, like, leave a middle open so the people on the left and the right, there would only be bunks. But then again, you still have bunkees, so there's no social distancing there. So they remove those people from the middle bunks and rehouse them all over Avenal State Prison.</br></br>They threw some people inside the gym where they used to play basketball and ping pong and exercise activities. They threw - they threw, like, I would not even call them bunks. Like cots, you know? They threw cots in there and filled the gyms up with people. I don't know. And again, the positives, they removed them and took them to a specific building until 14 or 15 days pass, and then they brought them back.</br></br>And there was - and took the day just constant movement everywhere, you know? For example, if one of my dormees would become out positive right now, because still negative since March, they would not only remove him but everybody around has to be put on quarantine, even though most of us have already been - came out positive back in March.</br></br>Separate us, I don't know.</br></br>

Make sense to É</br></br>No, I was just saying I don't know, but some days that doesn't make sense.</br></br>UCI: What would make the situation at your facility better do you think?</br></br>Caller: Let me see. What would make it better? I feel even though I tested positive back in March, I think the - the small population of people who came out negative since March, they're still being tested every weekly and they still coming out negative, yet they're still housed around those of us and have been housed around all of us since March.</br></br>I think it would be better for - to separate them maybe, you know? So they -</br></br> UCI: Yeah.</br></br>Caller: - won't catch it.</br></br>UCI: Yeah.</br></br>Caller: But I think that would be best for them. Because for us, I mean, we -</br></br> For us, we already came out positive and there's not much we could do, you know?</br></br>UCI: How has the COVID-19 situation affected your loved ones?</br></br>Caller: Me personally, I mean, I just had a son before this COVID-19 happened and I haven't seen him.</br></br>
Like my last visit was the end of February.</br></br>UCI: Mm-hmm.</br></br>Caller: I haven't had visits from my loved ones, my son. Even though I get to talk to him on the phone, you know, almost daily. But I think him growing up, because he just turned two, but I haven't seen him since March.</br></br>I think that's the hardest part for me and for them. And who knows when they're going to restart visits again because, you know, we hear different rumors here and there, but nothing -</br></br> UCI: Yeah. Yeah. That's really hard. I'm sorry to hear that.</br></br>Caller: Oh, that's okay.</br></br>UCI: And what has it been like for you to have reduced visitations and programming?</br></br>Caller: Like I say, I get pictures, phone calls, and things like that, but not being able hug your -</br></br>UCI: See them?</br></br>Caller: - that's pretty difficult; you know?</br></br>UCI: How have you been coping with the crisis, like how you're coping with this whole issue?</br></br>Caller: Myself, I'm enrolled in college, so I try to read and do coursework as much as I can and try to - so far I haven't failed a class; you know?</br></br>So thankfully they're - they're still letting us go through correspondence college courses and they go through your - your groups that are necessary for you to better yourself, so I think that's the way most of us have been coping in here.</br></br>UCI: That's good. That's good. There's still programs available for you guys?</br></br>Caller: Yeah. The sponsors don't come in from the - from them cities outside more because of the pandemic, but amongst ourselves we still hold, you know, self-help groups and attend them, you know, try to keep it as legit and professional as we could;, you know?</br></br>UCI: One question: What else do you want people to know about your experience?</br></br>Caller: Not really. Not really much. Not much. Just - just wanted to share. I mean, if you had questions, I would ask. I didn't know what this was really, you know, so I just gave it a try.</br></br>UCI: No, I just want to say thank you so much for participating with us. It really means a lot to us to be able to interview you and for you to tell us about your experience.</br></br>Caller: All right. Thank you. I appreciate it.</br></br>UCI: Thank you. Bye.</br></br>Caller: Bye-bye.
