This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Sonoma County Main Adult Detention Facility.</br></br>

The Main Adult Detention Facility of Sonoma County has not been following the proper procedures that have been implemented by the public health and safety to prevent COVID-19 from entering and spreading through the facility.</br></br>

Therefore, may cause us inmates that have been incarcerated for months or even years to be infected by this viral and contagious disease. Many sentenced and un-sentenced inmates housed in this module, such as I, have been put to work in the kitchen voluntarily or involuntarily.</br></br>

From paying attention to the news on a daily basis, I know that we are to wear our masks at all times except for when eating or drinking. We are to wash our hands or sanitize them after use of the restrooms, practice six feet social distancing and etc. And yet, these aren’t practiced well enough. Nine to 15 of us kitchen workers have to eat in a 10 by 15 feet break room.</br></br>

When serving the units food, we serve them on rubber trays that are returned to us to clean after use. These trays and carts that we send them on aren’t labeled by quarantine mods or not. We have been told by few staff members that there is a quarantine mod where people go through the 14-day COVID screening, but some of the staff has told us there isn’t one or they have no knowledge of it.</br></br>

We are being told false information to dissuade us from the truth. If there is a quarantine mod, as there should be, then people who could possibly have COVID-19 are eating off the trays that are being returned to us un-sanitized or not bleached.</br></br>

A contagious virus such as COVID-19 needs H2O to duplicate its gene, which in turn, creates enormous amounts of virus that infects people. COVID-19 is not only a liquid contagious disease but also can go airborne.</br></br>

So if someone were to spit, pee, defecate, sneeze, bleed on a tray or eat off the spoons–– which we send to certain mods, only to receive when done–– has COVID-19, then we are unfortunately vulnerable to inhaling the pathogens into our body systems.</br></br> 

They tell us everyday that they are following the correct procedures but it doesn’t seem so.</br></br>

Our mods are packed to near full with people. People are celled up with others without the knowledge if the person is COVID-19 negative. Even us kitchen workers could have caught COVID-19 from the kitchen, only to bring it back to the housing unit and possibly spreading it. Due to the fact that we aren’t tested on a daily basis, weekly basis or even a bi-weekly basis.
