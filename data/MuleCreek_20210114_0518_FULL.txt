This story was told by a person incarcerated at Mule Creek.</br></br>
UCI: So what is the current COVID-19 situation at your facility? Is it going okay? Is there anything troubling or concerning to you?</br></br>Caller: It's, it started smoothing itself out. They’re trying to figure out what to do, but, that was just as of last week, considering they started around Thanksgiving.</br></br>UCI: Oh.</br></br>Caller: So what’s troubling is, they were locking people in the gyms with terrible conditions, unsafe environment. Asking people to constantly move while they’re sick, grabbing their property, going to different gyms, relocating. I think possibly, I was, I know I was relocated four times in the two weeks of the recommended quarantine.</br></br>UCI: Mhm.</br></br>Caller: You don’t rest, you don’t get cleaning supplies. It was just a big mess. Temperature check was kind of a joke because you get asymptomatic people, it didn’t matter. People weren’t getting their results back. People were actually negative that had results, they were still housed in the gym with the positive people who tested positive. It was all around horrible.</br></br>UCI: I see. So, were they not providing, like, masks or letting prisoners do social distancing of six feet, so they weren’t following protocol?</br></br>Caller: Okay so, the six feet social distancing was violated in Facility A, B, and C gyms. Those gyms originally had single-man cots, and they were removed, and they put in bunks, double bunks for two people to be housed on, and they took the social distancing sign off the top bunk and then used them. It said, “do not use for social distancing purposes,” but they stashed those signs down and doubled us up in facilities A, B, and C.</br></br>UCI: I see.</br></br>Caller: Approximately 80 to 100 people at one time.</br></br>UCI: And, so, how they handled it, or how you just described, was that happening throughout? Like, so, did that start in March or did that kind of like, just occur as-</br></br>UCI: Sorry.</br></br>Caller: It started approximately the week of Thanksgiving, in between like, November 22nd and 26th.</br></br>UCI: So would you say at the beginning it was being handled, like, well, or how was it different from the beginning of Thanksgiving?</br></br>Caller: Disgustingly poorly. We were considered luggage and storage in the beginning. There were separating us from our property, giving us false instructions, saying that we were going to move back to our spots in two weeks.</br></br> 

We ended up getting in a row, like a journey challenge, gym to gym, going through different conditions. Half the backs were laundry exchange, we only got laundry exchange once in that whole time. Facility B gym had no air, consistent hot water, which was, they let the steam go kind of, you know, circulation, no ventilation whatsoever.</br></br> 

Then you go to Facility C, which was extremely cold, fans blasting, I mean we’re talking about 50 degrees in there, no hot water, so, and no clean spots. Once again, the A and B gyms. I never did experience the Facility D and E gyms, but I know the people who experienced it that were locked in overnight, and on hourly unlock.</br></br> 

It was hard for them to use the bathroom, some of them were actually urinating in empty Pedialyte bottles over trashcans because they couldn’t hold it.</br></br> UCI: I see.</br></br>Caller: Officers continue to try to blame medical, but I mean, because they had to take some part in something, just being civilized.</br></br>UCI: So, what would make the situation at your facility better? Is there anything that you guys particularly need? Is it just more attention to what’s going on, or should there be like better resources?</br></br>Caller: Well, there’s nothing better. The only thing that’s better about it is its almost over. Like, there, almost everybody caught it. They report the numbers consistently wrong all the time.</br></br> 

But those who keep testing negative, they’re putting them in situations to catch it, or taking away their programs. Because they're saying that we’re high risk, and they're trying to keep them safe, but you can’t keep them safe if you just lock them away and say they can’t have a program until they catch it.</br></br> 

So, it’s like you’re punished for being—for not catching it, you're being punished for catching it. They won’t allow them to have video visits because of it. It’s just ridiculous here. It’s not well planned out. They failed.</br></br>UCI: So, is there anything that would make the situation better? To, like, I would say, improve the situation there?</br></br>Caller: Well, the program- the vaccine of course would need to roll out sooner, because right now staff is taking it. But, people who further along in the future, who test positive, they need to lock those cells down instead of them moving in to other locations, which cause possible spread to others.</br></br> UCI: I see. And, so how has the COVID-19 situation at your facility affected your loved ones? Are you still able to see people or has that been cut off since, like, March?</br></br>Caller: Well, it was, I was in the first group, so everything was rough then. I still had access to a phone to talk to my loved ones, and things of that nature. But for a lot of others, because my situation is a little different, you know, depending, considering my job here.</br></br>UCI: Mhm.</br></br>Caller: But for a lot of others, no, it was very hard for them. Especially in the beginning, when mail was not existent, and mail was still behind based on holidays, but they didn’t want to touch our mail, they said due to COVID, they didn’t want to exchange mail or pick up mail. So yeah, it was a big deal, like, in the beginning it was difficult.</br></br>UCI: I see, so, how have you been coping with the crisis, with everything that’s been going on?</br></br>Caller: Me? The sickness was hard because of the consistent moving without resting. And this is actually our second time having it, they didn’t report it the first time earlier this year, because they didn’t know what it was.</br></br> 

But, this is not our first time going—our first go around with it. This is the first time the institution, they finally admitted it.</br></br> 

So, we kind of were familiar with what was going on, considering what happened earlier around this time last year. So, it’s dealing with, it was easier to deal with because I knew what to expect, but it was just rough because the sickness is so hard on your body. And all you got was diarrhea medicine and cold packs and Pedialyte and Gatorade. It’s nowhere near solving anything. It calms symptoms down but, you're sick.</br></br>UCI: I see. So, when you refer to the second round, is that, like, corona cases surging at your facility?</br></br>Caller: Yes. Because this time last year, you had, approximately four buildings were quarantined, and staff was calling in very sick, and the same symptoms, the muscle aches, the whole paper they give you, the whole symptoms they run to you.</br></br> 

I actually took a flu test and passed and tested negative for both strands, so we were trying to figure out what we had. And everybody figured it out later on. Administration was starting to admit it slowly but surely, that yeah, they believe it swept through here.</br></br> 

But then, there were no reports, the infectious disease nurse didn’t have any answers, and, yeah, we muscled through it before. So, everybody knew what it was the second time.</br></br>UCI: Oh?</br></br>Caller: Yeah, oh yeah.</br></br>UCI: So, these calls are only 15 minutes long in nature, and we just approached the 10-minute mark, so I just wanted to ask you if you wanted to let anyone, or let people know about anything else that’s been going on or any other things you want to mention or bring up?</br></br>Caller: Yes. Medical administration needs to really need be looked into in Mule Creek State Prison, and they falsified the numbers on the computer, it was almost double the amount every time they reported numbers as far as having people were, had contracted it. So they falsified the numbers.</br></br>UCI: I see. And, aside from that, is that all that you wanted to share for today, or is there anything else you’d like to highlight or bring up?</br></br>Caller: As far as today, they did, they sent all doctors to the gyms where people were housed and gave them blanket false stories of how you can and can’t test and the symptoms, and things of that nature, didn’t match up.</br></br> 

They said you couldn’t test positive for 90 days straight, but in fact, staff had to get two negatives within 10 to 14 days to come back to work, and they were able to do so, so we were trying to figure out how we were different from staff when we’re both humans. It was just a lot of lies.</br></br>UCI: I see. Okay so, the call is about to end soon, is there anything else you would want to share about your experience?</br></br>Caller: As far as my experience, I would like to let them know that most of the officers here did support us, and they did urge the appeal, but I expect—I really believe all the families should try and check with their loved ones and report it to the highest authority they can, inspector generals, state auditors, and so forth.</br></br>UCI: Thank you so much. And just one more time, just to make sure that I am able to capture your story, is there anything else you want us to know about your experience? If not, it’s totally okay, just so you know.</br></br>Caller: No, that’s pretty much it. It was just horrible. It was really horrible.</br></br>UCI: I see. Well, thank you very much.
