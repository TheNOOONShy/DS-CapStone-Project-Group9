I and others deeply accepted the thought that the whole COVID-19 was a hoax. Lo and behold, it turned out to be the real Frankenstein, the Grim Reaper. Our programs were limited and adversely shutdown in April 2020. Visiting came to a complete halt. People on my left and people on my right tested positive for COVID-19. They were separated and quarantined. It went on and on without an end in sight. There were no demises here as far as I recollect. I could be wrong.</br></br>

There were 800 inmates on this yard. Now, there are only 299 inmates. 500 inmates paroled or were early released because COVID-19 expedited it. Some people in prison maybe should not have been in prison in the first place so they were lucky to leave prison early. Prison is a hell.</br></br> 

I was in college working on my eighth degree (AIA). When COVID-19 shut down our college program in person. The community college converted or switched to distance learning. We kept on trucking. I was able to obtain my AIA sociology. I should have 15 AIA degrees by February 2020. I have completed the work at Cerro Coso College fall semester 2020.</br></br>

I feel there is no way they can advocate or practice six feet social distance in prison because it is not humanly possible. We were issued two orange masks made of jacket cloth by the PIA. I wash them daily. Itâ€™s mandatory that we wear them at all times except in your living area.</br></br>

I think it was a smart thing for the prison to stop all visits because it saved lives, I know.
