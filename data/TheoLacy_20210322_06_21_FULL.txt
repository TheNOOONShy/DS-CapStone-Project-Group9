This story was told by a person incarcerated at Theo Lacy.</br></br>

UCI: Perfect. Okay. So, the time is now 6:20PM, March 22. So, what facility are you at?</br></br>

Caller: I’m currently at the Theo. Sorry, I’m at the TheoLacy facility in the City of Orange. In the Orange County. </br></br> 

UCI: Okay, great. Thank you so much. So, tell me about your experience.</br></br>

Caller: So, when the pandemic first came it was, quite frankly something that we didn’t even know what the word pandemic meant. You know, most of us here. There was definitely a lot of secrecy among staff and they weren’t providing information to us about what was going on.</br></br> 

We just know that suddenly visits were cancelled. And just like that we weren’t able to see our family members any more. It was tough because just losing that connection with our families and being able to see them on the weekends. You know, many of us didn’t know that we were seeing some of our family members for the last time. Never seeing them again.</br></br>

You know, I lost a close relative while in here. I know a friend that lost his wife to cancer and never got to say goodbye, never got to see her again. So, it’s been an experience where there’s. It’s been revealing to us on what we are seen as.</br></br> 

You know, to many people. I know that the sheriff was very outspoken about not releasing people and you know, fear mongering. You know, telling people that, even stopped referring to us as inmates, as we were once referred to. He just started calling us “those public safety threats.”</br></br> 

So, it was hard to see that because you know, many of us don’t see ourselves that way. You know, there’s people in here who suffer from many different issues. Mental health issues, substance use issues, and definitely not the way that we were portrayed. So, it made us feel like, you know, we were not human.</br></br> 

But it was also an experience that led to new connections with people who were advocating and fighting for our rights behind bars. So, that was something beautiful to experience as well because we got to see that there’s people out there that also do care and that don’t allow fear mongering to interfere with their beliefs and their values.</br></br>

But here in Orange County, in particular, like it was bad. Every single precaution that was taken for COVID was only done after, you know, multiple lawsuits from the American Civil Liberties Union. And it wasn’t until, you know, those lawsuits went to court and judges gave orders that the sheriff began to do things differently. But even then, he was defiant to judge’s orders and.</br></br>

Yeah we’ve seen over a 1,000 people become infected with COVID. We were in areas, congregate areas with people who were COVID positive and we were COVID negative. For someone like me who suffers from preexisting medical conditions it was very, very scary.</br></br> 

And, you know, just it went from, you know, no visits. We stopped receiving hot meals. All we, to this day, all we get is sack lunches. Cold baloney sandwiches. Often the food is spoiled. It’s not edible. And so, we’ve had to depend on things, like commissary, that they sell here.</br></br> 

It’s been a burden on our families who are already suffering economically because of the pandemic. And, you know, it’s just been really tough. Just being able to communicate with them. A phone call is $9 per phone call. So, it’s just been very, very difficult to stay in touch with them.</br></br> 

And many of us, including myself, suffer from mental health issues. And, so being in a tiny cell the size of a parking space for 23-hours a day is overwhelming. Is really overwhelming and really, you know, if it wasn’t for organizations like the American Civil Liberties Union, Transforming Justice Orange County here in California, here in Orange County we wouldn’t have a voice. We wouldn’t be heard.</br></br> 

But it’s really thanks to everybody who’s been advocating for us out there that we’ve seen a little bit of change. But not much.</br></br> 

I think everything the sheriff has done has been against his own will. So, just to see that it kind of, it makes you feel like you’re less than a human. Worse than even a second-class citizen. But, you know, I think that the sheriff has his agenda and believes that he needs to keep us behind bars because part of his agenda is to, you know, fill the beds.</br></br> 

It’s money and politics. But there’s real lives that are being affected by that. All his decisions are affecting real people.</br></br> 

And I have seen how devastating it’s been for family members, for people behind bars. I know that about a month ago someone committed suicide. The conditions in here are, you know, inhumane. I know that people with mental health issues are not being treated.</br></br> 

Are not being treated properly. They’re not receiving the medical attention that they need or the mental health attention that they need.</br></br> 

So, it’s been tough but it’s also been enlightening. In many ways and it’s, like I said, it’s created connections and many of us have realized that we are oppressed by a system that doesn’t believe that we deserve second chances. But we are not suppressed. So, we still have a voice, even from behind bars and, you know, being able to use our voice to speak out against the living conditions behind bars and the terrible experiences that we’ve endured and suffered.</br></br> 

It has created momentum in the battle and the fight to end mass incarceration and to replace it with a system that treats people with mental health, that treats people that have substance use issues and that deals with the social issues in our communities in a different way.</br></br>

So, you know, the struggles are still going on. There’s a lot of things that we’re still experiencing. A lot of retaliation for speaking out. And just, you know, an oppressive system that tries to separate us from our families, from our communities.</br></br> 

I know that many of us, including myself, have made mistakes. And, you know, I know that from speaking to guys in here, and this includes myself, we. We hold ourselves accountable for what we’ve done. We know that we’ve made mistakes.</br></br> 

But to be treated the way that we have been treated throughout this whole year, I think it says a lot about the way that law enforcement sees us and the way that they are able to get away with things. I just hope that from this experience that people will pay a little more attention to what goes on behind bars and hopefully, you know, use their voice, use their vote and their power to change this punitive system that is not solving any problems, is not helping the problem with mass incarceration and it’s not rehabilitating anybody.</br></br>

There’s people like me that need help. We ask for help, we want to participate in rehabilitated programs and be able to become better people, so that when we return to our societies we can contribute. But all we see is walls.</br></br> 

You know, I’m in my cell nearly 23-hours a day and just. Absolutely no opportunities to rehabilitate myself, in a way that I know would help me so that I can return to society and contribute, and give back.</br></br> 

But, you know, we’re still, we’re still pushing through, we’re still doing our best, we’re being resilient and trying to just overcome all the obstacles and burdens that we must deal with in here. But you know, at the end of the day it’s really the people out there that are making the difference. And I’m thankful to everyone, to every advocate, to every person that has spoken up and that believes that we deserve better treatment.</br></br> 

People that believe that we are not just humans in name only, and I believe that with more people like this real change will come and if anything good has come out of this, is the fact that more people are paying attention and are listening to our struggles and to our experiences.</br></br> 

UCI: That was amazing. Thank you so much for sharing that. We really do appreciate, you know, you taking the time to share your testimony.</br></br> 

And I think you said it so well. That you know, my last question was going to be if you wanted anyone to know about what your experience is like, what would it be? And I think you said it perfectly.</br></br> 

Is there anything else you would like to add? I mean how is the vaccination process been going? Is it going?</br></br> 

Caller: It’s going. It’s not from. I was vaccinated because I have underlying health conditions. I know that there is no education being provided to people about the vaccines.</br></br> 

There’s a lot of conspiracy theories floating around and people have questions. And I do not, for one second, you know, feel that anybody who has questions in here shouldn’t. I mean, we have every reason to doubt anything that the sheriff does. That, you know, he claims is to benefit us.</br></br> 

Every single chance he’s had he’s tried to, you know, hurt us. He has not tried to help us. And so now him going around and saying, “Hey, look there’s a vaccine available, you guys should take it.” But we don’t trust him.</br></br> 

You know, we trust the vaccines, we don’t trust the people administering the vaccines.</br></br> 

So, I just went with my gut. I took the two shots, the pfizer shot. But, you know, there’s people that just don’t trust. People don’t trust and they’re not making a real effort to educate incarcerated individuals about the benefits of a vaccine.</br></br> 

And they even go along with conspiracy theories. You know. </br></br>

It’s definitely not going the way it should. And, again, it’s from lack of trust. When somebody has hurt you so much and somebody has taken your humanity away and to suddenly say, “Hey, trust me now.” Yeah, it doesn’t, it’s not going to work out.</br></br> 

And I think that as long as the sheriff continues to be behind the vaccination process and. Many people are going to refuse and not take the vaccine.</br></br> 

UCI: Absolutely. So, did you get comfortable with, you know, yourself getting vaccinated through friends and family, through media? How did you decide to get vaccinated then?</br></br> 

Caller: A lot of it has to do from, you know, things I read in the newspaper, the benefits. Again, I have preexisting medical conditions that could potentially lead to my death if I was contract the coronavirus.</br></br> 

So, it was a lot of distrust for the sheriff being behind it but at the same time I just felt like, you know, I had to take the risk. Because I was already in so much risk as it was. You know, there was over, close to over fifteen-hundred people tested positive for COVID. And I was around close to 10 of them in a sixteen cell sector.</br></br> 

So, I felt that I was already in a lot of risk and danger. So, I just went for it and took the vaccine. I know, like I said, there was no education, nobody came and told me what was going on. They just said do you want the vaccine, yes or no?</br></br> 

And I took it, then 21 days later I took the second dose.</br></br> 

But, yeah I mean, it was, a lot of it had to do with just me going for it and hoping that whatever I was getting would not hurt me. But I know that a lot of guys in here just don’t feel like this is the place to get the vaccine. And they prefer, I know many guys have said, “Hey, I’ll wait ‘til I’m released because I really don’t want to get it in here.</br></br> 

And it’s sad because, you know, there’s people in here who really need the vaccine and who would really benefit from the vaccine. But it just goes to show that this department is not one that people trust. And, you know, just it’s a horrible feeling when you’re sitting here watching on TV how the sheriff, you know, generalizes everybody. Puts everybody into one group and stops referring to you as anything other than “those public safety threats.”</br></br> 

You know, I just, I remember seeing that for the first time and it was, it was tough because I’ve been working so hard and diligently too. To become a better person and to hopefully someday return back to society. But to be labeled as nothing more than that was painful. It was painful.</br></br> 

It kind of makes you feel like, you know, it makes you wonder if there’s anything you can actually do to ever, you know, find redemption. Or to ever be able to lose that stigma that follows us and reintegrate into society. But, like I said, it’s the people out there, those that continue to fight for us and that believe in us, that also inspire us, motivate us to keep pushing through all the adversity and all the retaliation. And I think losing that fear to speak out has been empowering in itself.</br></br> 

And is giving us our humanity back. Even though it’s with absolutely no help or assistance from the Orange County’s sheriff department.</br></br> 

UCI: Absolutely. And we appreciate you sharing your story with us. And if there’s nothing else you want to share, I feel like you’ve covered every question we could have asked. I just wanted to say thank you so much again for being vulnerable enough to share your story with us.</br></br> 

And that if anything changes or any circumstances change please feel free to call us back and to tell other people as well.</br></br> 

Caller: Yeah, no thank you so much for allowing me the opportunity.</br></br>

UCI: Absolutely, yeah you have a great rest of your night. Thank you.</br></br> 

Caller: You too. Alright. Bye-bye.</br></br>

UCI: Buh-Bye.
