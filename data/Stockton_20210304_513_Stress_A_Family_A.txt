This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Stockton.</br></br>

One supreme positive I've learned presently, if you can't find peace in yourself, especially in these times, where will you find it? I genuinely believe in finding the positive within the most dire circumstances! Taking the first step with a good thought.</br></br>

I urge all, to make finding peace within themselves a priority. The challenges within the Covid-19 pandemic showed me personally, the importance of pursuing internal peace. And yet, at times I'm depressed, sitting in the complete darkness of a 4X4 prison cell.</br></br>

I feel my heart literally beating two times faster than it has ever had before I was incarcerated. Especially having done the majority of my prison sentence within maximum security prisons. When the pandemic began globally, it turned 22 hours already in a cell, to a complete 24 hour day! Isolated.</br></br>

Not being able to consistently communicate with your loved ones, it's very damaging psychologically! Your mind begins to play tricks on you, questioning whether they really care for you, or if you should burden them with a depressing prison call, complaining of constant injustice, and oppression.</br></br>
