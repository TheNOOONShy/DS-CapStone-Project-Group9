It’s hard enough soldiering on with the everyday business of incarceration, and now the heavy burden of having to mentally cope with this coronavirus pandemic, it’s tough. Imagine, like most in the county jail, who are stuck in limbo with their pending court cases; most sitting in jail because they can’t afford to make bail.</br></br>

Instead, the courts have all but shut down more less, if like many went to their initial arraignment and took their public defender’s advice to postpone and waived their right to a speedy trial. They’re now on the court’s time, and can wait indefinitely legally. Which the courts have exercised, this past year.</br></br>

Now to sit in jail with the weight of just being away from family, loved ones, and friends. Most fighting charges that can possibly send them away for decades for something that should only be a couple years at most.</br></br>

Take this example really quick. I’m a few cells away from a 26 year old african american who just received 25 years to life sentence for a violent third strike for a mutual fight, caught on camera, which he didn’t initiate. Even the victim said so. But simply because he is Black in Orange County, he was struck out.</br></br>

Myb current celly (cellmate) also assaulted a man much more violently, though he is not black. He received seven years with half who’s also a third striker. The criminal justice system is indeed biased and extremely unfair.</br></br>

So imagine all this on top of everything else. I come back to visits, where visits is our only true real getaway from this place of horror, of misery! So to have this one equalizer in our lives taken from us, really takes its toll.</br></br>

I’m so close to so many of my family and friends, but limited to calls and letters. It’s not only agonizing but creates this indescribable rage, knowing it’s also now being manipulated under the guise of COVID-19 health and safety protocol restrictions.</br></br>

To tell someone who’s personally aware about officials callous concerns for our personal health and safety, and now use that as their justification for visiting restrictions is hypocrisy- period! It pisses (me) off!</br></br>

While many examples have been presented to jail officials regarding ways to safely open visits, or how other correctional institutions have opened visitings, here, they’ve gone simply ignored. It’s frustrating, then it just turns into anger. To know our loved ones are so close and want to come, but can’t. So that's that.</br></br>

I almost forgot to mention while I caught coronavirus and was on quarantine I had an accident in my cell and broke my pinky finger. I notified medical staff immediately, but received an ice pack… and yes you guessed it. Drink lots of water!</br></br>

No pain medication even after such an obvious fracture of my pinky turned the other way, swollen fat. It made no difference. They said I had to wait for an x-ray, just because they refused to send me out on an emergency care run. To make a very long story short, to an already long story, I was finally sent out on an emergency care run, a month later!</br></br>

Even my surgeon at UC Irvine at orange asked why I took so long to see him? All the while I was in pain and certainly hydrated from all the water I drank in hopes that perhaps they’d be right and water takes away pain. It didn’t. I had surgery about a month and a half later, and now have permanent damage to my finger cause they took so long.</br></br>

I’m COVID-19 free now, I took the vaccine. Yes of course, Johnson and Johnson. No blood clots thankfully. I’m headstrong and genuinely happy and positive focused. So despite all of this I know there's plenty of things to look forward to, smile and be happy for.</br></br>

I try to be optimistic about life. I know that even while in here there are millions of other people who don’t have the things I’m fortunate enough to have, even in here. So I’m grateful and appreciate my blessings, and continue to keep myself focused on things that will help me later on in life.
