This story was told by a person incarcerated at Tulare Bob Wiley Detention Center.</br></br>

UCI: Okay and what has the COVID situation been like at your facility?</br></br>

Caller: What's the - excuse me?</br></br>

UCI: Oh, what has the COVID situation been like at your facility?</br></br>

Caller: It's been pretty crazy, like we recently had a big outbreak. It went from like - we saw it on the news it went from 30 people to 80 people in like three days. And then we seen it in our unit.</br></br>  

A girl came in and tested positive and about a week later six people tested positive. And it's just been like crazy. No one can - no one will answer any questions.</br></br> 

Like it's just been scary, like being in our cell. Like only being able to come out like 15 to 30 minutes per day and just not knowing if we’re gonna get sick or not, you know?</br></br>

Caller: Hello?</br></br>

UCI: Oh I hear you, sorry. By any chance did you call on your - on a free phone call?</br></br>

Caller: Oh I probably did because I haven’t used it.</br></br>

UCI: Oh okay. If you want to call back, cause I know it did say one minute left. If you want to callback, our program actually does pay for the phone call, so you wouldn't have to pay anything.</br></br>  

Just for when it ends. And so we can continue hearing your story – </br></br>

Caller: [unintelligible] – so I’d have to start all over huh?</br></br>

UCI: No you can start from - I wouldn't have to read the consent form from the beginning. I would recognize your voice.</br></br>

Caller: [unintelligible]  – you're gonna answer the phone?</br></br>

UCI: Yeah I’ll be here.</br></br>

Caller: Okay then I’ll call right back.</br></br>

UCI: Okay sounds good, thank you.</br></br>

Caller: Okay. Alright bye.</br></br>

UCI: Hello, I was just speaking to you right?</br></br>

Caller: Okay, yeah.</br></br>

UCI: Okay awesome. You were telling me about what the COVID situation was like at your facility.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah, so there was a breakout in the unit and then – it just seemed like they didn't know what to do, you know? So people kept getting sick in our unit. The numbers kept jumping and then finally they moved the people that tested positive to another unit after a bunch of people caught it. And it's just - it's been hard.</br></br>

Like there's no programs, you know. We only get out like 30, 15 to 30 minutes a day out of our cells. I haven't seen no church volunteers since all this started. It's just hard.</br></br>  

There's hardly any books. No resource - we have no resources. Like - and it's been hard. Like, I’ve been - I’m slipping into like a depression; just trying to get myself to get up everyday, you know?</br></br>

UCI: Yeah definitely. How have you been coping with this?</br></br> 

Caller: I’m just like trying to - I think my times up. They only give me 15 minutes.</br></br>

UCI: Oh no.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah. So - but I wrote you guys so you guys will get a letter from me and then - cause they're telling me we have to lockdown.</br></br> 

UCI: Okay if you ever get another chance and you want to keep telling your story you can call us again. Or if you ever have any more information to share you can also write us another letter if you're into letter writing. But thank you so much for calling tonight.</br></br>

Caller: Because we don't get out to programs from five to nine. Like they're just letting me use the phone cause I asked. Like they’re just making an exception for me.</br></br>

UCI: Oh okay I see.</br></br>

Caller: Yeah so we only get programs like during the day. It's usually in the morning.</br></br>  

UCI: Oh okay and our hours are from five to nine so it doesn't really –</br></br> 

Caller: Yeah. Yeah so it's hard but – okay I'll try to encourage other inmates to call you guys too.</br></br>

UCI: Yeah definitely. Thank you and also writing us yeah. Thank you so much.</br></br> 

Caller: Okay thank you.</br></br>

UCI: Thank you, have a good night.</br></br>

Caller: Okay bye.</br></br>

UCI: Bye bye.</br></br>

Caller: Bye.</br></br>
