To the students at U.C. Irvine, thank you for your concerns, and the help with reforms I started the pandemic, in South West Detention Center in Riverside County, hearing and watching the news on the pandemic, it was hard to believe, from there it, became a reality for all of us, the jails stopped everything, visiting, court dates, etc..The people they had in custody, they didn’t release, and at the same time, they didn’t arrest anybody, it was weird. One day the officer said, you guys are going lockdown, because of COVID-19, for two weeks, then back to normal program, well it’s been a year.. and still lockdown.</br></br> 


Nobody, seen this coming, I’ve been through two different county jails, in the same county, they opened Indio County jail up, just to house sentenced inmates, thousands of us. “CDCR” wouldn’t open intake, for six months.. Think about be sentenced.. Talking to your family, I’m going to prison.. sooner or later. This pandemic has been one of the hardest, and most stressfulest, situation I’ve ever been in. With a court trial, that I lost, that took months, extra to get through. Being cut off from are familys, the feeling of being alone, am in CDCR now.. That took six months after being sentenced, to get to “CDCR” they don’t inform our familys if we get, “COVID”, sick.</br></br>


The whole building go’s on quarantine, we don’t even come out of our cells, shower, phone call that’s it. I just went through reception, Delano State Prison.. You start with quarantine, for two weeks. Then move to different building.. With people from all over.</br></br>


The problem, is organization, of inmate housing, quarantine buildings are changing all the time, one half of the building will be quarantine the other half won't, one half will be quarantine, the other half infected, the point we are all in the same building.., they have so much going on, there's no control.. There's no way “CDCR”, is reporting the number of cases, there’s hundreds, if not thousands, there trying to control it “with lockdowns”, which is helping to an extent, but at the same time, mentality challenging the inmate population, it’s a stressful situation.. COVID-19, changed everybody’s lives, including mine, am an inmate at Calipatria State Prison.. With a life sentence.</br></br>


Praying for reform,</br></br>


I have a question for the students about reform laws? There’s alot going on, my situation, three strikes, and three, five years priors, enhancements.</br></br>


I was sentenced to 41 years, where my crime only carried eight years max, with all the enhancement laws I got 33 years in enhancements for my past crimes.</br></br>


What am asking is there any information on reforms three strikes..?</br></br>


Thank you for caring.</br></br>


Sincerely,
