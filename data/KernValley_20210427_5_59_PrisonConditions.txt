UCI: What has the COVID situation been at your facility?</br></br>

Caller: I recently just got here. I was in, prior to this, I was in Salinas Valley State Prison. So, I was in a mental health ward and basically it was different than what everybody else was going through at right here on the yard, so I’m not sure.</br></br>

UCI: Well, would you like just to tell your experience about, your experience with COVID?</br></br>

Caller: It’s just that, we were just lockdown basically. We were on lockdown, nothing was happening. A lot of people didn’t know what was going on at that time. So just, we seen it on the news, people got sick, but it wasn’t bad, so I’m not even, I don’t even have much of an experience to be honest with you.</br></br>

UCI: Mmhmm. And what is the vaccination situation been like at your facility now?</br></br>

Caller: Where I'm at now, I got vaccinated at Salinas Valley so I was pretty quick. I think it was pretty quick. We got both shots, and it seems, I think they worked quick.</br></br>

UCI: Mmhmm. And how’ve you been coping with the crisis?</br></br>

Caller: Just, I think pretty good. I think I'm just, we're stuck, we're stuck, so it doesn't make a difference [unintelligible]. I was in, like I said, I was in a mental health ward so like, we were trying to do, keep us busy. I just, we went on lockdown like twice and it was, I don’t know, any other day, kind of, you know.
