Hello,</br></br>

I received your letter today and think it’s great that there are people out there besides our own immediate families who care about the treatment of inmates. I come from a good family and have just made some bad decisions and that leads to why I’m writing this letter on the treatment during the pandemic. I got here August 2020 so they were well into it. But it’s been hard.</br></br>

There were no outside visitations allowed starting in February 2020. They just started to allow one visit every 30 days by appointment only for a half an hour. This just started on March 27, 2021. So, there were no visits for even a year. There have been no outside programs here at all — no church, no AA, no nothing.</br></br>

In the same amount of time, when I got here last August I was put in quarantine but 19 days before, moved to [redacted] housing. About November 2020, people around me started to test positive for COVID-19. They still test people daily. But at first someone would test positive and they would only move that person to quarantine and leave their celly. It seemed pointless just to move one.</br></br>

But it has gotten a lot better here now they have vaccinated everyone who wanted it around us. The worst part about all of this here has been the food. In October 2020, they stopped hot meals all together, here. So for six months now we have been getting bologna sandwiches three times a day. They have vaccinated severyone, stopped the intake quarantine, but we still get sack lunches three times a day.</br></br>

Thank you for caring.
