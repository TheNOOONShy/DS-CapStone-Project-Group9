This story was told by a person incarcerated at Donovan.</br></br>

UCI: Okay. Thank you so much. Okay. So just kind of basically like you were saying, what are some of your concerns about COVID inside right now?</br></br>Caller: Inmates?</br></br>UCI: Yes.</br></br>Caller: Inmates' concern - a big concern is not being able to see our families because visitation is shut down.</br></br>Guys are worried about one small outbreak spreading to, you know, spreading quickly. Because we don't know what that will mean for the rest of the yard. I think a big part of it is the additional shock is over.</br></br>And the problem is this like continuing - it feels like a drawn out process for a lot of guys. And they're kind of wanting to get back to normal, just as everybody is. But seeing each other's family is the biggest issue right now.</br></br>UCI: Yeah. That</br></br>Caller: You know.</br></br>UCI: makes sense.</br></br>Caller: And, obviously, we can't do that.</br></br>UCI: How has this been affecting your family, if you don't mind me asking?</br></br>Caller: It has been difficult. There has been a lot of change in my family right now. And, without going into too much detail, I don't know how I will see them in the future.</br></br>Because, well, I could have been able to see them before. But, going into the future - if visiting opens up, say, tomorrow or something - then, I won't be able to see them. So - my family - it's difficult because there was no like, I guess, closure. And, again, without going into too much detail, but it has been difficult in my family.</br></br>One of my close family members - I'm kind of the only person that they go see. So they kind of feel isolated that they can't go out and see family. Because this particular family member doesn't have a lot of family in the area. So there was that one connection.</br></br>Letters are great. Phone calls are great. But there is still something lost between that face-to-face sit down at a table with someone. So it has been very difficult for my family that is here.</br></br>UCI: I'm sorry to hear that.</br></br>Caller: Yeah. Well, it's, you know, that's the way it is for everybody, unfortunately. You know? Not just people in here.</br></br>UCI: Yeah.</br></br>Caller: But there's a lot of guys who want to see their wives, a lot of guys who want to see their parents. Aging population has aging parents.</br></br>UCI: Yeah. On a little bit of a different note, could you, maybe, walk me through how everything started in there at your facility like when the news and information first broke about the pandemic? How was everything handled? How did you and, you know, your fellow prisoners react to it?</br></br>Caller: Much like the country, it was split between how many people really took it seriously and how many people were on the verge of overreacting. There were people who were like, well, it won't get in here, so we don't have anything to worry about.</br></br>But, then, once people started realizing that staff coming in - they still go out and participate in life. So them coming in, there was a fear of interaction. A lot of people were annoyed with having to wear the masks and the program changing.</br></br>There was a lady named [unintelligible] who supplied the institution with many, many masks. I think it was 5,500.</br></br>So she has been a godsend. I don't know how many people have been protected because she reacted and her people reacted so quickly.</br></br>I wouldn't even say, "reacted." They responded so quickly. It was - it could have helped more than we know. But there was a fear that kind of nobody really wanted to talk about. Like what happens if it does spread in here? What happens if it does get in here? If we choose not to talk about it, maybe, it won't happen. I think there was a large percentage of the population who may not have communicated that.</br></br>But that was a feeling - a general feeling. Slowly, the programs started getting shut down. And I mean it was like, within a week, we're gonna social distance and wear masks to we're gonna break up yards to we're going to - they thought one building had an outbreak. And it was quarantined for two weeks, I think.</br></br>Give or take. And work stations are broken up by buildings now. So, if you have people from all three buildings working at one place, then, one day, one building would come in. The next day, another building would come in. And it would just be on this rotating basis.</br></br>So there's not communication in between the buildings. And, even in the dayrooms, it's limited.</br></br>UCI: And that's</br></br>Caller: Does that answer your question?</br></br>UCI: Yes, that did. And that's still what it's like now - is that you guys are on this higher level of just everyone's divided up and being kept separate. Correct?</br></br>Caller: Yeah. For the most part, yes.</br></br>In very limited instances, people see each other like - oddly enough, the clinic is somewhere where all the buildings come together.</br></br>UCI: Yeah.</br></br>Caller: Well, that kind of goes for our time.</br></br>UCI: Yes. Yes. Well, thank you so much. I really appreciate you calling in and being our test call. I'm going to turn off the recording device right now.
