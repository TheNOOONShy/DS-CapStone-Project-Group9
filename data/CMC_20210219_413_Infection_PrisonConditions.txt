This letter was written by a person incarcerated at CMC (California Menâ€™s Colony).</br></br>

On the date of receipt of your letter (2/8/21), I was on quarantine due to having contracted COVID-19. I delayed answering your letter until I was off of quarantine, as I wanted to make certain I was not sending COVID-19 out with this letter. I hope the delay did not create an inconvenience. </br></br>

Before I go into the questions outlined in your letter, I want to make it clear that I am aware that people outside of prison have suffered far more than I have. I am aware that due to the pandemic people have lost their jobs, people have lost their businesses, people have lost their savings, I am certain many have concerns over how they will be able to feed their families. Of course people have lost family members to the virus and family members were not allowed to attend the funeral. I at least will be fed, no matter what and I will have a place to sleep.</br></br>

With all this said, I will answer some of your questions. In two months I will be 66 years old, so I have been concerned about contracting COVID-19. The answer to your question, no I do not and have not felt safe. One concern most inmates I have talked to is custody staff are, or appeared to be of the opinion that the inmate population are the carriers and spreaders of the virus. As you know, the only way, it can come into the institution is through those leaving and returning to th e institution on a daily basis.</br></br>

As for visits, I have not had a visit in years. My relatives live out of state and cannot travel to California just to visit me. The last visit I had was with a friend who lived in this state; however, he passed away a couple of years ago. So the pandemic has not impacted me in this way.</br></br>

In May, 2020, this institution was placed on a modified program. I was not allowed to go to work after that. My job was a pay position ($36.00 a month), so I lost that income.</br></br>

While on quarantine I am restricted to my cell 24 hours a day. I am allowed a shower every other day and a phone call to family every two days. When not on quarantine the inmates where I am housed are allowed daily showers, daily phone calls and one hour on the yard. So, basically restricted to cells 23 hours a day.</br></br>
