Well, first of all, thank you, for getting in contact with me. I don’t know how you got my info, but it is alright, I don’t mind. I will share a small portion of my story behind bars. I don’t know how interesting my story will be to you. I have been incarcerated since July [redacted] 1995 for a traffic violation (VC) evading arrest. I have three strikes, non-violent. Everyone in my family has passed away, including my wife. I have no kids. I am a 55-year-old Black male. I feel that being incarcerated for 25-plus years is over the top.</br></br> 

I have tried every attempt through appeals and the court system. I was supposed to go my parole board hearing on February [redacted] 2020, but they (COs) found a cell phone by my bed area. It wasn't mine, but nobody was willing to claim it. I am in dorm living, so many people (inmates) could have put it in my bed area. So I was denied parole for three years for the phone. I have non-violent RVRs (rules violating reports) since I've been incarcerated. I am housed in a lower level institution because of my positive programming. I have done everything possible to get out of prison. I have such horrible luck.</br></br>
 
I live in Los Angeles. I came to California from New York City at the age of 12. I started associating myself with street gangs and that’s where my problem started. My mother was a single parent, trying to make ends meet. She had to work several jobs. But she took good care of me. I was just too wild and curious about the streets and that started my life of being locked up. Fortunately, I never used any drugs or harmed anyone seriously. I am not a violent person at all. I am just a person who does not make smart choices. I am doing my best to be a much different person. It just does not seem like I am ever going to be a free man, ever again.</br></br>
 
Everybody (inmates) around me are getting sick from coronavirus. CDC cannot do much to keep us safe. Staff are getting us sick. But I don’t think they can do anything to prevent the virus to getting to us. Unless they put everybody in cells. They (CDC) don't have enough room for that. Family and friends are all gone. I had a pen-pal, but she lost too many of her family members to this pandemic, so she doesn't write anymore. So life for me is not good for me at all! My future is just a big dark cloud. They try to say that “everybody’s life matters.” This is not true. They are trying to make it seem like I'm too dangerous for society. 25 years for a traffic violation is too much time being locked-up. I know that I have made some bad choices in my life, but this is not right. And nobody cares!</br></br>
 
Well, now that I am completely depressed, I will end this story. Don’t know if this is enough to make a story for you, but I would rather be free again than to keep getting my hopes high up again, just to be let down or disappointed! I have a copy of my criminal history, just in case you want to see if I am telling the truth. I hope you and your staff has a nice day. Thank you for your concern.</br></br>
 
Sincerely,
