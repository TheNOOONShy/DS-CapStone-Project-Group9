This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Solano.</br></br>

“What has it been like to have reduced visitation from family and love ones”? It’s been very hard on pretty much all of us we only get to talk to them on the phone. The one good thing that the phone company “GTL” did was give free calls to people that have no money. That was a act of kindness that needs to happen more often in our country.</br></br>

Now they know how their family’s health is and their family knows theirs.</br></br>

“How have you been coping with this crisis”? Well so far so good only a few others of my family have caught COVID-19 but we all pulled through okay. But I’m not gonna lie I feel for all the Americans that have lost their lives. I pray for those families that lost their love ones.</br></br>  

It’s a very sad time worldwide.</br></br>

“How have the vaccinations been going at your facility”? Honestly it seems like it’s going fair with the amount of vaccines available. I saw people get shots that probably could of waiting for all the older people to get it first. But again I don’t know those people’s health conditions.</br></br>

Well that’s it I guess, sorry if you can’t use my letter. I would of said more, but that’s not a good idea from where I’m sitting. Hope you’ll understand. Thank you so much for everything you do and the person you are.</br></br>

God bless you and your family goodnight.
