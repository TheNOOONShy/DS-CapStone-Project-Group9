This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Vacaville.</br></br>
I am a 58-year-old inmate/patient. I’m currently in captivity here at CMF Vacaville. I’ve been here since 2015, approximately. I’ve been incarcerated since 1995 for a horrendous act I could never carry out. I’ve never killed or seriously committed an act of harm on anyone ever in my life. Yet, accused and unjustly tried and convicted. I’ve served 25 years now.</br></br> I’m a high-risk, with underlying medical conditions such as coccidioidomycosis/valley fever, severe degenerative joint arthritis, pre-diabetes, hepatitis C. Also suffering from mental health conditions. I’m filing grievances, etc… seeking release to get home to my family. My release date is some ways off, yet with help I can gain a much-deserved parole soon. If you or anyone else decides to become familiar with my struggle, you’d be surprised and blessed in more than one way. I’m a knowledgeable, positive, facilitator, life skills coach, builder, healer, and helper, lover of life and people who love life.</br></br> I’ve grown into the man I’ve always meant to be, and I need to get out there with the rest of you and do good for our society and planet. If I were to lose my life to CDCR, it would be a great waste. I’ve got so much good to give society. Is there any way you can help me gain justice and freedom? I’d owe you my life and I swear you’ll never regret the deed. I’m so devoted to celebrating and sharing sobriety, life, recovery, compassion, care, solutions, and more. If you can be of any help to me please send me information, advice, and/or notify [redacted].</br></br> We are at an uphill battle, but with help God does bless us through us and our faith. I hope to hear from you in the near future. God bless you all and your all shalom.
