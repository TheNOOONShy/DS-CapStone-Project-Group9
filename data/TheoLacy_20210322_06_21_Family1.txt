This story was told by a person incarcerated at Theo Lacy.</br></br>

UCI: Perfect. Okay. So, the time is now 6:20PM, March 22. So, what facility are you at?</br></br>

Caller: I’m currently at the Theo. Sorry, I’m at the TheoLacy facility in the City of Orange. In the Orange County. </br></br> 

UCI: Okay, great. Thank you so much. So, tell me about your experience.</br></br>

Caller: So, when the pandemic first came it was, quite frankly something that we didn’t even know what the word pandemic meant. You know, most of us here. There was definitely a lot of secrecy among staff and they weren’t providing information to us about what was going on.</br></br> 

We just know that suddenly visits were cancelled. And just like that we weren’t able to see our family members any more. It was tough because just losing that connection with our families and being able to see them on the weekends. You know, many of us didn’t know that we were seeing some of our family members for the last time. Never seeing them again.</br></br>

You know, I lost a close relative while in here. I know a friend that lost his wife to cancer and never got to say goodbye, never got to see her again. So, it’s been an experience where, there’s.  It’s been revealing to us on what we are seen as.</br></br> 

You know, to many people. I know that the sheriff was very outspoken about not releasing people and you know, fear mongering. You know, telling people that, even stopped referring to us as inmates, as we were once referred to. He just started calling us “those public safety threats.”</br></br> 

So, it was hard to see that because you know, many of us don’t see ourselves that way. You know, there’s people in here who suffer from many different issues. Mental health issues, substance use issues, and definitely not the way that we were portrayed. So, it made us feel like, you know, we were not human.</br></br>
