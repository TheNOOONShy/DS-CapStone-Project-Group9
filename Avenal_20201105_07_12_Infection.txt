UCI: And then what is troubling or concerning you?</br></br>Caller: I would have to say that in my opinion, there's only one way we're - we could get COVID-19 after being, I guess you could say, separated from society or family or loved ones for - what is this - it's beginning of March this year, and that's the staff who gets to go home every day and come back, go out, come back, go out, come back.</br></br>And I guess that's what a lot of people who tested negative were afraid about is them coming out positive, and that's the only way people come out positive is, like I said, we can't go home every day, you know?</br></br>Somebody's bringing it in and it's not us.
