Dear PrisonPandemic,</br></br>


I was asked to write to you about my experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic.</br></br>


Well, where do I begin? Back in October of 2019 I was laid off from my I.W.L (Inmate Work Laborer) construction job as an electrician due to staff misappropriating 2.5 million dollars over a three month period. Ever since this happened I have continued to be unemployed to this date.</br></br> 


In the beginning of the pandemic I was constantly worried for my family and praying they do not catch COVID-19. So far my family has not caught COVID-19.</br></br>


While I was unemployed I began to do my hobby of making jewelry (see enclosed) so I could keep some kind of income coming in. It didn’t bring much because here in prison I had to keep my prices so low to induce sales. So I basically could provide myself with necessities (i.e. shampoo, soap, razors, coffee, etc.)</br></br>


In September of 2020 a correctional officer came to work infected with COVID-19 and worked in my dorm. When this officer was finally tested (and came up positive) 17 of my dorm-mates and I became infected with the virus.</br></br> 


We all suffered the severe symptoms of COVID-19 without any kind of treatment from medical staff. They only monitored our vitals (i.e. temperature, blood pressure, pulse ox %) while we were symptomatic. It was as if they were observing us to see if we will die from the virus or not.</br></br> 


Even so, nine prisoners died here at CMC as a result of COVID-19. After I and my dorm-mates “resolved” from COVID-19 we were returned to our dorm. (This whole time I was preparing my lawsuit for cruel and unusual punishment).</br></br>


In October the federal court ruled that we were entitled to apply for the stimulus and we filed our income tax paper to receive our stimulus payments. When we received our checks we were ridiculed by the prison guards, as they felt we didn’t deserve it, but failing to realize that the money would be spent keeping people employed and sent home to support our families through the winter. So we ignored their effects and proceeded to use the funds to help people in need and keep their jobs.</br></br>


In January, 127 days after resolving from COVID-19, I contracted COVID-19 a second time. This infection wasn’t as bad as the first, however, it took more of my breathing capacity from me, as I started at 100% pulse ox, and fell to a steady 97% pulse ox, after the second infection. I now get fatigued more rapidly and have many residual effects from the coronavirus. I can no longer walk up a gradual hill without having to stop halfway to catch my breath, when in the Navy I could run up and down hills without losing a step!</br></br>


I still worry about my family and their health because after having COVID-19 two times I would not desire for anyone to come down with this virus, it hurts and takes away daily living function!</br></br>


Anyway, you may keep the gift of the earrings I sent, all I ask is a photo of you or a friend wearing them for my portfolio.
