Hi. How you doing today? Well, as for me, in the best of health, doing my best to stay out of trouble. Time's been very stressful in here due to this COVID-19 outbreak. For the most part, we are stuck inside our cement box, LOL.</br></br>Things have to change for this year. To have a better life in here for inmates like myself. Life is so hard, not able to see my loved ones, our families. Help. Get us get more program, like dayroom and more yard since we can't see our families. More self-help programs, too, like criminal thinking, anger management, AA, NA. More groups, therapy, counseling.</br></br>Anything to keep our minds busy to stay away from all the negativity. We have been following state guideline rules. Please help us have a better year with more program. United States of America. We all stand. We are all in this together.</br></br> 

Thank you and God bless you.
