Dear UC Irvine,</br></br>

My name is [redacted]. I’m writing you this letter because I am very interested in transferring to your school. I am currently a student in college that has been here at my institution. I have a GPA of 3.5.</br></br> 

I am currently working toward getting my bachelor’s degree in sociology and pre-law. I am seeking information on what is needed to receive my bachelor’s degree. Also, any information about your school. Your help in this request is greatly appreciated. I thank you for your time and patience.</br></br>

Sincerely.</br></br>

Dear PrisonPandemic,</br></br>

I’m writing you in regards to your questions pertaining to the COVID-19 pandemic.</br></br>

(What has it been like inside during this time) During the pandemic in this institution there has been 18 deaths due to COVID-19. From the start of the pandemic here in the institution, there was a huge lack of concern and care for the inmates. I admit however now that the conditions have greatly improved.</br></br>

Two. (How have you felt about your safety inside?) At most times I have felt afraid because even though things have improved, we still have staff members who are lacking in the precaution of protection for themselves and others (inmates).</br></br>

Number Three. (What has it been like to have reduced visitation from family and loved ones?) To be honest, it has been very stressful for my friends and family, and for the bigger part of it, myself as well as other inmates.</br></br>

Number Four. (How have you been coping with this crisis?) There is only one way to deal with this crisis for me, and that’s to pray and hope that things get better.</br></br> 

Number Five. (How have the vaccinations been going at your facility?) The vaccinations have been going pretty good.
