PrisonPandemic,</br></br>First and foremost I hope that this missive you and yours in the best of health and spirit. I want to thank you for reaching and sincerely show concern and interest in the struggles and the privations of the men and woman inside these facilities during the COVID-19 pandemic. Thank you and know that you are greatly appreciated.</br></br>I am sure that many of the stories from people who are incarcerated are similar or if not the same. I will try to narrate what I have seen and have been through to the best of my ability.</br></br>Now prison without COVID was hell already, but with the pandemic and some of the conditions we’ve had to deal with this past year would break the will of some of the strongest individuals. Not being able to call and check in with the family for weeks at a time. Being isolated in a cage 24/7. I wouldn’t wish these conditions on my worst enemy.</br></br>

Being deprived of everyday basic things like soap, toilet paper, proper disinfectant to clean our living quarters. Getting half portions on our food. Having our human rights and privileges taken away.</br></br>

And not being given a plausible explanation as to why we can’t call our families, purchase canteen, video visits, packages and showers on a consistent basis.</br></br> 

From the beginning we have been treated as if we brought COVID into the prison. How? The administration at this place handled our COVID breakout poorly and without regard to our lives as human beings.</br></br>

Our safety and livelihood was put into jeopardy as soon as this administration brought people who had COVID to our yard, which had no cases.</br></br>

A lot of people in here, including myself, had COVID and two acquaintances of mine died due to COVID. So I’ve seen first-hand what the lack of preparation and communication can do to people and their families.</br></br>I have dealt with this crisis to the best of my ability by being mindful of not only myself but also of the men and even the staff companies around me. Continuing to stay positive even in the worst of situations. This environment is already meant to demoralize and dehumanize us as individuals. It’s sink or swim in many ways and I’ve seen a lot of people sink.</br></br>Not trying to play devil’s advocate. I know that this pandemic is something new that we all have to deal with. But these people here (administration) are trying to make up for past mistakes only to make more.</br></br>I believe that I can speak for every man, woman and child/teenager that every aspect having to do with this COVID pandemic has been hard for all of us and our families.</br></br>With that being said, I will close this missive. Once again, I thank you for taking the time to reach out and let us on the inside know that we are not alone and forgotten. You are much appreciated.</br></br>
With passion for perfection,</br></br>
Survival and action,</br></br>
Sincerely.
