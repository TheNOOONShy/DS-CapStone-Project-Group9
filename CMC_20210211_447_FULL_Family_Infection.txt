Hello team UC Irvine,</br></br>

I'm feeling much better and each day I feel I'm getting stronger. What has it been like to be inside during this time? I look at it just another day and as far as the COVID-19 goes, I didn't take it real until I got it January 12, 2021.</br></br>

How do I feel about my safety inside? CMC has an excellent medical staff that keep me alive. I'm 68 years old and I have diabetic and high blood pressure. Also I was 25 pounds overweight, but not anymore thanks to COVID-19.</br></br>

About reduced visits? I ask my family if they would not visit years ago. For the reason we were all getting old sometimes a four or five-hour drive one way. I can see the faces on the younger guys who do not get visits, they don't like it, and I don't blame them. We want to be with our loved ones but we can't.</br></br>

How have I been coping? One day at a time. It's my first pandemic and believe me when I say COVID-19 ain't no joke, but I give praise and glory to the most high help me another day.
