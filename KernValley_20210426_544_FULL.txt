Caller: All is well man, how about yourself?</br></br> 


UCI: I’m good, that's good to hear. So which facility are you currently housed at?</br></br> 


Caller: Kern Valley State Prison.</br></br>


UCI: Okay, and what has the COVID situation been like at your facility?</br></br>
 
Caller: Yeah, well I just had, I transferred here last June I was at another prison before, before they lifted the lockdowns. You know it, we was on lockdown from March to June and I came here in June and especially, we kinda masked up and stuff like that.</br></br> 


UCI: Okay.</br></br> 


Caller: Gotta wear a mask everywhere we go, medical, yard, stuff like that.</br></br> 


UCI: And what about like when you guys eat or different things like that, how are they doing that?</br></br> 


Caller: What did you say, you said when we eat?</br></br> 


UCI: Yes.</br></br> 


Caller: Well I'm on a level 4 facility so I eat in my cell, they bring food to the cell.</br></br>  


UCI: Okay for sure, and so since you're probably getting vaccinated now how has the vaccination situation been like in your facility?</br></br>  


Caller: They've been coming, my celly got one done twice, I’ve refused it I don't want it. For my own reasons, but yeah my celly got his twice. I think it was the Moderna one.</br></br> 


UCI: Oh okay, so everybody has been getting it.</br></br>


Caller: Yes, yes sir. If they, if they want to yeah they are offering it.</br></br> 


UCI: Okay and so how have you been coping with the crisis?</br></br> 


Caller: I mean it's kinda difficult, you know what I mean dealing with stuff around here like as far as the program, canteen and other privileges and you know visiting stuff like that's been kinda rough. But I mean everybody been going through it so what, who am I to complain in that regard like that, it's just not, it wasn't, it just didn’t affect prisoners, it affected y’all in the streets as well.</br></br>
  
UCI: Yes that true, so speaking of, about others like how has the COVID situation at your facility affected your loved ones?</br></br>


Caller: Wait, say that again.</br></br>


UCI: How has the COVID situation like at your specific facility, how has it affected your loved ones?</br></br>


Caller: My loved ones, oh yeah, most definitely hard.</br></br> 


UCI: Elaborate on that for me?</br></br>


Caller: Say that again?</br></br> 


UCI: Could you elaborate on that for me?</br></br> 


Caller: Yeah, it's been, it’s been kind of tough. I’m three hours away from home now. And you know, at first it was hard on the phone calls and stuff like that but everything is like, you know, kind of lifting and stuff now. And they are doing hourly visits now for an hour. We have to social distance and I get one hug and one kiss at the beginning of the visiting and the end of the visiting.</br></br> 


Caller: And then we do the, they’ve been offering Zoom visits since December of last year. So that made it kind of, you know, easier, easier too. But I mean it’s hectic on them too cause, you know, want to make sure I’m in the best of health, and you know taken care of as well since they can’t do that themself.</br></br> 


UCI: Right, so what could you say could have make the situation at your facility better?</br></br>  


Caller: You said make it better?</br></br> 


UCI: Yes.</br></br>


Caller: Let me out of here haha.</br></br>


UCI: Haha.</br></br> 


Caller: I wish. I mean I’m just keeping it one hunnid. I rather that people complain and all that you know about being with the kids and their wives or whatever, but I rather be out there dealing with that. Than you know, than in here with a cell, matter whoever I rather be out there with my family going through all that than in here. Keeping it real.</br></br> 


UCI: But what about when it comes to COVID, like how could they make it better?</br></br> 


Caller: How could they, they make it better. Like as far as passing out more cleaning supplies stuff like that disinfectants wipes and stuff like that, and I would assume better masks.</br></br> 


UCI: Alright, well what else did you want the people to know about your experience?</br></br>
