This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Mule Creek.</br></br>

Good day and have a pleasant holiday and happy new year,</br></br>
 
I am writing to you because I’m high risk for COVID-19 and I’m also EOP at Mule Creek State Prison. Staff, COs, and their dignitaries are threatening me with another disciplinary action because I refuse to take a cellmate.</br></br>

I was molested at age 15 and raped in reception. Once I’m placed in a cell with a cellmate, I start to self-harm in order to get out of a traumatizing and uncomfortable situation. I have no one to fight for my mental health needs because mental health and medical are afraid of custody. I’m trying to have medical place me in the completor on SOMS to show that I’m high risk for COVID-19 because I’m asthmatic. But I’m being denied six months to see my medical doctor.</br></br>  

My mom's name is [redacted].</br></br>

I’m enclosing a form from medical which CDC staff says it's not valid unless it’s in SOMS.</br></br>
 
[Redacted].
