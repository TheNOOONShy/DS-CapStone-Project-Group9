This letter was written by a person incarcerated at CIW (California Institution for Women).</br></br>

Not being able to have any visits and see my family was getting really hard to deal with because of the COVID, and now after all this I’ve been through, I could not see my family for support or anything, I was feeling at my lowest. I was scared to talk and say anything! Awhile after this happened, I finally broke down crying one day when I saw my mental health doctor! My safety inside prison is not feeling very safe, In more ways than one! There is no protection or safety at all in here. This has been the worse year in prison for me.</br></br>
 
I will be glad when I get to see my family again! I have suffered too much in the past year! There should be no excuse for what has happened to me. But I am strong today because I have God in my heart and in my life. I don’t know where I would be right now without him. Thank you Jesus! Amen. I have reported what happened to me. I am not receiving any mental health or anything. I just continue to pray and stay close to God! You never know what someone is going through in here. They cannot protect me in here and I have done more than my time. I am a better and changed person! I would tell everybody that is locked up to keep God close to them at all times. It’s the only way you can make it. That goes to everybody in the world as well.</br></br> 

Amen. God bless you.
