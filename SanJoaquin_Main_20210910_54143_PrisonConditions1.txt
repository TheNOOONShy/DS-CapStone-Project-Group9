<em>This story was told by a person incarcerated at San Joaquin County Jail.</br></br></em>

Caller: There's four yards in this facility – big yards – but this was the – what was crazy is because they were bringing people from other yards into the quarantine units. And then, you know, you'd see the medical, you know, van pull up. And then all the officers, of course, they don't want to be around that, but it was their job for transporting; you know?</br></br> 

And they have the gowns on, and then they put an inflatable tent in a little – they call them mini yards. You have one main yard and then each building has what they call a mini yard, a secure little mini yard, and they put – where I was living at, they put one there. And that was, you know, they were putting it up at night, like at 8:00, 9:00 people looking out their windows saying, hey, they're putting up a tent outside.</br></br> 

And, of course, that piqued everyone's curiosity, and that's another, you know, red flag; you know? But they were bringing everybody from different yards here. Then they were full at one time – completely full. And then, of course, I don't know if you know, but Chino was leading the pack in, like, ground zero and in deaths. I don't know if you heard about that.
