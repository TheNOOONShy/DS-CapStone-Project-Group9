Well by the time you get this letter you should of already have gotten my first letter. Which was pretty much answering what I think you was asking me! Not too sure if you were good with my letter right.</br></br>

I really wanted to write more right, but I'm just not knowing if this is a set up to where I'm setting myself and saying things I'm not supposed to be saying. Due to CDCR messing with me or etc.</br></br>

Anyhow I was going through all my mail I got right 'cause that name Kristen Turney sound and looked like I have seen it, but the one I found is community organizer. She help me with what I will say my start to filing for some changes with my case and the laws that change right. She send me paper on prop 57 and stuff like that! That I have been submitting to different places for help.</br></br>

Now is that the same person or am I tripping. Please if you don't mind me asking a few about your project. OK I would like to know more about this PPP and how it started (background) on it, and pretty much all that there is to know? How long has it been out?</br></br>

What other types of partners do y'all have? What is the reasons y'all started this project, like what motivates this project? I should of asked on my first letter but I wanted to answer yours that you had for me. But I am interested in this and I will help cause we do matter as well.</br></br>

Right! I understand you're a college student and y'all have a team at UCI. So if you don't mind I too will love to know what I'm getting myself into. Also you told me my name was found from a public list on CDCR website, if you don't mind me asking what website and why you chose me?</br></br>

Now I'm sure that I will let you know about me and you get to know me as well OK. Hope you understand me and hope I'm not being rude or disrespectful in anyway.</br></br>

I am Mexican/American. My parents are from Mexico, got five more siblings. We are a family of five boys and one sister which she pass away on July 2019. Well I was in prison.</br></br>

I just turned 29 years old this year and I'm in prison for ten years was the time I got. My year that I get out of prison is 2025 which I am praying is sooner than that due to all these laws that changed. I've made so many mistakes in my life, been in and out of jail for a very long time.</br></br>

I have join my gang when I was around 13 to 14 but I always idolize the gang life. I wanted to feel that I belong to something, wanted to be the one you would be looking at when I was around. My family background is gangsters too so yeah I wanted to be like them. Now I did not join their gang but the one where we had in our house at.</br></br>

It really took me to the age of 24 and a half, really 25 to really look at my life timeline and notice that I have been doing everything wrong. As a child I wanted to be a cholo gangster, wanted the tattoos and even wanted to come to prison as a kid. I thought it was cool. That I had a way of thinking right now.</br></br>

Now this time prison for has been so much pain and pain that I know these are years I will never get back and losing my sis really hit me the hardest, really made me see my life in a whole new way. Everyday that goes on in here is me getting myself to learn, educate my mind to know more than what I know.</br></br>

It is been so pain with all that happen in my life and what's going on in the world right. I have been really getting myself ready for the real life. I have been put in this world to live. I understand it will get hard 'cause of my background and 'cause of where I will be coming out of.</br></br>

I know that there will be times where it will get hard and I know now that it's not bad to ask or get help 'cause two is better than one sometimes. I've learned to be humble, treat people right, and to never give up on my goals.</br></br>

That's why when I got your letter in this time of my life when all this that is going on in the world, I feel it's a sign that I can make the best of myself. And I don't need to live that gangster life anymore. Which I have done it already in here. Stop all that gang stuff and just be a real grown man in my life.</br></br>

Yes I'm in prison and still haven't left so it's tough cause things happen in here between inmates you know, politics of our gang lives. But I have been doing all the best to stay away from all that and just keep doing my program. Who knows, maybe all this program found me to help me with what I am going through right.</br></br>

I have lost family with all this pandemic and I know I will never see, or spend time with them, couldn't even say goodbye. It's really painful going through all this alone in here. But I feel that me being alone well in prison has impacted my life now much more 'cause I don't blame anyone but myself for coming here right.</br></br>

I accept all the things that has happen to me right. But will I let that bring me down, no way! Now I will cut this here cause I'm running out of space right and if your project can send me writing stuff to me so I can keep writing I would highly appreciate.</br></br>

I do not ask family for anything 'cause they barely get by out there and I tend to not ask them for anything. I pretty much do everything here to get by while in prison. I draw for inmates and they pay me for it with things I need to get by and make my time go OK.</br></br>

I don't have much but I will do and partake on anything that is good for myself. So that's all for this letter and on the envelope there is a fine print on things we can get and writing paper we can get which would really be useful to keep writing.</br></br>

Please ask me and I will tell no lie for I will keep it real and honest always. Well hope y'all be safe and just let me know what I can help y'all project with I'm in. Thank you for your time reading this. Sincerely.</br></br>

There is so much more about my life that I left out but if you ask me anything, I will answer back with the truth. Always real.
