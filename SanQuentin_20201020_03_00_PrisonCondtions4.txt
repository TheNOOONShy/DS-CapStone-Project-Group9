So eventually the- within a week, the- the plant operations engineers came through to start putting power to the cells because the guys have little chargers and things to- for batteries, for CD players, to listen to radio. There was no TV, there was no nothing. And a lot of guys, a lot of us, you got to have a TV, that's how you see the world.</br></br>

Otherwise, you got concrete walls, and the cells are tiny. The cells are four and a half feet wide by 10 feet. And you got two guys in there, and it's rough.</br></br>

But this was just single cell, which I understand now that they've started moving people back. The viruses burn through, there's less cases, so a lot of guys are now still single cells. They gutted the chapels, they pulled all the pews out of the Catholic chapel, all the benches are out and the seats and everything, and they took all the churches apart and made them bed for COVID.</br></br>

They did the same thing to PIA, which is the Prison Industry Authority. That's the mattress factory and the furnish factory that guys are work in, they gutted the whole thing in space for beds. The gym, which was for recreation.</br></br>

They set up tents on the lower yard that look like field hospital tents, big ones big like- put guys in there, just so they can spread people out because they've known for years that this is- there's no way for social distancing. I mean, you can't even keep a social distance from your cellmate or your cellie or your cell next door. If you go to the bars, there's bars, there's not doors, and that thing is bars itâ€™s wide open out into- And you got a guy you could- if you could, you could just reach around and grab his hand, let alone be socially distanced from a guy in your cell.</br></br>

So if he's got it and you don't, well, you're there- you're quarantined with him. It's- it's San Quentin was built for single cell. It was built for like a maximum of a couple of thousand.</br></br>

And when I got there in 2010, there was over 6,000 people. They had people in the gym, they had people triple bunk. Well, once they get away with it long enough to have two guys in a cell, that's- they welded the bunks in.</br></br>

They have two guys in a cell that was built for one. That's it- that becomes normal. Do that for a decade and it's well, it's just what we do.</br></br>

Well, it's unhealthy and it's wrong. But that was kind of a digression from the COVID but that was absolutely what made it spread like wildfire. And people were washing, they were giving us little bottles of sanitizer thing, but not much.</br></br>
