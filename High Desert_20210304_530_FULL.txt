This letter was written by a person incarcerated at High Desert.</br></br>Hello PrisonPandemic. First of all, thank you for taking the time to care for prisoners. Not an easy thing to do.</br></br>I really do not know what is bad, really bad, or good.</br></br>I have been in prison for 23 years. I only know of the difference through the news. The differences from life on the outside and in prison.</br></br>But then one knows that the news exaggerates. Some news are totally fake. Most of the news focus on things that not even important to us prisoners.</br></br>So, do you see my point. I know about the real world through my family. Then again, my family is poor. Poor people lived the world way different than rich people. No, they don’t see the world different, they lived it different.</br></br>Like all the senators and house representatives. None of them or their immediate family have struggle just to find work. They get pay regardless of if they do the work for the people or not.</br></br> Why bring up my family. If you asked for my story. Well, if my family does good. I do good because they are able to help me. But if they can barely eat? Then how can they help me.</br></br> Obviously, prison through the pandemic has been horrible. Everything was worse. Till right now.</br></br>The worst thing about the prison system is that they keep us uninform. That is a form of torture. They cut your communication. Keep you in your cell for 60 days. Without any information. That is with everything. Program, quarantine, etc.</br></br>I really miss visits. Every human being needs the human touch. The human touch of our love ones.</br></br>I am not that fortunate to have a family that has $1,500 to spend for two days of visiting. Yes, that is how much it cost for me to get a visit.</br></br>CDCR may tell the outside world their focus and priority is to keep us stay in touch with our love ones.</br></br>But it is not the truth. They know where we all lived on the streets. Yet they always send you too far from your family.</br></br>The proof. There is two prisons that are only two hours away from where my family lives. Yet in 23 years I have never been that close to my family. It is always 12, eight, seven hours away from them.</br></br>It is obvious that, yes, I have requested to be close to home.</br></br>Now with the pandemic, there is a lot of people that do get visits. A lot of people. But now they are stress out, relationships get broken. Why? There is no physical contact. I can see them going through it.</br></br>There is so many people that depend on their families.</br></br> The phone is another way of fast communication. But even that is hard to use. I have no real reason why the prison make it so difficult to let inmates use the phone to communicate with out love ones.</br></br>I have a job from 4:00am till 11:30am. I get to use the phone once or sometimes twice a week.</br></br> I have two sisters, one daughter, one girlfriend/ex, two nieces, two brothers, one son, one granddaughter. So, I have to choose whom I talk to for 13 minutes.</br></br> Specifically, right now with no visits. Just imagine I am stress out with these situation. And I am use to not getting a lot of visits. I got three visits in eight years in this prison.</br></br>So, I depend on the phone. When one has not talked to someone for four weeks or longer, 15 minutes are like nothing. You can almost never finish a conversation.</br></br>Our phone calls are always getting shorted or cut by the COs. That is another bad thing.</br></br>So, if I get stress out, just imagine that people that are used to getting visits? They can’t use the phone as much neither. So, it is terrible.</br></br> As far as COVID, well the way the prison manage the situation was a mess. I don’t have to see the real world to see what the prison did wrong. First of all, the COs blame medical, medical blame the COs.</br></br>I can see the news. The government did it wrong too.</br></br>The first time someone got sick in building five, they should have lock down the whole building for 10 days. But no! Their idea was to start moving every individual that had any symptoms. That only spread COVID everywhere in the prison.</br></br> Then, they put in another inmate inside the cell. Where the sick person was just in, without cleaning the cell. So that person that was not sick now is sick.</br></br>Like always CDC threaten you with a 115 if you don’t want to move. Or, if you don’t want to accept someone in your cell. They don’t know, they don’t care if he is sick or not.</br></br>These went on for about 70 days. In those 70 days, we had no information about anything. We had no store, no phones, no programs, no work. Nothing.</br></br>I supposedly got sick. Yet, the first day they said there was a sick person in the building, me and my celly stayed inside the cell. We did not come out at all. But medical was forcing everyone to take their vital. They were touching everyone with the same pair of gloves. So, that is how I know by common sense. They spread it to everyone.</br></br>It really seem as if they were doing this thing on purpose. To get everyone sick. It made no sense to do that. It made no sense to start moving people that were sick to A, C, D yard, spreading COVID to every yard. That was not smart.</br></br>Unless that was the idea. To spread COVID to every yard. Maybe the prison got COVID relief money for every case?</br></br>Then again, COVID did nothing to me. But I am the type of person that does not expect to heal without doing nothing on my part.</br></br>I eat healthy. I exercise. I am aware of all my surroundings. A lot of the people that still got side effects, breathing problems, etc., they are overweight. They eat too much, don’t exercise enough, and share stuff with others.</br></br> So yes, there was nothing some of us could do. When the prison forces you to cell up with someone that had COVID or put us inside a cell without cleaning it, when the last person had COVID.</br></br> But I can clean the cell myself. Eat healthy. Exercise. And not share things with people.</br></br>A lot of the prison population has received the second shot against COVID. I received the first.</br></br> I don’t take shot usually. But seen how things are, I am taking this one. That way I won’t get excluded from participating on the regular program. Whenever it opens up.</br></br>I can tell you that prison has change for the better. It was terrible six to five years ago.</br></br> Thank you once again for taking the interest on prisoner's well-being. Thank you. And everyone involved on helping you.</br></br> You must be a kind person. Thank you.</br></br> I hope you’re not disappointed at my story. I try to be realistic and see the things for what they really are.</br></br>Respectfully.
