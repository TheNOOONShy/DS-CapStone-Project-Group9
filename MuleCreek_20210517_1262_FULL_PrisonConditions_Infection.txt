Hello I’ve been referenced to you by a friend. I’ve always wanted to advocate for people in prison, because there’s so many wrong doings and a lot is unnecessary to be honest. I will be your inside scoop if you wish. I’ve been locked up for 16 years, I’ve been to eight prisons, and I could tell you some stories.</br></br> 

For now let’s stick to the pandemic situation.</br></br> 

First off it was believed that the positive results about COVID-19 sickness were inaccurate. Due to lack of symptoms and too many were allegedly sick, but feeling fine. Unlike people on the streets that were dying left and right, it was believed that it was budget motivated. The more sick people you got, the more money you received, right?</br></br> 

OK let’s move in to protocol on an inmate being positive with COVID-19. Instead of isolating individuals, and putting them locked away alone in a cell, they would move you, better said, shuffle you around to open areas with non-sick people for 14 days. If you actually did feel sick but you already served those 14 days of isolation, you would be ignored, and no medical attention was given.</br></br> 

After the fact we would get put in bad situations with our former cellmates not being available to us any longer and not having a choice on who to live with. Privileges were taken, yard time reduced, sometimes no shower for 72 hours. It’s a mess. It’s getting a lil better, but very slow.</br></br> 

OK, I will await your response in which I will give you more specific renderings of the situation. Thank you for your time.
