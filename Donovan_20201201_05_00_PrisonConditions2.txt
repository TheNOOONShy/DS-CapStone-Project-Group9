This story was told by a person incarcerated at Donovan.</br></br>

UCI: So do you find that, in your section, that you have more, I would say, health-conscious or, you know, very aware individuals, comparative to, maybe, the other parts of the facility?</br></br>Caller: Well, I know there could be more done, regarding the cleaning. What it is, is certain individuals just don't pick up after themselves. They're not really washing their hands.</br></br>So but there's one individual that has actually stepped up and actually is going above and beyond and making sure that all the floors are sprayed and that everything gets cleaned around here. He's not even assigned to the position.</br></br>UCI: That's great. I mean, you know, definitely, I think, it's been helping, obviously, with your facility. You know? It's kind of very rare right now.
