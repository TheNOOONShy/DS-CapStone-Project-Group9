This story was told by a person incarcerated at Ventura County Main Jail.</br></br>UCI: How is the situation currently with COVID-19 in your facility?</br></br>Caller: Well it continues to be like everyone is afraid. Well not me, because I already have my vaccine, but a lot of officers have been getting sick here and a lot of people are afraid well because, its people with health issues, but like right now they have it pretty controlled. All the people who have symptoms are placed in quarantine. And well yeah, I feel safer because they gave me my vaccine and everything, but still feel a tension with all the stuff that is happening.</br></br>UCI: Yes, I understand. You mentioned, you already got your vaccine, how has the vaccination status been like at your facility?</br></br>Caller: Well I think fast. They came to ask me two weeks before they vaccinated me if I wanted the vaccine and I told them yes. Well my cellmate got it first because he was already going to go to the prison and he has to go vaccinated. But there’s still people that don’t want to get vaccinated like my current cellmate right now. He says they’re going to put him the number of the beast with the vaccine. I have argued with things like this with him but I don’t get involved in what people think. I feel like it is going to help because, when I was younger I had asthma, and I am scared to contract Coronavirus because my aunt died due to Coronavirus in Mexico. And probably my grandma too, but my grandma passed away in February, we don’t know what really happened to her. But I think with the vaccine, if you want it, they give it to you fast.</br></br>UCI: Yes, and for the ones that want to get vaccinated, do they give them any information, or prepare them to make those decisions to get the vaccine?</br></br>Caller: I am going to say no; the truth is they only ask you if yes or no. Then, if they go to put you the vaccine, it’s whenever they want, with no questions they just tell you, well you’re in jail, you know. But like information which is which, they just tell you what it is. The truth I don’t remember which one I got, I only received one. I don’t remember which doses was it, but only one. But like for them to tell us this vaccine has this or another thing well no, they just tell you they are going to vaccinate you.</br></br>UCI: Oh okay. And also, you mentioned one of your family members passed away, my deepest condolences. I also wanted to ask you how has the COVID-19 situation affected your family members?</br></br>Caller: The truth, well a lot because my family here stopped working for a long time. My mom got sick with COVID, my sister got sick with COVID too, my brother in law too, only my brother didn’t get sick, I don’t know why, they all live in the same house. And the truth is it does make you think what’s going to happen because my mom was sick for almost a month, she wasn’t that bad but looking at how the situation is, we did not know if one of these days we were going to have to hospitalize her. Similar, my sister was a bit sick, not a lot but she was also not working for a period of time, well last year they stopped working. And it was difficult because we have to pay rent, food and everything.</br></br>And from my family side from Mexico we all suffered the passing of my aunt because she is the oldest from all of my uncles, and she’s the one that would oversee everything in the house with my other uncles and everything. And the truth, right now that she is not here, it’s a disaster in my house in Mexico because my aunts don’t like each other. Well it’s a mess, but the truth is COVID has affected us one way or another, it’s affected me and my family because they’ve gotten sick as well. And the people who surround me here, well I hear their family as well has been sick. But yes, it has affected us a lot to be honest.</br></br>UCI: Yes, I understand. And how are you dealing with the crisis?</br></br>Caller: Well, now I am not as bad or good, because I’m here inside. I think maybe my situation outside would have been worse because I am a drug addict, well I have a lot of problems with drugs and I think I would have gotten sick, and died of COVID. And I think about how I don’t spend it as bad or good. We’ll I’m almost going to come out, God first in eleven days, but this time I spent the whole pandemic inside. Since it started, because I got arrested in 2020 in January. And since then I have not been out up until today. And the truth is yes everything is restricted because everything changed inside, everything became like more difficult. People began to come out, a lot of people got out because they started to take out the cases that were not violent. And a lot of people left. From the people that were always here, about 40 percent or so left from the regular people that were left.</br></br>The truth is that that hurt a lot of us that were there because there weren’t people with whom to play with, there weren’t people with whom to conversate with. Basically, everything sunk here. No one would come out, no one would enter, the ones who were going to go to prison, couldn’t leave because of COVID. It was very tough, I had two attempted suicides while that happened. The truth because there’s nothing to relieve your pain, there’s no one to talk to or no one to play cards with. Even though I don’t really speak English, but everyone plays cards, and it’s a form of communicating with people.</br></br>And yes, the truth COVID, personally, did hit me hard because well my aunt passed away, my sister and my mom got sick. And I’m telling you everything that happened in jail, everything changed.</br></br>UCI: Yes, and how has It been for you to have reduced programs?</br></br>Caller: No, well it’s been very boring. All the time being locked up because their cleaning the sections. Almost all the time, if there’s no people, we sleep in cells, we live in cells. Well there’s a living room with television and everything, and in the living room they have some bunk beds in where more people live and with those people you communicate with, or play with. With those people, you get things and the truth is it’s very boring, a lot of free time, and the truth is you don’t need it all because you can’t do a lot of things.</br></br>UCI: Yes, is there anything else you would like people to know about your experience?</br></br>Caller: Yes, I don’t know, well don’t come to this place because the truth you have a bad time. I spent the whole pandemic, and the truth is, I’ll tell people to get vaccinated because the truth the situation I’ve seen it from this side, and it’s tough, because if you don’t get vaccinated you are prone to die. My aunt was not able to get the vaccine. I think if she would have gotten it, I think she would have survived or maybe lived longer with us.</br></br>Because the truth is she died really quick. And for the people to get vaccinated, to not pay attention to false information. That it’s not too difficult to believe in a vaccine that works, that can save your life, that it can change your life, because just as life can change if you save it, when something wrong happens it also changes it. And to all Hispanics give it all you got, we’ve always gone through things like these, and we are always going to overcome them, we are fighters. I want to thank you for giving me this time. And I think that’s all.</br></br>UCI: Thank you so much for sharing so much information. I am sorry about your family member’s passing.</br></br>Caller: Well thank you-
