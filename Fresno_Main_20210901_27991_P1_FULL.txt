This story was told by a person incarcerated at Fresno County Main Jail. 

Caller 1: You're the person I just spoke to a minute ago, right?</br></br>

UCI: Yes, it's me.</br></br>

Caller 1: Good. I didn't get to finish that address, but I do have a couple of other people that want to speak to you. Before I do so, I wanted to say that what we need most of all right now during this pandemic and this crisis and lockdown, it can happen for 21 days; they say we're locked down. We can't go to court. We have to stay in our cells. And remember, it's the size of a Starbucks. We're really close together. I mean, we have no room to move. We're hitting each other elbows all the time.</br></br>

There's certain things like the buttons don't work in here for emergencies. We can't contact staff for medical reasons, things like heart attacks, attempted suicide. We have self-mutilations happening all the time, attempted suicide. We've got to bang on the doors and stuff just to get somebody's attention.</br></br>

What we need most of all is free phone calls to our families. Because a lot of our families can't afford it - I don't have any family, I'm alone, but I'm speaking for the majority here. It's hard for them to speak because of various reasons; however, what we do need is free phone calls. That would help during this lockdown in quarantine. This would encourage and promote empathy and parenting.</br></br>

We have children we want to speak to, and we can't because we can't afford it, you know? It's really expensive, these phone calls. Our families are burdened right now because they can't work. There's no way to pay for them. So, that's what we're experiencing now is not being able to contact our families because we get no visits during quarantine.</br></br>

We have two phones for 55 guys. There's two phones inside this pod. So, if there was anybody out there who's interested in donating or finding a way to get free phone calls for our families during this quarantine, and this is not the whole prison or jail being quarantined, it's just A, J, D pod. Floor three. That means the old jail.</br></br>

UCI: Hm-mmm.</br></br>

Caller 1: So, those are the concerns right now. Because if it does spread or if the person that they isolated does have it, they're going to do cotton swabs within a couple days to test all of us here. They already checked our temperatures, and they were okay. However, that doesn't, you know, exclude us from being sick.</br></br>

I don't know how the symptoms are, but people have been sick to their stomachs lately and been using the toilet more often than usual. I don't know if that's a symptom or not. However, it's a concern. I'm not educated in biology - we don't have any information on the pandemic itself and what to look out for.</br></br>

UCI: Hm-mmm.</br></br>

Caller 1: I don't know if it's available, but it should be given to us regardless of if we ask for it or not. I think someone in authority should have implemented some kind of pamphlet in case we have these certain symptoms because everybody in here is a doctor, everybody's a lawyer, everybody's an expert in everything when you're in jail or in prison. So, everybody's got confusion on how to handle the situation. Everybody think they know the symptoms, but no one really does except a qualified expert.</br></br>

UCI: Hm-mmm.</br></br>

Caller 1: We need a qualified expert in your field to send us pamphlets or some kind of brochure explaining to us in-depth what the signs are of the flu or the flu that's about to come, this Delta thing, whatever you call it.
