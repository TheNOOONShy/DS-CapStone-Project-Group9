This letter was written by a person incarcerated at Tehachapi.</br></br>

If the prison really wanted to stop the spread here, they could but they don’t care. That’s what I think. If they test the whole population, staff and inmates, those that refuse should be quarantined also just to be safe. And they should pass out better masks and enforce the masks and social distance on everyone.</br></br>

They should have been passing out more soap to everyone and disinfectant to clean our cells. They told us to do this and that to stay safe but they don’t follow their own rules so inmates stop trying. Somehow I caught the virus again and now I’m on quarantine along with several other inmates. Which they just kept us here in the same section with general population.</br></br> 

Except from taking us to the quarantine building to isolate us.</br></br>

This time the virus really hit me with symptoms. Fever for three days that would have me sweating in my sleep. Shaking chills feeling like I’m freezing, muscle aches, headaches, runny and congested nose, poor appetite, and a weird chest pain if I breath in hard. All they do for me is take my vitals twice a day and leave me confined to my cell.</br></br> 

“If your symptoms get worse then put in a medical slip so we can come see you.”</br></br>

What has it been like to have reduced visitation from family and loved ones?</br></br>

I haven’t seen my family since I came to prison. They kept putting me in prisons far from home. So I’m used to it already but I wouldn’t risk my family’s health just for a visit. I been waiting five years.</br></br> 

I know I can wait more until it’s safe and I’m closer home to them. They did start doing visits over the computers. Everyone gets one every 30 days. I haven’t had one.</br></br>

How have you been coping with this crisis?</br></br>

I’m just trying to keep my health so this virus don’t mess me up bad. I want to make it home to my family so I can be helpful to them in these crazy times. All I can do is continue exercising to get my lungs back in shape and hope and pray my family are safe.</br></br> 

Hopefully once the virus slows down in prison they can allow me to transfer closer to my family. Maybe I will finally get to see them.
